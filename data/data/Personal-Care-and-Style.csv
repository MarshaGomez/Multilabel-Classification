how to get dimples naturally,dimples are small folds or indentations in the fleshy part of the cheek they are the result of a minor muscle deformity which causes the skin of the cheek to draw tightly as it moves creating external divots this adorable facial feature is usually a genetically inherited trait however people born without natural dimples can successfully mimic their appearance through a variety of methods ranging from the simple makeup to the drastic surgery 1 x research source,pucker your lips and suck your cheeks in to start exercising your cheek muscles make a face as though you just ate a lemon or something remarkably sour your lips should be in a slight pucker or pout and your cheeks should be partially sucked in your teeth should not be clenched together as this can prevent you from sucking your cheeks in but your lips do need to be closed 2 x research source note this method is a folk remedy in other words it s not supported by any sort of scientific evidence but rather by vague unverifiable anecdotal evidence thus it is not guaranteed to work your cheeks should naturally indent inward with the deepest part of the indentation resting in between your top and bottom teeth roughly halfway between the front and back of your mouth try eating or drinking something sour if you have a hard time imagining the appropriate facial expression your natural reaction to sourness is what this exercise is imitating 3 x research source press and hold the indentations locate the areas on your cheeks where the indentations are the deepest gently hold this spot down on both cheeks using both index fingers keep your fingers firmly fixed to these spots as you prepare to move your mouth you can also hold these spots with your thumb or the rounded end of a pencil if you find it easier smile and reposition your fingers as necessary gradually ease your expression into a wide grin keeping your fingers fixed to the same spots on your face your smile should be wide and open mouthed as natural dimples generally appear when someone has a fairly wide smile your fingers should now be positioned near the corners of your smile where dimples would naturally occur if you had them 4 x research source check your appearance in a mirror if the location of your fingertips seems slightly off you may need to slightly slide your fingertips across your cheeks to the proper location press your desired dimple area firmly with your fingertips or with the rounded end of a pencil for temporary dimples release immediately take a picture if desired 5 x research source note that these dimples will disappear as soon as you relax your mouth continue pressing for 30 minutes or more to train your cheeks into forming more lasting dimples you will need to continue to firmly hold these indentations in place for at least 30 minutes the longer you can hold your dimple marks in place the more luck you will have in getting them to last in the past there were actually mechanical devices aimed at creating dimples by applying consistent pressure to these spots on your face 6 x research source these devices were never scientifically proven to work but some swore by them this dimple exercise mimics the action of such a machine repeat daily continue practicing 30 minute dimple exercises on a daily basis for several weeks if a month passes and you still have not created lasting dimples you may want to move on since this technique is not supported by scientific evidence but by hearsay if you don t eventually have success it may simply not work for you smile wide look into a mirror and smile a wide but natural smile gauge the general location where you want your fake dimples to be 7 x research source when you smile natural creases should form outside of your mouth your dimples should fall just outside of these creases beginning roughly around the area just above the upper points of your lips make sure to smile broadly but not unnaturally so real dimples are most prominent during particularly wide smiles so you will get a better idea for where your cosmetic dimples should be if you make a wide grin rather than a reserved one don t be shy note this method works best to create temporary dimples suitable for pictures it may look unnatural if worn out in public mark the tops of your new dimples dimples usually appear as short lines or slight crescent shapes using a dark brown pencil eyeliner or eyebrow pencil make a small dot at the top of where you want your desired dimple line to be 8 x research source dark brown works bests because it blends into the skin more naturally black and colored eyeliner should be avoided draw a small crescent moon shape on your cheek with the tops of your dimples marked relax your mouth draw a small slightly curved line starting at the dot you have marked use the same eyeliner or eyebrow pencil you used to create the dot 9 x research source the line should extend no further than 1 inch 2 5 cm below the dot it should be just barely curved slightly straighter than the curve of a fingernail blend and re draw as necessary now that your dimples have been drawn on you need to adjust your makeup so that the final product appears subtle and natural use your fingers or a smudge stick to blend the line into your skin rubbing the line up and down rather than side to side 10 x research source one application may not create a line of suitable darkness so you may need to draw over the line and blend it in several times smile to check your results critique your new dimples in the

compulsive nature of the mind that creates separation immense suffering and problems by keeping the psychological burden of past and future alive then you will naturally stop seeking yourself in it as it d be insane to seek yourself in mind that creates suffering and drains you of life energy its the excessive reliance and identification with mind that makes thinking compulsive self serving and the mind which is an instrument takes over your life there s more to you than movement of thought emotions and your ephemeral form as you are not some meaningless fragment in an alien uncaring universe you are here to enable the divine purpose of universe to unfold that is how important you are eckhart tolle shift or withdraw attention from the mind and its resistive patterns to now once you

tainted with madness what s the madness treating the now as an obstacle or enemy or means to an end while the paradox is that there s nothing more important than being in the now it is because now is the only time there is and point to access the presence or consciousness within life that you are inseparable from one life so you don t need time or achieve acquire become something or understand a

mental image of you with the mental image of others in order to feel superior defend or repair diminished false sense of self or attempt to destroy them with negative comments or judgments it can also try to associate with others if it can t compete in order to enhance its ultimately fictitious self image it s all happening on auto pilot as part of ego s defense mechanism and your whole sense of self is derived from conditioning of your limited mind that is based on experiences knowledge beliefs and memories i e past he who tries to shine dims his own light tao te ching on the level of form you are always going to be more or less than others but in essence you are neither superior nor inferior and essence one life underneath myriad of fleeting forms is what matters absolutely nothing real can be threatened nothing unreal exists herein lies the peace of god course of miracles here s a powerful spiritual practice next time you feel an urge to shine or compare or repair or defend the diminished form based identity ego simply yield and inhabit your inner body or do nothing allow the ego to remain diminished this makes way for your true power to shine through the perfect complete and timeless awareness that you are in essence thus realizing how insignificant are comparing and competing you may not always become the mountain but you can always go deeper into the valley of the

achieve tao te ching this one decision i e inner shift from object consciousness mind stuff to space consciousness inner space will change your entire reality and add a depth to your life that you didn t know you had is it that easy yes it is that easy however this one decision you d have to make again and again and again until abiding in state of inner spaciousness or presence or being becomes your natural state on the level of form there s nothing you can do or achieve or lose or become to enhance or diminish the simple joy of being as in your essence you are complete and perfect now so you don t need time to be who you are in essence this is the formless perfection that tao te ching points to in the phrase there was something formless and perfect before the universe was born it is serene empty solitary unchanging infinite eternally present it is the mother of the universe for lack of a better name i call it the tao once you abide in the death less state of being you realize that there is no death and body and forms around are part of illusory divine game that sages of ancient india called as leela it will be painful as long as you cling to the illusion and seek your self in it tao te ching states know the white yet keep to the black which means know and honor the forms yet keep to the formless and deathless essence stay rooted in being when you inhabit your spacious inner body you are connected to the vibrant high frequency of one consciousness 9 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste

in other words its the end of suffering and mind as your master enlightenment is your most natural state not some superhuman accomplishment that you need to work hard to attain however egoic mind likes to keep it superhuman all mind can do and know is to cut things into fragments analyze and can at most show you the relative truth via thinking while thinking can never the grasp the totality and is intrinsic part of the egoic dysfunction in other words problems of the mind cannot be solved at the level of mind it s only when you step out of your mind can you realize the oneness and sacredness underneath all forms only sacredness within can recognize sacredness without this is why be aware of any deeper feeling responses as you read if you tried to understand with your mind you will fail there s nothing to understand can you step back from your own mind and thus understand all things tao te ching although trying to understand with your mind can also become part of your spiritual journey because eventually it may force you to realize that mind is limited and cannot dissolve the egoic dysfunction as you will read later practice asking the inner body rather than the mind since inner body is infinitely more intelligent and peaceful than mind so feel your inner body as much as you can especially when facing challenging people conditions situations or when you have to make a decision you can also see it as an experiment and then observe the quality and creativity of your words and actions and degree of peace within you when you use your mind in conjunction with inner body if inhabiting inner body is not easy such as when mind s momentum or activity is high then become aware of your breath as its easier and a powerful meditation practice in itself this will gradually get you in touch with inner body you can also be aware of breath and inner body at the same time since they are closely linked together if that s not possible then become aware of sense perceptions remove yourself from the situation take action keep yourself busy accept what is etc whichever feels easier read stay rooted in being for more present moment practices be aware of mental interpretation or conceptualization since egoic structures are quite deep seated you may not even realize that mind has cleverly conceptualized some of the pointers in the article and started acting from them read surrender to the present moment for more insight that s the core error and deeply embedded pattern that we are referring to i e unconsciously seeking answers and self in mind and world rather than inner body or being so a high alertness is needed to catch the mind tricking you into identifying with it mind motivated actions responses and interpretations ultimately lead to suffering and misery because they arise out of negativity are intrinsically short sighted unintelligent treat the now as an obstacle or means to an end keep the undesirable situation in place and contain the unmanifested polar opposite law of polar opposite says in the realm of mind nothing could exist without its opposite 12 x research source tolle eckhart i a new earth i vancouver bc penguin 2005 page 17 163 in other words positive already contains its unmanifested negative for example high of a drug changes to hangover and depletion the next day that s why buddha said even your happiness is dukkha suffering only illusion of time separates them similarly be aware in case being aware of inner body or other present moment anchors or watching the mind leads or misinterprets to check if the negativity or thoughts are gone you may not realize that your checking could actually be subtle resistance or controlling in form of reactions and or thoughts and or physical movements in tongue heart face hand brain muscles etc caused by the clever mind to re energize itself this checking is similar to clinging or interfering with the condition of sore throat by swallowing every few moments to check if its healed or not if you look deeply its the clinging and interference conditioned mental reactions that make you suffer more than sore throat and interfere with the healing process you need to be very alert to detect and then accept the slight or subtle or unconscious resistance or reactions else mind will creep in without you being aware of it again more thinking resistance or reactions cannot solve the dysfunction of mind now is the key presence is the key so no need to check if thoughts are gone or not thought movement ceases or slows down naturally and automatically when your attention is in the now stay at the center of the circle and let everything fall into place tao te ching deeply realize that the seemingly helpful thought which says check if the thoughts are gone is itself an obstacle to access the power of now it s cause you are seeking answer in thought form that is to say you are following or looking at the mind for the truth which at most can be a pointer also if you look closely seemingly helpful and spiritual sounding conditioned thoughts and mind s rigid expectations like why compulsive thinking is not dissolving or thoughts are still there or check if the thoughts are gone or i should be in inner body or present moment i am not deeply in the now i will lose this peace you are still not free of the ego etc make you lose presence re energize compulsive thinking and mental patterns and keep them in place its because they arise out of non acceptance and cloud presence light emanating from eternal source in other words these thoughts and reactions justify the reason for your unhappiness but in reality cause it they may be helpful during your spiritual journey but can become great obstacles if used as crutch and not recognized as conditioned thoughts hence detecting and watching or accepting the resistive or conditioned thoughts and reactions including physical and psychological is even more important than involuntary thinking see the unintelligent nature of mind mind thinks that its resistance will dissolve the undesirable condition or situation for example mind s usual response to prevent or dissolve an unwanted emotion thought condition or situation arises out of negativity in form of resistance control fighting complaining compulsive thinking reaction etc because it thinks negativity will dissolve them this is highly delusional and unintelligent because resistance is more disturbing and negative than the emotion or thoughts or situation or condition it s trying to dissolve plus resistance keeps them in place hence the zen saying whatever you resist persists it may seem like that the situation or person or condition are causing the suffering or unease but in truth its the automatic resistive thoughts and emotions that come in response to them once you see this truth you naturally relinquish resistance and hence get closer to the infinite primordial intelligence and serenity that comes from deep within this is how close you are to the reality of god offer no inner opposition inhabiting inner body may get conceptualized by the mind as forcing yourself to be in the inner body using willpower again it s deeply embedded in our psyche to approach things via mind thoughts reactions and emotions that sometimes even before the mental reaction becomes a thought you have already acted in form of words or action that arise out of mental conditioning so be highly alert by being in touch with aliveness of inner body to detect deep seated mental patterns there could be a conflict between polarizing thoughts about forcing and being in the body naturally which are both mental positions if that happens allow or accept them to be you are the seeing not the condition or thoughts that are seen if you simply offer no inner opposition or resistance to whatever arises it dissolves naturally without any effort that s the power and miracle of surrender its the effort or opposition or will that gives the mind renewed strength don t look at the closed door mind but go deeply into the open door of inner body and awareness again once you recognize mind s dysfunction and madness then there s nothing you can do to dissolve it only awareness or inner space can free you from it that is to say complete surrender and or withdrawal of attention from mind to inner body or other present moment anchors is the key you won t die in fact you will be liberated from the great burden of false self that cuts you off from source 13 x research source tolle eckhart i a new earth i vancouver bc penguin 2005 page 45 73 with suffering and pain being inevitable consequences of this disconnect words or forms are no more than stepping stones or sign posts to be left as quickly as possible so any spiritual pointer or text that are collection of words will become obstacles sooner or later if you used them as a crutch truth is beyond any words or forms look and it can t be seen listen and it can t be heard reach and it can t be grasped above it isn t bright below it isn t dark seamless unnameable it returns to the realm of nothing form that includes all forms image without an image subtle beyond all conception approach it and there is no beginning follow it and there is no end you can t know it but you can be it at ease in your own life tao te ching feel the inner energy field of body feel one part of the body wherever it feels easy and hold your attention there for as long as it feels natural for example feel the aliveness in your shoulders and hold your attention there when it feels natural and easy move on to other body parts like hands head face neck shoulders lungs back abdomen genitals hips thighs knees shins calves ankles feet etc then feel the body as whole as a global sense of aliveness don t be in a haste to move on to other parts as mind may say something like other body parts are being left you are not your mind so why give it reality let your awareness meander in comfort this will naturally deepen presence or awareness the master views the parts with compassion because he understands the whole his constant practice is humility he doesn t glitter like a jewel but lets himself be shaped by the tao as rugged and common as stone tao te ching its not you but the universal consciousness that acts through you so let the tao consciousness that is essentially you and yet inconceivably greater that you guide you and act through you that s the paradox life is the dancer you are the dance eckhart tolle either way don t try or you will fail and suffer as trying implies mental effort or will power which means you are still attempting to dissolve the dysfunction of mind at the level of mind this is no different than a cop looking for a kidnapper when kidnapper is the cop if you are aware enough you may notice emotions reactions urges unease willing trying etc or physical movement or tension in brain face tongue and heart muscles etc however slight or subtle as if trying to control fight suppress or resist in an attempt to become present or dissolve the mental patterns undesirable situation and accumulated past in your psyche this is utterly futile and causes further suffering being aware which also implies accepting what is to be is all that is needed although the urge to try may come automatically and put you into trying mode because its conditioned in that case keep trying and don t force yourself to not try which is another strategy of the mind flourishing of trying as pointed in tao te ching eventually will force you to accept and go beyond it if you want to get rid of something allow it to flourish tao te ching keep the gate keeper occupied since the mind thinking has a great momentum so it s a pragmatic practice to replace or merge mind activity with creative or constructive or funny or spiritual content practices and activities as it helps withdraw attention from mind to the now as an analogy it s like keeping the gate keeper mind occupied with magazines content or conversation thus allowing people available attention to sneak in flow into the body for most people spiritual awakening is a gradual process if you haste you will fail because it implies that you are treating the now as an obstacle or means to an end the most precious thing there is although you can accelerate the process by ending the delusion of time making the now the primary focus of your life withdrawing attention from mind refusing to harbor thoughts etc in other words become friendly with present moment or live as if there is no past or future but the eternal now because that s the only time there is for more pragmatic practices read stay rooted in being choose joy and peace of being as your consciousness or presence deepens you will see more clearly how peaceful and joyous it is when you are rooted in inner body and awareness and how unhappy lost and discontent you feel when your attention is trapped in useless and repetitive thinking reactions and the world as egoic mind and suffering are synonymous analogy being in inner body is like being with a very intelligent grandmother she s gentle loving yielding forgiving kind yet very powerful while being in mind is like having over bearing parents who are short sighted dramatic torment you constantly unyielding controlling resent to make you feel guilty in order to fulfill their wishes create disconnection overly strict etc once you see this you may choose to step out of your mind into the loving embrace of your being or inner space and thus become one with life within rather than having the consciousness be absorbed by mind and turned into pointless thinking analysis unease mind stuff and seeking fleeting experiences things and scraps of short lived pleasures in the external world which sooner or later turns to suffering if you seek long lasting fulfillment in them world of forms can give you pleasure but it will also give you pain however nothing can give you joy because joy and peace arise from the formless dimension within 14 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 48 that s the peace of god however as long as you are dominated by your mind you have very little or no choice 15 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 228 as choice implies a high degree of consciousness so be alert and present as the watcher of mind or it will creep in in your absence go deeper voluntarily once you reach a certain level of consciousness and had several glimpses or experiences of awakening feeling realization of one life within and with out you have the power to make a conscious choice to inhabit being or inner space or now voluntarily rather than be motivated by suffering which means less and less explanations or reasoning or engaging or identifying with mind waiting for suffering accumulating experiences getting lost in mind or world s drama providing mind with evidence or even watching the mind you voluntarily step out of your mind or we can say you yield or withdraw or shift attention away from mental static or noise closed door to inner space and or now thus becoming one with the source within this will rapidly deepen and transform your reality however you will not make that decision unless you truly realize that you are not your mind or become fed up of suffering or have complete faith in being within you may have the belief that thinking is a great gift and without it you may not be able to function in the world which is another mind s strategy to keep you trapped in time what mind doesn t know or want you to know is that thinking in absence of space consciousness that is true intelligence is the collective dysfunction or sickness greatest obstacle to awakening 16 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 33 infact mind thought which is a wonderful instrument works beautifully and creatively when its rooted in awareness 17 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 189 this is the feeling of space consciousness that albert einstein pointed to when he said the scientist s religious feeling takes the form of a rapturous amazement at the harmony of natural laws which reveals an intelligence of such superiority that compared with it all systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection this feeling is the guiding principle of my life and work,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to clean nail art brushes after use,nail art brushes are one of the most important tools of the nail trade if you ve ever reached for a brush and found a clump of dried product you probably understand how important regular cleaning is to keep your brushes in great condition wipe your brushes frequently as you apply gel polish or acrylic pigment once you finish a set clean all of the product out of the bristles so the brushes will be ready for nail art at a moment s notice,pour acetone or non acetone polish remover into a small glass acetone does a great job of loosening and removing paint from brush bristles but it is harsh and can dry out the bristles choose acetone for synthetic bristles or non acetone nail polish remover for bristles made with natural fibers 1 x research source if you just cleaning a few brushes pour about 2 tablespoons 30 ml of the polish remover into a shot glass dip the detail brush bristles into the remover and swish it for 10 to 20 seconds if you just finished painting nail designs with your detail brush you ll see most of the paint come out within 10 seconds if some of the paint has started to dry swish the brush gently and keep it in the remover until you see that the paint is out of the bristles 2 x research source since detail brushes are some of the most delicate brushes you probably work with don t push down hard on the brush or you may bend the bristles blot the brush bristles on a paper towel or cotton pad lay a clean paper towel or cotton pad flat on your work surface and take lift the detail brush out of the polish remover dab the bristles on the towel so it absorbs the moisture 3 x research source turn the brush as you dab the bristles so you get all of the polish remover out of them brush cuticle oil onto the bristles to condition them pour a few drops of cuticle oil into a dish and dab the bristles of your clean detailing brush in the oil turn the brush so all of the bristles are evenly coated then dab the brush on a clean part of the paper towel to get rid of excess oil 4 x research source if the bristles aren t holding their shape use your clean fingers to gently bring the bristles together soak a cotton pad in isopropyl alcohol get out a package of lint free cotton pads and set them at your work station carefully pour just enough isopropyl alcohol on it to soak the pad completely then lay it flat on your work surface 5 x research source 71 isopropyl alcohol 99 isopropyl alcohol and rubbing alcohol are all effective at cleaning gel polish from your brushes rubbing alcohol is essentially a mixture of isopropyl and ethyl alcohol diluted with water unlike acrylic brushes gel brushes are made with synthetic bristles so it s safe to use alcohol on them wipe both sides of the gel brush on the pad after painting a few nails one of the best ways to prevent gel polish from gumming up your brush is to brush it on the alcohol soaked pad after doing every couple of nails just wipe both sides of the brush onto the pad to remove the polish then you can keep painting 6 x research source this also helps new gel polish spread onto the nail easier wipe the handle of the brush with a soaked pad to remove stickiness painting nails with a sticky brush can be really annoying if you notice that the handle feels tacky take a cotton pad soaked in isopropyl alcohol and wipe it on the handle until it feels smooth 7 x research source swish the bristles in isopropyl alcohol to deep clean your brushes once a day once you ve completely finished painting a set of gel nails spend a minute thoroughly cleaning your brush pour about 1 inch 2 5 cm of isopropyl alcohol into a small dish and dip the bristles into it swish your brush back and forth a few times and take it out then press it gently against a dry cotton pad to remove the excess alcohol 8 x research source if you re applying glitter to the nails you ll probably need to deep clean the bristles after you finish so you don t leave glitter in the brush you don t need to buy brush cleanser for your gel brushes if you read the ingredients on most of these products they re actually made with isopropyl alcohol put the cap on each brush before you store it horizontally the cap protects the bristles from getting bent but if your brushes don t have caps don t worry you can buy brush holders at most art or beauty supply stores these might have horizontal dividers so you can push the brushes onto the holder and they won t roll away or rest on the bristles if you have vertical brush storage put the brush handles into the slots so the bristles are pointing straight up 9 x research source laying the brushes horizontally or vertically doesn t put pressure on the bristles never store your brushes with the bristles pointed down since this will push them out of shape pour monomer into a small dish you don t want to dip a dirty brush directly into your bottle of monomer which can contaminate it so pour a small amount into a clean dappen dish if you prefer keep a separate bottle of monomer just for cleaning your brushes this way you can swish the brush right in the bottle and save a little time 10 x research source check your local beauty supply store for acrylic nail supplies like the monomer pigment and dappen dish if you don t have the small heavy dappen dish for dipping your brush use any small glass dish like a shot glass monomer the acrylic liquid that you mix with the pigment is gentler on the brush bristles since it doesn t contain acetone which is frequently included in brush cleansers saturate the bristles in monomer and wipe the brush on a cotton pad once you ve finished creating a set of acrylic nails dip your brush into the dish of monomer then lay a dry cotton pad on your work surface and wipe the brush across it keep soaking the bristles with monomer and wiping until you don t see any traces of acrylic pigment on the pad 11 x research source to prevent the bristles from getting fuzzy use a lint free pad or paper towel dip the bristles in acetone briefly if acrylic has cured in the bristles if you notice a clump of dried acrylic in the bristles of your

likely work from a stencil which is basically like a temporary tattoo this is the most common way that professional tattoo artists provide a guide from which to work 7 x research source draw the design on a sheet of paper or print it out from your computer then place the design on the stencil paper use a stencil liquid like stencilstuff or stencilpro and spread the liquid over the area place

line up the needle with the guide line and get started you need to start the machine to get the needle moving before you attempt to start the tattoo never stick the needle into the skin before turning it on using your other hand keep the skin to be tattooed as tight and flat as possible it s very important to give yourself a good canvas on which to tattoo the flatter the better some tattoo guns can be auto loaded with ink by screwing a canister of tattoo ink directly into the gun if you have access to one of these guns you don t need to dip the needle obviously push the needle into your skin it s very difficult to push a tattooing needle in too deeply because of the design of the needle will keep it from happening but you do need to make sure it goes deep enough at least a few millimeters as you do start moving it along the outline of your design 10 x research source your skin should tug just a bit on the needle when you pull it out but bleeding should be minimal if your skin doesn t resist when you pull the needle out it s probably too shallow if there is a lot of blood the needle is too deep because the needle is difficult to see it s usually better to tilt the needle at a diagonal to the skin resting the tube rests on the skin outline your design move the needle slowly down your stencil line don t go farther than a few centimeters along your outline before you remove the needle wipe the excess ink off and keep going take your time and look closely at the line quality to make sure you re giving an even tattoo 11 x research source the needle will be moving so it s

your tattoo continue tracing along the lines of your tattoo wiping the excess ink off as you go and re upping the ink on the needle as you work keep a close eye on what you re doing and the thickness of the line high quality tattoos will have very even line work making it important that you use consistent pressure and evenness 12 x research source filling in the tattoo is generally done with a slightly larger needle and instead of moving in straight lines you move in gentle tiny circles to fill in the area for your first tattoo this may be unnecessary but feel free to experiment keep the stylus clean wet the needle periodically before putting more ink onto it cleaning the excess ink off the needle is absolutely essential for cleanliness and a good tattoo job if you set your needle anywhere other than the ink dish and your skin stop and sterilize again it with a clean paper towel and rubbing alcohol be sure it s dry before you continue wipe away the excess ink regularly every few repetitions use a soft paper towel to wipe away excess ink and seeping blood from your tattoo use a fresh towel each time gently clean the tattoo as soon as you re done apply a thin layer of tattoo ointment typically called a d or tattoo goo and cover the tattoo with clean gauze fresh tattoo work needs to be protected as soon as you re finished to minimize the risk of infection 13 x research source never put lotion or petroleum jelly on a fresh tattoo these clog the pores draw the ink out and keep the tattoo from healing effectively it s a common misconception that vaseline or petroleum jelly is used on new tattoos the ointment used does resemble the consistency of vaseline but it s not the same thing don t slather ointment onto the tattoo you only need a small pea sized amount for most tattoos it s important to let the tattoo heal as quickly and naturally as possible which it can t do if its constantly covered in goop don t immediately wash your tattoo if you used sterile products you should let the tattoo alone and let the inflammation calm down a bit before you try to clean it cover the tattoo and leave it alone bandage up 14 x research source use a clean soft gauze bandage to completely cover the tattoo be gentle as the area will likely be somewhat tender from the tattooing process bind it in place with medical tape or stretch wrapping loosely leave the bandage on the tattoo for at least the first two hours if not the rest of the day this is a very important part of the process don t start messing with it just because you want to see your work wait clean your workspace throw away the ink in your vessel the needle from the gun the gloves and the rest of the equipment that you used this stuff cannot be reused if you want to give yourself sterile clean and effective tattoos only use new clean products when you re giving a tattoo remove the bandage and gently clean the tattoo with water the first time you clean your tattoo use a small amount of cool water to gently clean the surface of the tattoo using your hand don t soak the tattoo or run it under water this is very important 15 x research source avoid soaking the tattoo for the first 48 hours of the job after the first rinse use soap and warm water to clean the tattoo gently that night before you go to bed after two days you can start cleaning it normally when you shower keep a thin layer of ointment on the tattoo 2 3 times a day for about two weeks keep a close eye on things to make sure there are no signs of infection and visit a medical professional immediately if you think your tattoo may be infected,Personal-Care-and-Style

try out your idea before committing to the design you can order a temporary custom tattoo online on a site like etsy or momentary ink submit your design online and the seller will make you a temporary tattoo 5 x research source you can also ask your tattoo artist if they can do a transfer of the design on your skin first ask for this during your initial design consultation narrow down potential artists visit the websites of local tattoo parlors and look at the portfolio of work of various artists in your area every tattoo artist will have their own individual style and you want to make sure that your needs align with the expertise of the artist 6 x research source ensure the artists are licensed licensing and certifications vary by state and you should only choose a tattoo artist who has a practitioner permit ask to see the license when you visit the tattoo parlor 7 x research source whittle down the artists by area of expertise for example if you know you want to get a portrait tattooed include in your list only artists who have experience in portraiture schedule a design consultation most tattoo parlors offer free consultations by appointment so use this as an opportunity to get to the know the artist and gauge whether you feel comfortable getting tattooed by them trust in the artist is of utmost importance when getting a tattoo since you want the artist to focus their full attention on you and not get easily distracted 8 x research source some artists may require a deposit for the consultation the money goes toward the time it takes the artist to create the design as well as the time they spend tattooing you ask the tattoo artist any questions you may have from pain factor to how many sessions your tattoo will require you want to choose an artist who is willing to patiently answer all of your questions after the visit reflect on how comfortable you felt at the parlor as well as on the artist s attitude think about whether the artist was enthusiastic and agreed with your vision for the tattoo and also consider the cleanliness of the parlor explain your vision it s important to go into a design consultation with a clear idea of the tattoo you would like to get or at least with a concept that you would like to bring to life otherwise it can be easy to be persuaded by what an artist might want to design and end up with a tattoo that wasn t really what you intended to get during the consultation show the artist your inspiration board sketches and your word diary find somebody who understands your vision and is willing to bring it to life the last thing you want is to be butting heads with an artist who doesn t share the same vision as you ideally you and the artist should collaborate to come up with a design that you love and they will enjoy creating if you can t come to an agreement find a different artist you don t want the artist to be unenthusiastic or hesitant about completing your tattoo decide where on the body you want the tattoo when choosing where to get inked you will want to consider visibility sensitivity and discretion this will set limitations such as size on your tattoo design think hard about whether you want the tattoo to be visible to everyone in which case you can consider tattooing your arms or legs or whether you want it to be more private in which case you would want to consider tattooing your lower back shoulders or stomach consider the pain factor a larger or more intricate tattoo made with different sizes of needles will also likely hurt more especially given that thicker needles tend to hurt more than thinner ones since they pierce more skin also keep in mind that different spots on the body have varying sensitivities bonier parts of the body and parts with little fat tend to be more painful the wrists for example are highly sensitive so it could hurt more to get inked there 9 x research source pain is subjective some claim that the initial outline of the tattoo is more painful especially if this is your first experience getting inked and others claim that the shading is more uncomfortable since the artist is going over the same areas over and over packing color or ink if you want to avoid shading however you should pick a simple minimalistic tattoo design 10 x research source pain is part of the process so prepare yourself remember that it s worth it you ll end up with a one of a kind tattoo decide what type of coloring you want tattoo color can affect the design you create color tattoos for example may be better suited for smaller designs so that you have fewer touch ups to do black and gray tattoos age better than color tattoos over time are typically less expensive and take less time to complete color tattoos allow for more creativity are great for covering existing tattoos and contrast strongly with light to medium skin tones ask your tattoo artist for their recommendation on the type of coloring you should get you might also want to consider getting a tattoo made out of white ink depending on the type of design that you want to create and on the visibility you want the tattoo to have white ink tattoos will often be less visible than monochrome or color ones 11 x research source,Personal-Care-and-Style
how to knock someone out,nowadays knowing a little self defense is a good idea most of the easiest self defense moves focus on throwing your attacker off and providing yourself chance to escape but there are also a few that can actually knock your attacker out if done right keep reading to learn how to perform some of these different moves,grab the attacker by the shirt use both hands to grab the attacker by the shirt at the center of the chest just below the collar or neckline the most effective way to headbutt someone is to draw them into a whiplash motion in order to accomplish this you need to push and pull the attacker away by the shirt avoid grabbing the attacker behind the neck natural instinct is to grab the attacker behind the neck and draw the head down for a headbutt but the problem with this is that the neck and shoulder muscles naturally tense when grabbed behind the neck making it much more difficult to pull the person forward push the attacker away use your full body weight to push forward into the attacker until their upper body leans back this movement causes the attacker to lose balance and causing their shoulders to disengage since this movement is also likely to be unexpected you will also have the element of surprise on your side quickly pull the attacker toward you as soon as the attacker s shoulders disengage use your arms to pull the attacker back toward your head with the shoulders disengaged in this manner the attacker s arms will naturally swing open preventing them from using the arms to block the headbutt swiftly strike with right or left of the crown of your head if you use the middle chances are you might crack your head as you draw the attacker toward you bring your head down so that the top of your head meets with the attacker s nose as their nose drops down strike with the top of your head do not use your forehead the nose is a sensitive pressure point and striking it with enough force will allow you to knock the other person out position yourself along the center line of your attacker stand directly in front of the attacker so that the vertical center of your body lines up with the vertical center of your attacker s body when performing an upper cut you will need to bring your arm up along this center line until you reach the attacker s chin as such you will need to be in a position where you have access to the center line of your attacker s body draw the eye with your non dominant hand use your non dominant hand to block and swipe at your attacker s block keep the hand near eye level so that it draws attention keeping this hand free allows you to defend yourself against your attacker s strikes and also causes your attacker to shift their attention away from your dominant hand swiftly bring an open hand up to the attacker s chin swing your dominant arm up along your attacker s center line with your fingers slightly bent exposing the heel of your palm the palm should face your attacker s face do not make a fist the heel of your hand is located just above the wrist and should be aimed at your attacker s chin strike with the palm heel of your hand strike just below the chin of your attacker snapping their head back and knocking them out striking the attacker here throws the head back and pinches the nerves at the top of the spinal column causing the attacker to black out using the palm of your hand gives you a greater surface area to work with in bare handed fighting it also protects your fingers thereby saving your hand and preventing damage to the one weapon you have access to in the fight assess the best way to strike depending on your position you can strike the nose of your attacker if they are in front of you or behind you but the movement you use will vary depending on your starting position 3 x research source if your attacker is in front of you you will need to move in a forward direction if your attacker is behind you you will need to attack as you turn to face them strike with the heel of your palm from the front when standing face to face with your attacker open your hand and strike straight forward hitting the base of the nose and shoving it back throw your weight into the attack in order to apply the most force this move causes your attacker s head to snap back pinching the nerves of the upper spinal column and if done with enough force causing the opponent to black out strike with your elbow if the attacker is behind you if the attacker is behind you bend and lift your arm so that your elbow points toward the attacker s face rotate your upper body enough to throw your elbow into the side of the attacker s nose the center side of the nose on either side is another pressure point of the body if you strike hard enough you can cause the nose to break and the attacker to fall unconscious align your side with your attacker s center line this technique works especially well when your attacker comes from the side but if your attacker is coming from a different angle you will need to rotate your stance until your shoulder roughly lines up with the vertical center of your attacker s body 4 x research source note that you can use either side of your body for this attack but you may be able to apply more force if you turn your body so that your dominant side faces your attacker step forward and shift your weight as your attacker approaches once your attacker comes toward you take a step forward with the foot nearest them causing your full body weight to shift forward onto that foot you need to step into your assailant s attack not draw back from it this move only works if your attacker is on the offensive and actively coming toward you it uses to force of the attacker s forward motion to inflict damage aim your elbow toward the adam s apple lift your elbow up as you step into your opponent s attack causing the elbow to meet the inside of the adam s apple on either side if you strike the inside of the adam s apple from a 45 degree angle you should be able to cause your attacker to to collapse even if you do not successfully strike the pressure point the force from the impact of your elbow should be enough to throw your attacker off begin in a protective stance stand with your feet shoulder width apart and your knees slightly bent your non dominant foot should be slightly in front of your dominant foot and your hands should be up and ready to move 5 x research source standing in this manner keeps your center of gravity at the center of your stance thereby allowing you to maintain perfect balance note that this move can still be performed even if you are not in a protective balanced stance but you will have greater odds of succeeding in a knockout if you start from this stance analyze your position in relation to the attacker the attacker should be crouched down and no greater than half a leg s length away you can bring your attacker down by delivering a knee to the groin or a sharp kick to the shin this move generally works best of your attacker is already doubled over and off guard it works less well if they are already facing you and attempting to rise force your attacker s shoulders down press down on both of your attacker s shoulders with the heel of your palms throw your entire upper body weight into the gesture so that you can apply maximum force keep your legs in the same stance to maintain your balance as you prepare to deliver the knockout blow swiftly bring your knee up as you draw your attacker down while holding your attacker s shoulders down bring your dominant knee forward so that it strikes your attacker in the nose or chin 6 x research source work quickly the force of being pushed down will automatically cause the attacker to tighten his or her shoulder muscles making it harder to keep the attacker down aim for either the nose or the chin to inflict the most damage and cause a black out,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to do a sleeper choke hold,the sleeper choke hold also known as the sleeper sleeper hold or rear naked choke is a submission move that is commonly used in martial arts as a submission technique it is also often taught as a self defense maneuver if you need to subdue an attacker a sleeper choke hold slows blood supply to the brain and causes the person being choked to pass out it is an incredibly dangerous move that should only be used in extreme situations or under the watch of a martial arts referee or expert always release someone the moment that they go limp and seek medical attention if they are unresponsive after you ve put them down,grab your opponent s shoulders or arm to anchor yourself if your opponent is trying to fight you grab their wrist with your nondominant hand and their upper shoulder with your dominant hand if you re wrestling your opponent quickly grab your opponent s shoulders and wrap your fingers around their shoulder blades to orient yourself you can perform a choke hold while you re squared up or standing off center to your opponent 1 x research source apply firm pressure with your hands after you ve grabbed them you will not be able to steady them for long without resistance the time that it takes to grab and rotate yourself should be less than 2 seconds you can drag your opponent to the ground to perform this hold or you can do it while the both of you are standing pull them while rotating their shoulders to get behind them if you ve grabbed your opponent s shoulders push them with your dominant hand at the same time pull with your nondominant hand this will spin your opponent around so that they re facing away from you wrap your dominant arm around their chest or neck to hold them in place if you grabbed their arm pull their wrist towards you and shuffle to the side before sliding your dominant arm around their chest to spin them around 2 x research source if you re smaller or they re resisting your hold you can place your inside leg behind them and pivot to move behind them if you re actively being attacked and you ve grabbed their wrist twist their wrist inwards as you pull them to disarm them yank them towards you and wrap your dominant arm around their neck once you re behind your opponent your dominant arm should be wrapped around their chest pull your opponent close to you and adjust your dominant forearm so that it s around their neck your opponent will raise their arms to protect their neck this will give you the opening you need to place your nondominant hand behind their head 3 x research source when they reach up to protect their neck your first instinct may be to reach your free hand out to swat their hands do not do this you will lose your leverage if you don t place your arm behind their head if you re being actively attacked yank them from side to side while setting your grip up to disorient them and make it harder to fight back when your opponent raises their arms to protect their neck they ll probably wrap their hands around your forearm and try to pull it off grab their shoulder and grip tightly to keep them from ripping your arm off slide your dominant forearm under their chin and wrap their neck adjust your dominant arm by raising it up until your forearm is lodged firmly between their chin and chest wrap your arm tightly around their neck to hold them in place grab their shoulder with your dominant hand to stabilize your grip 4 x research source do not yank them side to side once your arm is under their neck you could damage your opponent s spine permanently slide your nondominant hand behind their head run your nondominant hand behind the back of your opponent s head in between the neck and the center of their head bring your nondominant thumb up to your ear on the opposite side of your body 5 x research source for example if you are right handed you will lift your left arm behind their head and bring your left thumb up to your right ear loop your dominant hand under your arm to lock your grip to stabilize your grip thread your dominant hand inside the fold of your nondominant elbow wrap your fingers around your elbow to lock your dominant arm in place this way if your opponent tries to slide out you can use the tension from your grip to easily increase pressure 6 x research source this will give your dominant hand something to hold on to if you don t grip your arm you re relying on the strength of your arm alone to keep them grappled apply pressure to the sides of your opponent s neck with your dominant arm bend your elbow and flex your dominant arm so that your forearm is applying pressure to one side of their neck and your bicep is applying pressure to the opposite side push your nondominant arm forward to tilt their neck forward towards their chest this will press their chin into your forearm and provide additional pressure so that you can begin restricting blood flow to their brain 7 x research source lean back and spread your feet out as you re applying pressure to brace for resistance the goal of a sleeper hold is not to restrict air if you re pushing down on your opponent s throat you re not doing it correctly turn your hips to shove your pelvis into your opponent s back once you have a firm grip on your opponent and you re applying pressure rotate your trunk so that your hip is pressing into the small of your opponent s back this will keep them angled away from you and will make it harder for them to fight back or get out of the hold 8 x research source which hip you use to brace your opponent s back depends on how big your opponent is do whatever feels natural to you if your opponent is bigger use your dominant hip if they re smaller use your nondominant hip hold this position for 10 seconds or until your opponent goes limp or taps out perform a side hold if you can only wrap around one side you can perform a variation on the choke hold if your opponent misses a punch with their arm extended slide under their shoulder and wrap your dominant hand around the side of their neck on the opposite side lift up to keep their extended arm from lowering and grab your dominant hand with your free hand to wrap around them and squeeze 9 x research source tilt towards them to keep them off balance this will only restrict blood flow to one side of their neck this move is not the preferred method since it doesn t prevent your opponent from using their nondominant arm release your choke hold after 10 seconds unless you re in immediate danger unless you re actively being attacked release your choke hold after 10 seconds 15 seconds is the maximum amount of time that you can apply pressure to the neck without risking permanent damage 10 x research source if you ve correctly applied pressure to the neck s major arteries your opponent should go limp after 5 9 seconds don t restrict your opponent s airflow and only apply pressure to the arteries if you apply too much pressure to your opponent s throat you run the risk of damaging their windpipe the goal of a sleeper hold is to restrict blood flow not air so only use force on the sides of your opponent s neck 11 x research source stop choking your opponent if they tap on your forearm the universal sign of surrender in martial combat is a light double tap on an exposed section of your skin this means that your opponent is giving up release your grip immediately if your opponent taps on your forearm while you re choking them 12 x research source you will see mixed martial artists do this when they ve been placed in a submission hold that they can t get out of this is where the term tap out comes from avoid using the choke hold on someone with cardiovascular issues the sleeper choke hold restricts blood flow to the brain this means that individuals with heart or blood pressure problems can suffer a serious cardiac event if their blood flow is disrupted never perform this move on someone struggling with cardiovascular problems 13 x research source call emergency services immediately if someone suffers a cardiovascular attack while you re choking them or they don t wake up after 10 15 seconds,Personal-Care-and-Style

defensive tool protecting your face neck and torso against an attacker at all costs 3 x research source make your body as small as possible by bringing your shoulders in and ducking your head extending your knife holding arm in front of you flexed at a 45 degree angle don t extend your knife arm all the way which will leave it vulnerable to attack use your other arm to guard your chest neck and stomach as you hide behind your knife you don t want to offer your unarmed hand as some kind of shield or guard put your knife forward always 4 x research source move constantly if you both draw knives take a big step backward but remain facing your opponent at all times your knife between your body and your opponent imagine there was a magnet pointing your knife at your opponent s knife in general you can move one of four directions forward backward and circling right or left you should always be moving in some direction to protect yourself and make it more difficult to be struck never stand flat footed use your knife as a distraction most attackers won t be interested in actually attacking you especially if you just pulled a knife that you look like you know how to use nobody wants to actually get into a knife fight if someone has pulled a knife on you and you ve pulled a knife in return that should hopefully be the end of it ideally pulling your knife and distracting your opponent should be the end of the fight 5 x research source draw your knife and issue a warning something like this is a buck knife given to me by my tactical knife instructor who works for blackwater i sharpen it every night trust me you don t want to come anywhere closer let s just call it a night keith richards a famous knife enthusiast liked to say that the only purpose of pulling a knife was to get someone to look at the knife as a distraction before you ended the fighting by kicking them between the legs not the worst idea parry by dodging and controlling your opponent s striking arm knife fighting doesn t much resemble sword fighting you won t bang blades or do much parrying in a knife fight but it s still important to deflect what could be a devastating blow by sidestepping blows turning 90 degrees to the outside of your opponent s striking arm then using your other hand to grip your opponent s elbow and attempt to disarm them it s always preferable to use your knife to strike or block at your opponent s arm rather than attempting to grab at them if there s no other option you do need to block with your other arm to protect your vital organs a cut even a severe one on your arm is preferable to a stab wound in your solar plexus read the next section for more information about defensive striking to disarm your opponent always avoid fights if possible pulling and using your knife should be an absolute last resort only taken if your life is being threatened if you can avoid the confrontation entirely or run do this instead and avoid a potentially lethal situation if you receive a bad cut or stab wound put pressure on the wound immediately to attempt to stop the bleeding and seek medical attention maintain consistent pressure on the wound until you can get professional care back out of striking range a knife fight isn t about getting in close it s about staying out of the way most of the fight will be you ducking and dodging waiting for your moments to strike with quick little disarming strikes that will end the fight for good if it looks like you re going to actually be attacked by someone with a knife take a full step backward take a minute to evaluate your surroundings and move to open space you need to be able to move backward with ease if you re in cramped surroundings it s going to be difficult to defend yourself attempt to disarm your attacker most inexperienced goons will take a wild slash somewhere close to your face which should give you the first opportunity to stop the fight quickly when they make this mistake when your opponent strikes your counter strike should be swift accurate and should end the fight immediately if they slash low toward your stomach move with them taking a big step back and to the side as their arm is extended bring your knife over their forearm point down and slash down with your blade at the wrist attempting to get them to drop the knife if they slash high move with them taking a big step back and to the side then slash with your blade pointing up at the underside of their forearm aim for the forearm and wrist area attempting to get them to drop the knife never use your other arm as a shield it s a common misconception that you want to block with your other arm getting your opponent s knife out of the way and then move in close for a strike it seems to make sense but one or two slashes at your blocking arm with an attacker s knife will have you losing blood and close to being incapacitated very quickly making your moving in an unlikely proposition instead you need to learn to use your knife to block and strike in single maneuvers if you see an opportunity to grab your opponent s wrist with your opposite hand that s another story and you may want to take it obviously if there s a situation that s extremely dire you may need to offer up a sacrifice arm to protect your head and throat but as your marker exercises suggest it s going to get ugly really quickly you need to be fast with your disarming strikes and not get into something with more contact never throw your knife the absolute last thing you want to do in a one on one knife fight is lose your knife defending yourself against an attacker with a knife when you don t have one is extremely difficult as your marker exercise should have suggested actually striking someone with a thrown knife is extremely unlikely and you re most likely to just lose your knife and end up in trouble keep your knife in your hand at all times,Personal-Care-and-Style

other person present give them absolutely no reaction whatsoever even if your enemy is standing two feet away from you shouting your name just ignore them and talk to a friend as if nothing were happening find safety in a group there s an old adage about enemies that s true the enemy of your enemy is your friend it s likely that your enemy s alienated more people than just you find other

buds to hang out with though you can deflect a single bully easily by turning the numbers back on them prank your enemy under certain circumstances a proper prank may be the best way to get back your enemy this is especially true with particularly prideful or egotistical enemies who might do well to get knocked down a peg or two some common enemy revenging pranks might include 7 x research source hacking into your enemy s email to send compromising list serv messages that will embarrass your enemy order something embarrassing to have delivered to your enemy at the office a big box full of old pro wrestling magazines or adult diaper catalogs or strange and exotic pornography to the workplace make sure to have it deliver to the building not to your office suite so the delivery person will have to wander around to all the offices and find your tormentor personally go crude poop in a paper bag on your enemy s doorstep jolly ranchers in the shower faucet an upper decker in the toilet tank you be the judge of how far is too far move on the best revenge living well the best way to get a bully out of your life is to move past it and put them in the rear window ignore your bully freeze out

t look for a fight but learn to defend yourself if necessary you should never let your enemy provoke you into a physical altercation but some enemies are set in their ways and force your hand you ll be able to be much more confident in your ability to move through your day to day if you know you ll be able to handle any situation that arises don t move around in fear get prepared 8 x research source learn to throw a punch fights don t work like in the movies where both people throw a million hard right hands right to the face until someone hits a ko most fights are over very quickly learning to properly form and throw a punch will make sure that you don t make a valuable movie mistake if the situation calls for it so you ll be able to throw a high probability punch accurately and end the fight sooner rather than later 9 x research source make a fist by wrapping your fingers into your hand firmly but not so tight you cut off the circulation wrap your thumb around the bottom of your knuckles not around your index finger and not inside your fingers extend the middle knuckle of your middle finger slightly this is where your fist should make contact not your big knuckle where your fingers connect to your hands punch in a straight line keeping your elbows in and throwing linear punches not big circular haymakers there s a lot more power in a straight jab than in a big swing aim for the nose the neck or the stomach punching someone in the jaw cheek or forehead will end up hurting you more aim for soft spots and swing hard learn to play defense keeping a good defensive position is just as important as throwing a solid punch if not more important remember it s not a rocky movie a couple solid punches into your kisser and you re going to be on the ground which is exactly where you don t want to be hold your fists loosely formed up near your face and shift your weight so your shoulder and hip on your dominant side are pointed at your opponent don t square up to your opponent but turn to one side to make a smaller target keep your hands up near your chin and the side of your head at all times when you re not swinging move forward not back as you punch go straight in toward your opponent holding your defensive posture and make it your goal to knock them down the best way to do this is to look as big as possible and advance advance advance don t let yourself get pushed backward while it may seem unbelievable and will go against your natural instinct it s much safer and less painful to move into punches instead of backing away from them keep moving forward and getting your enemy to retreat rather than stepping back if you have to take a hit meeting it halfway before it s reached its full power will hurt less than at the apex of the swing where you re more likely to get knocked down move forward and get your enemy to shift back keep moving stick and move say the boxers if you find yourself in a fight don t just stand there lead footed unless you want to get your block knocked off stand on the balls of your feet bouncing slightly and moving your head back and forth as if you were dodging a pesky bee flying at you through the air make your head a moving target and you ll be tough to hit stay on your feet try not to fall down under any circumstances or take the fight to the ground standing up for yourself with a quick fist fight is sometimes the best way to deal with a tough situation if your enemy pushes you into it but a fight that ends up wrestling around on the ground is dangerous and should be avoided at all costs if you knock your opponent down back off say this is over and walk away you ll have proven your point look for the quickest way to escape end a fight as quickly as possible by looking for an exit if you knock your opponent down with a well timed punch don t give them the opportunity to get madder and come up swinging just say look i m done with this i don t want to fight you you started this and i m finishing it then make a quick exit and go out on a high note with any luck your enemy should be vanquished again fights should always be the last resort to dealing with your enemy and should be avoided at all costs,Personal-Care-and-Style
how to beat a tough person in a fight,sometimes you may find yourself in situations where you can t avoid a physical altercation in general a tough person as anyone who is bigger and or stronger than you many people looking to pick a fight target anyone who they perceive as weaker than they are so it s likely that you ll face an opponent with a physical advantage luckily there are a few ways you can even the odds whether you ve been jumped on the street or challenged by a rival,make the first move don t ever wait for someone to attack first if you sense an impending attack hit first and hit hard this will surprise your attacker and help to level the playing field 1 x research source consider the legal consequences of your actions you must be absolutely sure you are in danger and there is no way of escaping before you strike a would be attacker otherwise you cannot justify your actions as self defense and the other person may win a civil suit against you 2 x research source go for the eyes try to jab at your attacker s eyes with your fingers not only is this painful but the reflex to cover the eyes is often incredibly strong this may give you an opening to land a serious blow or possibly cause your attacker to drop a weapon the best technique is to grab your opponent by his or her ear and press your thumb across the entire nearby eye push down forcefully this move is much more painful than a simple poke to the eye and may buy you enough time to get away 3 x research source lash out at the nose or shins when attacked from behind attackers often jump their victims from behind to surprise them turn this disadvantage around and use it to forcefully attack your opponent s weakest areas these techniques are especially helpful for getting out of an attacker s grip throw your head back to bash the nose with a head butt your skull is a lot denser than the cartilage of your attacker s nose and can do a surprising amount of damage aim for the bridge as a blow to it will be the most painful rake your foot forcefully along your attacker s shin bone this is an especially good option if you are wearing high heels alternatively you can simply try to kick backwards against his or her shins while less painful than a hit to the nose a shin kick is much easier to land 4 x research source focus your blows on other pressure points strike out at the especially vulnerable parts of your opponent which include the eyes ears temple nose chin throat neck and groin 5 x research source if you can land a solid hit there are a few ways of incapacitating an opponent an uppercut to the jaw under the chin will twist the head quickly potentially causing a loss of consciousness 6 x research source a jab to the temple is the most surefire way to knock someone out this spot is very vulnerable and can easily cause internal bleeding keep in mind that this type of blow can seriously injure or even kill the other person 7 x research source protect your own vulnerable areas remember that your opponent can also target your own pressure points pay close attention and don t let your attacker s hands get anywhere near your face and neck 8 x research source keep moving above all you shouldn t let your attacker touch you don t stand still move from side to side as erratically as possible to confuse your opponent avoiding the attacker s blows should take priority over getting in your own every time your attacker missteps or fails to land a punch is a potential opportunity for you to run 9 x research source use any available object as a weapon if you carry pepper spray a knife or a palm stick strike with those if you don t do your best to improvise anything hard and or sharp can work from a car key to a nearby rock high heels are an especially good choice for an improvised weapon if you can pull them off your feet to give yourself more maneuverability 10 x research source if the fight is taking place on sand soil or gravel grab a handful and throw it at your attacker s face if you manage to get grit in your attacker s eye it will temporarily blind him or her you will have time to get away while your attacker attempts to clear his or her vision a sturdy flashlight makes for a great improvised weapon at night shine it directly into your opponent s eyes to blind and distract giving you an edge if that isn t enough to get away turn the flashlight around and hit with it 11 x research source pull on long hair if your attacker has long hair try to yank it as hard as you can this can cause pain by itself but it also allows you to move your attacker into a better position to land a knockout blow if your attacker wears his or her hair in a ponytail or large braid it will be easier to grab and hold on to get away when you get the opportunity no matter what you should always leave the area as soon as the fight is over if your attacker flees he or she may come back with a deadly weapon or a few friends in tow you also need to keep in mind that self defense is only legally justified when using reasonable force in the face of inescapable immediate danger if your opponent is on the ground you are no longer in danger and should have the opportunity to run if you strike an incapacitated foe you open yourself up to a civil suit even if that person attacked you 12 x research source prioritize evasion under most circumstances avoiding strikes is a fundamental aspect of fighting evasion becomes even more important when facing a bigger or stronger opponent in a clean fight a tough fighter will have the advantage of power and may hit you hard enough to end the fight quickly make sure to be quick on your feet and move away from incoming blows use tai sabaki tai sabaki are a set of movements found in japanese martial arts fighters use tai sabaki to avoid incoming strikes while putting themselves in the best position to launch a counterattack when fighting a bigger opponent counters are your best option to gain the upper hand two basic tai sabaki movements are nagashi this simple move is best used to counter an unexpected frontal attack from a forward facing stance use your left leg as a pivot and slide your left behind you in an arc your body should swing like an opening door as you put your foot into position raise your arm to strike hiraki this step is best for an unexpected attack from a short distance from a forward facing stance slide your foot furthest from your opponent towards the same direction slide your other foot closer to the first then turn your second foot towards your opponent as you move your feet turn your hips towards your opponent and raise your arms to strike lean back when kicked if you re fighting with a style involving kicks such as muay thai the most effective technique you can use against a taller fighter is to lean back to evade their higher kicks when your opponent s kick flies over your head you will be in a good position to strike back as he or she is momentarily thrown off balance 13 x research source neutralize your opponent s reach advantage another advantage a taller fighter has is a longer reach there will be a zone between the two of you where your opponent will be able to land hits while you can t it s important to stay out of this area spend as much time as possible either far enough away that your opponent can t hit or close enough that you can too when moving between these two zones be sure to keep your defenses up 14 x research source establish a clear set of rules before you begin if your opponent uses dirty tricks there s no reason why you should hold back when in a planned fight you and your opponent should come to a mutual agreement of what is and isn t allowed in the fight you can also get an impartial third party to help lay down the rules and act as a kind of referee for the fight make a fist correctly before you even think about throwing your first punch you need to have a perfect fist curl your fingers inward onto your palm and make sure your thumb is on the outside folded across the bottom knuckles of your first few fingers 15 x research source if your thumb is on the inside of your fist you are likely to break it prevent your opponent from landing hits unlike a street fight letting your foe make the first move is a reasonable strategy make sure to avoid every strike you can and spring back with a counterattack it s important that you keep your body in motion making punches difficult to land a proper fighting stance will also make you harder to hit by creating a smaller target instead of facing your opponent head on with your shoulders in parallel stand to the side with your dominant half forward minimize the damage of blows you can t avoid you won t be able to dodge every punch for the hits you have to take absorb the shock as best as you can to make them less effective when taking a body blow brace for impact by tightening your abdominal muscles shift your torso so that your opponent s fist lands at your abdominal muscles to the side rather than at the center near internal organs for blows to the head flex your neck and jaw muscles and lean into the punch make sure the hit lands on your forehead which is incredibly tough above all never let a strike land at your temple jaw or nose 16 x research source avoid dirty tricks and potentially lethal techniques although it s not generally acknowledged there is an unspoken rule between men that strikes to the groin aren t acceptable in fair fights it s considered to be a dirty trick along with other actions like eye gouging and hair pulling if you come out on top with these methods your friends are unlikely to consider it a legitimate win weapons should also be off limits unless they are agreed upon beforehand while blows to the face head and neck are legitimate in fair fights it s best to avoid using them outside of officially sanctioned matches an uppercut to the jaw or a jab to the temple can win you a fight quickly but these strikes can also cause permanent brain damage without medical personnel ready to assist a downed fighter you should reconsider using such techniques,Personal-Care-and-Style
how to deal with a threat,you may encounter many types of threat over the course of your life some threats are urgent immediate and violent other threats are non immediate but just as potentially harmful evaluate the decision and figure out what you need to do to keep yourself safe act quickly calmly and rationally,gauge the urgency of the threat decide how certain you are that the threatening person will follow through on his or her words there is a wide margin between a threatening note and a man standing in front of you holding a knife the way that you react will necessarily depend upon the immediate danger of the situation evaluate the situation if the threat is immediate then quickly and calmly look around you for potential defenses and escape routes if the threat is more abstract then try to get a clearer picture of what exactly is going on make sure that you understand why you re being threatened and what the actual risk is 1 x research source why are you being threatened if you don t know ask if you can t ask then speculate do they want something from you consider giving a threatening person what he she asks for you never know how desperate someone is and it is senseless to be killed over the contents of your wallet who is the leader of the group if it comes down to you against them then the leader may be your first target assess the area are you familiar with the lay of the land are you under cctv surveillance do you have a chance of escape this will strongly define the actions that you take to deal with the situation talk to the person if you personally know the person who is threatening you see if there s a way to resolve the situation without escalating it any further strike a deal if you re being blackmailed or asked for something discuss the situation face to face and try to come to a mutual agreement 2 x research source figure out whether you re being threatened for something valid perhaps the person thinks that you did something that you didn t do don t be too proud to apologize a good apology can defuse some of the tensest situations deal with blackmail blackmail is still a threat even if it is nonviolent the way that you respond will depend upon what the person is holding over you and how much you have to lose make sure that you don t give in before you ve considered other ways out if you feel confident take a stand 3 x research source tell someone make sure that you aren t dealing with this alone as soon as possible involve someone that you trust a teacher a parent a friend a partner a coworker an authority figure together you stand a better chance show the person any threatening messages and make sure that he she knows exactly who is threatening you 4 x research source get a restraining order if there is no other way to defuse the threat then consider obtaining a court order for the person to stop bothering you you ll need to prove the truth and urgency of the threat and file a report with the local police department you can ask for an order for the person to stop specific behaviors or you can ask that the courts restrict the person from coming near you once you have a stay away order against a person he or she cannot come within a certain physical range of you often on the order of 50 100 yards this may not stop the threat if the person is desperate enough but it will at least create a legal barrier 5 x research source act nonviolently when possible try to handle the threat by giving in or escaping or talking your way out of the situation you may find that people are much more reasonable than you expect decide whether you have an escape route if they are only facing you then you might run backwards run towards other people there is safety in numbers if there is no nonviolent way to escape then you may need to defend yourself be prepared for this but try not to make it your first reaction defend yourself be realistic about your chances if you are outnumbered or otherwise outmatched then it might be wise to first explore nonviolent solutions remember that violence is never a guaranteed method of dealing with someone once you escalate the situation it may be very difficult to safely cool it back down 6 x research source if you are under cctv surveillance and you plan to fight your way out of the situation then you want the threatening person to make the first move however if you are outnumbered and one or more of them is armed in some visible way then this may be enough to justify your actions take down the leader try a kick to the groin an elbow to the ribs or a well placed punch no points for style or fair play but if you put all your strength into it he she should hit the deck fast now you need to think again run now if possible move quickly away through the space you just created if you re lucky the rest of the group will be momentarily distracted if you can t get away then you need to get something in between you and the rest of the group one of the group will do nicely grab the closest one by the throat or neck you want to be behind him so he is not in a good position and make sure that you are hurting him enough that he won t attack you try grabbing his ear with your other arm and pulling it as hard as you can fight for it keep the fighting close and dirty dart in and out again and don t let them grab you you re finished once one or two of them catch hold of you run as soon as you get an opening kick the back of your shield s knees down to the floor in a very powerful stamp ideally you want to break something you then need to deal with the others in a similar way try to go for unexpected targets the knee is very weak and can easily be broken with a kick sucker punches to the jaw can lay someone out but they are so very expected that it s unlikely to come off contact the authorities tell the police or a security guard about the confrontation alternatively use your cellphone or a payphone and call the emergency services do your best to accurately describe the situation when where and what the threatening people looked like 7 x research source,Personal-Care-and-Style
how to throw a knife,throwing knives as the name suggests a knife which is designed to throw efficiently these knives are not too light balanced in the middle and really sturdy so they don t break easily 1 x research source different knife throwing techniques have been adopted by many cultures around the world with different shapes and sizes,choose your knife there are three different kinds of knives that are good for throwing blade heavy handle heavy and balanced knives balanced knives are generally best for beginners as they make switching to other models easier keep in mind that you want the weight to be thrown first if you are throwing a blade heavy knife you will want your blade to be thrown first hold the knife by the handle to throw it and vice versa if you re throwing a handle heavy knife you will throw it by the blade grip the knife with your dominant hand though knife throwers often develop their own gripping styles with time and experience there are three conventional gripping methods that beginners usually choose from depending on their knife style and or personal preferences note that a firm but delicate hold is necessary for all gripping styles too much grip will hamper your release whereas too little might cause the knife to fly out of your hand prematurely potentially hurting someone 2 x research source hammer grip grip the handle of the knife as you would the handle of a hammer place the handle across your open palm near your knuckles wrap your four fingers underneath and around the handle and place your thumb over the top this grip is especially useful if you re learning to throw a double edged blade pinch grip for a single edged blade hold your palm out in front of you and move your thumb to create a crease between the fleshy pad of your thumb and the rest of your palm with the handle pointing away from you place the blunt edge of the knife blade into this crease so that the tip lines up with the bottom of your thumb crease place your thumb along one side of the blade and all your fingers except the pinky along the other side thereby pinching the blade without pressing against the point or the sharpened edge pinch grip for a double edged blade with the handle pointing away from you grasp the tip of the knife so that the tip of your thumb is one side of the blade and the tips of all your fingers except the pinky are on the other side thereby pinching it without pressing against the point or either sharpened edge note that hold will not allow for a powerful throw if you are just learning to use a double edged knife you may have better luck with the hammer grip angle the knife how you do this will change how rapidly the knife flips through the air which must be adjusted depending on the distance between you and your target note that these distances are somewhat subjective a knife held by its handle will need to turn over at least once in the air to land point first whereas a knife held by its point will need to turn over at least one and a half times therefore adjust the angle of your hold depending on how your knife performs for you with your chosen grip and distance close range bend your wrist back toward your forearm this will allow the knife to turn over in the air more quickly which is necessary because there is so little distance between you and your target medium range slightly bend your wrist back toward your forearm this will somewhat increase the speed with which the knife turns over in the air which is necessary because there isn t a lot of space between you and your target long range keep your wrist unbent this will keep the knife from turning over too much in the air which is necessary because there is plenty of distance between you and your target choose a target it is important to use targets that are thick enough that the knife won t go through them but soft enough that the knives will slide easily into them for target practice use cardboard or cereal boxes these are great for determining accuracy more established knife throwers prefer a soft wood such as willow birch or pine it helps to count your paces away from the target assuming it is stationary so that you get a feel for how hard you have to throw the knife and can use the distance for a reference your targets can be hanging mounted or free standing assume the proper stance place your weight on your dominant leg rest your non dominant foot in front of you with no weight on it raise your dominant arm in front of you so that it is perpendicular to the ground and bend at the elbow so that the knife is raised alongside your head keep the knife a comfortable distance from your head so that you do not cut yourself when you swing to throw it 3 x research source swing the knife forward shift your weight from your dominant to your non dominant leg to create forward momentum at the same time swing your forearm forward from the elbow so that your arm is straight out in front of you this is the point at which you will release the knife practice this swinging motion several times to get the hang of it resist the urge to throw the knife like a baseball when you do this your arm swings across your body whereas in knife throwing the goal is to swing your arm straight up and down so that the knife doesn t hit at an angle to curb this cross swinging tendency it may help to pretend you are chopping wood if you have angled the knife upwards bring your wrist straight as you finish the swing release the knife and follow through simply allow the knife to slip from your hand once your arm is pointing toward your target and your wrist is perfectly straight your entire body will end up angled slightly forward due to the weight shift and your arm will continue swinging downwards a well timed release will cause the knife to fly out of your hand and stick into the target horizontally knife throwing is more about finesse than strength it is most important to keep the entire movement fluid and only apply as much force as is needed once you get the hang of it you will be amazed at how little force is needed assess what needs to be changed to throw the knife perfectly if you find that you hit the target with the butt of the knife instead of the blade and changing the angle of your wrist isn t enough to compensate adjust one pace forward or backward do not change the amount of force applied in your throw you simply need to allow for more or less rotation a good rule of thumb is that one pace equals a half rotation of the knife as always heavier objects will require more force to propel them at the desired speed over the required distance instead of increasing the strength of your throw beyond the point of losing fluidity and control you might consider aiming for a point slightly above your intended target when throwing with larger heavier knives clean the blade after throwing after completing a practice session always clean the blade of the knife oils from your hand can degrade the metal in the blade and cause it to rust it is also important to clean your knife if your target was something such as a piece of meat that could produce oils that could harm the blade,Personal-Care-and-Style

treatment claims otherwise never immerse a leather jacket in water or place it in a washing machine apply leather conditioner occasionally rubbing in leather conditioner restores oil to the leather preventing excessive dryness and cracking but too much oil can clog the pores and affect the jacket s color or longevity only apply leather conditioner when the jacket starts to feel dry or stiff here are some tips for choosing a product check the label to make sure it is suitable for your type of leather this is mostly important for suede or nubuck jackets ideally use pure mink oil neatsfoot oil or other natural animal oils but be aware that this may darken the leather 2 x research source products that contain wax or silicone can dry out the leather but may be a cheaper option that causes less of a color change 3 x research source use sparingly never use products that contain mineral oil or petroleum which can cause significant damage 4 x research source also avoid saddle soap at least on unfinished leather without a protective water resistant coating 5 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments

lowest setting often labeled rayon place the leather under a cloth and iron the cloth quickly and briefly 8 x research source see the section on storage for more detailed information read the tag for specific instructions almost all leather jackets sold in stores include a tag describing how to clean the jacket because there are many varieties of leather not all of them distinguishable to the naked eye follow the specific instructions on the label whenever possible 9 x research source the steps below are generally safe if followed thoroughly but no method is guaranteed to work safely on all leather dust the jacket with a gentle brush or cloth if your leather jacket has been left in the closet for a while it may need dusting to avoid scuffing or damaging the leather use a dry cotton cloth nubuck cloth or camel hair brush 10 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source 11 x research source clean finished leather with a damp cloth test your jacket first by dropping a single drop of water onto it if the water stays on the surface it is safe to wipe dirt from the leather using a slightly damp cloth 12 x research source if the water is absorbed and darkens the leather do not apply water clean suede with a specialized brush or a dry sponge suede brushes can remove light grime from suede but may scratch other leather materials you can try using a dry sponge as a cheaper option do not use this method on non suede leather or on unidentified leather this may work best if you first hang the suede in a steamy bathroom do not apply steam directly to the suede with an iron or kettle as heat can cause damage 13 x research source rub an art gum eraser over grime this method works well on suede but test other leathers in a hidden area before use rub the art gum eraser over the grimy or dirty area to detach the dirt or fresh ink stains from a suede jacket if the eraser residue clings to the jacket remove it with a gentle vacuum cleaner or compressed air 14 x trustworthy source us national park service agency responsible for the maintenance and promotion of national parks and monuments go to source this type of eraser is sometimes sold as artist s eraser and is available at crafts stores it is a putty like substance which crumbles apart when used don t confuse it with kneaded erasers which look similar but does not crumble select leather cleaning products cautiously only use a leather cleaning product that matches your type of leather ideally one manufactured by the same company that made your jacket always test any cleaning product on a hidden area of the leather to test for discoloration or damage leaving the product on for at least five minutes then wiping it off with a clean cloth if no harm has occurred treat the affected part of the jacket according to the product s instructions suede or nubuck should be treated only by products specifically made for those types leather labeled as aniline semi aniline or pigmented leather might be cleaned by a general purpose leather cleaner but always test on a hidden area first you can purchase ink stain remover for leather but this is not usually 100 effective if the ink has dried 15 x research source remove mold with rubbing alcohol or mild soap if a leather jacket is covered in mold which usually appears as a white or grey fuzz mix equal parts water and rubbing alcohol gently wipe off the mold using a cotton cloth dampened with this solution if that is unsuccessful try a mild

discoloration 17 x research source heat can cause dryness and cracking so store the jacket in a cool location away from heating vents and other heat sources make sure the leather can breathe leather will last longer if exposed to dry air especially a light draft never store leather inside a plastic bag or underneath plastic sheeting when storing leather in a bag temporarily open the bag whenever convenient to expose it to the air 18 x research source storing your jacket inside a closet is fine unless the closet is unusually hot or damp keep leather away from pesticides leather can absorb insecticides if this occurs it may not be possible to remove the smell or even the toxin from the jacket in addition mothballs and similar home pesticides are most effective in small containers which

if you have a regular tattoo artist open up a dialogue about home kits artists who operate out of tattoo shops often have worked from home at some point they can offer valuable input some professionals may even be willing to give you a tutorial on setting up the machine for a fee sanitize your hands tattoo machines need to be treated with the utmost care take precaution before handling these machines wash your hands with antibacterial soap or wear latex gloves familiarize yourself with the machine the frame holds all the pieces together then you have 2 electromagnetic coils which provide the power for the machine the coils rapidly move the armature bar which is connected to a barred needle the power supply connects to the electromagnetic coils all of these components can be removed or replaced as needed assemble the barrel inspect the grip of the machine there are 2 sides of the grip for the tube and the machine s tip set these to the preferable length and tighten the 2 screws on the grip on average the needle shouldn t exceed the tip more than 2 mm and no less than 1 mm if there is excessive blood then your needle is too long 2 x research source set up the needle take a look at the needles you received with the machine you should have a few different types and sizes of needles install one of the needles by inserting it through the tube towards the tip be careful not to dull a needle while assembling this could lead to a painful tattoo for example rl round liner rs round shader m1 magnum 1 layer m2 double magnum rm round magnum and f flat are all different kinds of needles the numbers indicate the size and tell how many needles there are secure the nipple the nipple also known as a grommet secures the needle and grip to the machine s base place a nipple on the armature bar pin fasten the needle s round open end onto the nipple adjust the needle once you ve assembled the tube you need to adjust the length of how much the needle is exposed you can adjust the needle s exposure by adjusting the tube vise the tube vise is the adjustable screw in between the armature and needle choose a power supply power supplies vary in specifications and voltages some starter kits come equipped with a power supply that isn t adjustable you can replace this with a different one if desired your power supply shouldn t cost more than the tattoo machine power supplies with analog or digital displays allow you to adjust the settings examine the power supply check the fuse make sure you are running the proper voltage into your machine most tattoo power supplies will have a regulated control for the amount of fuse and power going into your tattoo machine some of the cheaper models don t have this feature acquire a footswitch and a clip cord if your power supply doesn t come with a footswitch you ll need to buy one a footswitch is fairly inexpensive and doesn t require a major setup you ll also need a clip cord to attach the tattoo machine to the power supply connect your footswitch attach your footswitch to the the power supply the footswitch activates and regulates the power from the power supply to the needle similar to a sewing peddle 3 x research source connect the machine to the power supply there is a clear location at the bottom of the machine for the clip cord to connect the machine to the power supply there should only be 2 inputs on the power supply itself make sure you connect the cables in their proper location test the machine once everything is connected and assembled you re ready to test the machine if you are worried about testing the tattoo machine on yourself just turn everything on and examine it the needle should vibrate at a consistent speed without stopping upon pressing the footswitch practice on fruit a good way to practice your art is by practicing on apples or pears the skin on apples and pears are similar to the human flesh if your fruits become damaged then you re puncturing the needle too deep 4 x research source,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to look entirely emotionless,it can be a big advantage to be able to appear completely emotionless controlling your emotions can help you gain control of negotiations avoid confrontations and even seem cool while it may seem like it is easy enough to hide your feelings it takes a lot of practice to look entirely emotionless you have to learn to fully control your expressions your movements and your words all at the same time,relax your eyes and mouth the eyes and mouth can express a multitude of emotions it is important to keep control over them at all times the best way to do this is by

emotional reaction just look at the person the same way you would look at a chair or a wall watch your movements subtle gestures can be very expressive even if we are not always consciously aware of them this is usually the most difficult part of looking emotionless and no matter how hard you try there is still going to be some small gesture that tells something about how you feel avoid any fidgeting such as cracking your knuckles or biting your fingernails do not show any hints that you are tired by rubbing your eyes or yawning tapping your feet can make you seem nervous looking down

answered with facts your best bet is to avoid the question by asking a question back you can also try giving a vague or ambiguous response keep an even tone watch the pace and pitch of your words raising your pitch can be an indication of excitement or agitation dropping your pitch and speaking more slowly can seem like you re uncertain or upset try to speak as though you are reading an instruction manual out loud dull informative and without originality will go a long way to keeping your conversations low key don t use emotional words many words express emotions some are very obvious while others express more subtle emotions while it s obvious you don t want to say you re sad or happy you also should not say you re determined calm or indecisive these words express just as much of your emotional state avoid using adjectives to describe words that will reveal your feelings don t say a movie was exciting or romantic instead describe the film as action packed or dramatic

evidence that looking at money makes us less likely to approve of outward displays of emotion or to use emotional words to express our thoughts find an outlet for your emotions no matter how good you get at keeping everything inside sometimes you will need to release all the emotions writing or playing music is a good way to get out emotional pressures while other people may find getting out their frustrations by kickboxing works better it doesn t matter what activity you choose as long as you can release any anxiety you have on your own terms instead of having a sudden meltdown in front of

how to defend against a knife attack,knife attacks can be very unpredictable and are potentially lethal when wielded by muggers or would be attackers knives can cause more damage than a gun and are much easier to get ahold of when dealing with a knife attack you ll want to stay calm be rational and defend yourself if needed,stay calm if an attacker approaches you you need to stay calm any sudden moves or actions may startle them and escalate the violence take deep breaths as you size each other up to stay relaxed and focused 1 x research source size up your attacker there are different types of attackers and they are all motivated for many different reasons the person may be a mugger or a criminal looking for something fun to do by harassing you they could be mentally unstable or under the influence or drugs or alcohol you may have caught them in the act of some other crime and now they feel the need to get rid of you either way try to figure out what kind of person you re dealing with ask them what they want engaging with the person and talking to them may help ask them why they are attacking you and if there is anything that you can do to prevent the attack 2 x research source if they are a mugger they will ask for your valuables this will be easy enough to deal with all you have to do is give up your things while it may be hard to part with some of your valuables it will be worth your life phones and jewelry can be replaced but your life and health cannot if the person is looking to pick a fight let them know that you have no interest in violence if they are especially menacing or threatening talking may not be an option but try it anyway if the person seems mentally unstable or under the influence of a substance they will be far too unpredictable for you to deal with these are often the most dangerous kind of attackers because it is very hard to judge what they are going to do next try talking to them in a calm soothing voice while backing away yell for help if you re in a public place where others may be able to help you yell for help often people on a city street or a parking lot may not realize that you re in trouble unless you make it very obvious yell stop or someone help me use your voice to make it clear that you re in trouble and someone may come to your aid 3 x research source if you re in a more remote location like a hiking trail or an empty field try yelling anyway while you might not be able to see anyone nearby people may be close enough that they ll be able to tell that something is wrong if you hike often and are afraid of being attacked carry a loud whistle the sound will carry further than your voice alone 4 x research source feel free to scream for help and or call emergency services because both are just like

and deadly weapon running may seem cowardly but it is your best chance of survival 5 x research source make an opening to run if you re attacked by a person with a knife you should always try to run before fighting often however you may seem stuck you may be cornered or your attacker may be blocking your only exit you ll need to disable your attacker to create an opening to run away 6 x research source strike at your attacker s throat going for the throat is one of the best ways to disable an attacker with a hard strike to the throat you ll damage the person s trachea disrupting their breathing they re very likely to stop attacking you after a hard strike to the throat 7 x research source get close enough to strike if your attacker isn t close enough for you to strike at their throat move in a bit you ll want to be an arms width away use your elbow and forearm the harder the part of your body that you use to strike the more effective and painful your attack will be your elbow is solid bone and you ll be able to get a lot of power by striking forward with it push through their throat using your elbow as your weapon strike your attacker s throat strike as hard and as fast as you can using the element of surprise to your advantage run if you ve struck your attacker hard enough they ll lose their ability to breathe when they double over run away kick their groin if your attacker is male a kick to the groin may immediately incapacitate them use your knee or shin to strike them in the crotch to create an opening to run this technique can work with a variety of distances between you and your attacker 8 x research source if you re close to your attacker use your knee a shorter distance between you and the person attacking you means that a knee will be sufficient enough to make a connection force your knee hard into their groin if they are an arm s length away from you use your foot or shin using your shin is better because there s more surface area to cause more damage extend your knee and snap your leg up into their crotch run once your attacker is doubled over or on the ground run away as fast as possible go for your attacker s eyes the eyes are an incredibly sensitive part of your body and any attack focused on the eyes is sure to cause your attacker a lot of pain only use this if your attacker is very close such as in situations where

your fingers to push hard into the eyes pressing them into the skull push down as you push your attackers eyes press them down towards the base of the skull again this technique is not for the faint of heart and should only be used in the most dire of circumstances it can cause blindness and even death run once your attacker is incapacitated or unconscious run away throw off their guard if you can t run and defending yourself is your only option you will want to do something unpredictable spit in your attacker s face or drop suddenly to the ground if you have a backpack or a purse throw it at their head if this gives you an opening to run away do so if not you ll still have thrown them off and given yourself a chance to fight look for a weapon being unarmed against a knife attack is a dangerous position to be in look around your surroundings for anything that you might use as defense especially anything that s heavy or relatively long anything that puts some distance between you and your attacker is good 10 x research source you can make a weapon out of almost anything you find around yourself throw a jacket or shirt over your attacker put keys between your fingers or pick up something heavy nearby and swing it at them 11 x expert source adrian tandez self defense trainer expert interview 24 july 2019 wait for them to make a move when your attacker lunges for you they will be off balance if you found your own weapon now is the time to ram into them if not strike out at them to throw them further off with a kick to the groin or the legs just make sure to steer clear of the knife try to disarm them if you are lucky enough to have a weapon to use strike at the person s hand keeping as much space between you and them as possible this will weaken and damage their hand

choice grabbing their wrist firmly will give you control of the knife s direction and give you a moment to punch or strike them 14 x research source keep punching or striking you may be able to wrest the knife from their control but using both hands to try to take the knife leaves them with an opening to headbutt or punch you instead keep them on the defensive by continuing to attack them 15 x research source fight them to the ground if you re able to continue to hold their wrist and strike at their head and legs until you can get them on the ground once they re on the ground continue to keep the knife pointed away from you 16 x research source don t feel bad for your attacker if and when you get the upper hand your attacker may begin to beg for their life don t be fooled by this most likely they are trying to get you to lower your guard so that they can attack you again kick or throw away the knife throw it as far away as you can onto the roof of a building into the bottom of a dumpster or deep into some woods this will give you time to get away and prevent your attacker from grabbing the knife easily and coming after you 17 x research source enroll in self defense courses while online how tos can give you pointers on how to defend yourself knife attacks are extremely serious and very dangerous most flashy moves and practice scenarios aren t at all like the real thing

murderer from finding you barricade the main entry to your hiding area as best as you can ideally there should be a sturdy lock on the inside of the door and the door should open out so the murderer can t kick it down you may also want to barricade the door with additional obstacles like heavy pieces of furniture 1 x research source if your door swings in it s especially important to barricade it with heavy objects as the murderer may be able to kick it in while it s good to be able to keep the murderer out it s also important to think about how you will escape if the murderer does manage to get in a hiding spot with two exits like a door and a window is ideal 2 x research source if you re outside you may not be able to barricade yourself but you should still look for a secluded location that you will easily be able to escape from if necessary stay quiet once you find a hiding spot you need to do whatever you can to make sure that the murderer does not locate you which means staying as quiet as possible if you are with other people avoid talking to each other you should also make sure your cell phone is silenced 3 x research source the murderer may still be able to hear your phone if it is on vibrate 4 x research source resist the urge to yell to the murderer that you have contacted the police obscure your location make it more difficult for the murderer to see the area you are hiding in by turning off all of the lights and closing all of the windows and blinds make the area look as unoccupied as possible 5 x research source you should also turn off any other sources of light such as computer monitors while calling for help should be your priority beware of the light from your cell phone if the murderer is right outside your door he may be able to see it avoid huddling together if you are hiding with other people spread out as much as you can in your hiding spot this will increase each individual s chances of survival if the murderer gets into your hiding spot 6 x research source make sure everyone stays away from windows as these are often the most vulnerable part of the room hide in behind or under something if you want a great hiding spot within your barricaded room find a piece of furniture or a similar item that you can use to hide in the less obvious the hiding spot the better you may want to hide behind the floor length curtains behind a desk or behind the clothes in a closet you could try hiding under the bed under a pile of laundry or under a blanket you could also consider hiding inside a cupboard in the washing machine or inside a large box if you are outside you may want to hide behind a bush under a car in a trash can or under a porch hide in plain sight if necessary if you are not able to run away or find a place to hide playing dead may be an option this will only work if the murderer has already killed a lot of victims simply lie down among the victims and hope that the murderer doesn t realize that they haven t killed you 7 x research source lying face down or in an obscured location may help as the murderer will not be able to see if you move a little bit call for help as soon as it is safe to do so call emergency services for help if you have a cell phone with you you might be able to do this while you are hiding as long as you don t think that making a call will give away your location to the murderer stay on the line with the operator until the police get there 8 x research source the operator will want to know as many details about the situation as possible such as your location the number of victims and what kinds of weapons the murderer has when the police get there follow their instructions and keep your hands visible at all times so that they know you are not a threat if calling the police is too loud text someone who is not at the location about your situation and ask them to call the police for you consider texting this to several people just in case someone doesn t see the text in some areas it s also possible to text 9 1 1 run if you can if it s possible to get out of the building or the immediate area that the murderer is in this is always preferable to hiding

run don t worry about your belongings leave your stuff behind be sure to keep your hands visible as you flee the scene if the police are there already they may mistake you for the murderer run in an erratic pattern this will make it harder for the murderer to shoot you if he comes after you try to put as many obstacles between you and the murderer as possible head for safety if you choose to run it s important to head for a location that will be safer than the location you just left just in case the murderer pursues you while you may just want to get out of there don t leave without some kind of an idea of where you will go if possible get to a location where you can call for help a secure location like a police station is the best option but a neighbor s house is better than nothing try to avoid running into your neighbor s house if the murderer is watching you you don t want to put them in danger as well by leading a murderer into their house if there is nothing around the area head for the woods instead of a clearing this will give you many more places to hide a full parking lot will also provide lots of good hiding opportunities plan to fight if you must in some cases you may have no choice but to fight back against the murderer this is generally not a good idea unless your life is in immediate danger but if it comes to it do what you need to do to survive 10 x research source if you decide to fight you need to commit to it a half hearted attempt at fighting back will only put you in more danger your goal should be to disarm and or incapacitate the murderer and then

no other option but to attack the murderer with your bare hands aim for the most vulnerable parts of the body the throat the eyes the groin and the stomach 12 x research source use an improvised weapon if you choose to fight back and you do not have a traditional weapon look around for ordinary objects that you might be able to use to disarm the murderer or incapacitate them a good weapon should be easy to use and should be reasonably likely to inflict harm 13 x research source you can use a backpack as a shield or to swing at the murderer you can use an item like a baseball bat and umbrella or a large flashlight as a swinging weapon any heavy item can be used to knock the murderer unconscious a chemical fire extinguisher can effectively disable a person if you spray it in his face 14 x research source cooperate if you are captured if the murderer finds you and it is not possible to escape or fight back if they have a gun and you only have a baseball bat for example it is important to know how to interact with them in order to increase your chances of survival if the person s primary objective is to steal things or commit another crime they may not really want to kill you if it s not necessary 15 x research source be as cooperative as you possibly can be do what the murderer asks you to do without asking questions avoid making eye contact as this can be seen as threatening don t make any sudden movements that the murderer might interpret as you trying to fight always be on the lookout for opportunities to run or incapacitate the murderer make your house

invest in security cameras as well whether you have an alarm system or not put up stickers that say you do this often deters criminals just as much as an actual alarm prepare a safe room in your home

room should have a sturdy door and a strong lock on the inside you can have a special steel security door installed for extra protection make sure the room is somewhere that will be accessible to your family and far from the areas where an intruder is most likely to enter your home a closet or bathroom near the bedrooms is a good choice keep important supplies in your safe room in addition to

does break into your house 19 x research source it s a good idea to charge your phone in this room every night so that you will always be able to call for help if you have to hide there if you have

how to defend yourself,the difference between walking away and becoming tomorrow s newspaper headline is how well you are prepared to protect yourself in a bad situation you can prepare some simple techniques to defend yourself before and during an attack whether it be a fight or an ambush ensuring your safety,guard your face if the attacker is trying to punch you or grab you from the front put your hands on your forehead in a not in the face sort of gesture and your arms tight on your body 1 x research source this may look like a weak defensive position but that is to your advantage since it brings your opponent s guard down in addition this position protects your face and your ribs two places you ll likely want to protect stand with a wide base both left to right and back to front keep your feet diagonal from each other in a kind of martial arts stance this will lessen your likelihood of getting knocked or pushed over 2 x research source you stand the best chance of winning a fight and getting away if you stay upright avoid taking the scuffle to the ground at all costs assess your assailant look at their hands if they were about to attack with their hands they would have their hands out however if they are concealing a weapon they will have them hidden or at their side if you re attacked by a person with a knife or a gun you need to try to avoid confrontation and get away if it s impossible to avoid a fight you need to end the confrontation with a high impact attack as quickly as possible then run for help take the defensive posture of running unless your attacker is making it impossible trying to get away is the only guarantee of your safety if you can avoid a fight avoid it and run away remember to never turn your back on an opponent if you do this the opponent will use this as a chance to attack go for the eyes and nose if you have to end the fight as quickly as possible by striking first strike hard and strike as many times as you can then run for help getting ambushed in an alley by a mugger isn t the time to worry about fighting honorably keep yourself safe by making the confrontation as quickly as possible 3 x research source the eyes and nose are the most sensitive soft spots on your attacker s face and are vulnerable to elbows knees and your forehead with the hardest part of your forehead right near the hairline try to smash your assailant s nose by tensing your neck and driving your forehead into the middle of their face this is the quickest and most unexpected way to end a fight completely however strong experienced or violent your attacker it s very difficult to quickly recover from a hard head butt to the nose kick or grab the groin of a male attacker bringing a knee sharply into the groin of an attacker or grabbing the groin with your hand and twisting is an instantly effective move that will take your attacker down again this isn t the time to worry about fighting dirty if your life is in danger go for the groin 4 x research source if this doubles up your opponent consider smashing your knee into his nose to ensure that he ll be down for the count stomp your heel if your being attacked from the back chances are the attacker has his her arms around your upper half if your wearing heels or shoes such as heavy heel boots this is especially effective move your foot near the attacker s lift your foot up and bring it down on their foot as hard as you can if they let you go run if they don t try the next idea 5 x research source go for the kneecaps if for example you are being choked or your assailant has their hands up in your face attacking their legs will give you the opportunity to open him up to more attacks or allow you to escape 6 x research source this is especially effective on larger attackers and easy to do from your guarded position kick at shins and knees soccer style with the instep of your foot this is a quick and painful kick in addition if his her legs are close enough lift your knees into their inner leg femoral nerve outer leg knee or groin these will break down your attacker and may disable them follow up try to poke or press on the eyes no one can defend an eye poke regardless of your attacker s size clapping on the ears can stun or if done perfectly breaks the eardrums in some cases you may also want to attack your attacker s neck to effectively choke someone do not do the typical hollywood hands around the entire neck but instead just put your thumb and fingers around the trachea especially easy to find on men with large adam s apples dig drive and sink your fingers into this notch and they will experience intense pain and probably fall down note that poking the eyes breaking the eardrums and choking someone can all be extremely harmful only do these actions in extreme circumstances in which your life may be in danger otherwise fall onto your attacker if you lose your balance if you fall try to fall on top of your attacker you ll want to avoid taking the fight to the ground at all costs but if it s unavoidable use your weight to your advantage while falling keep the pointy parts of your body pointy your knees and your elbows and aim for your attacker s groin ribs and neck be prepared for an assault with a weapon if an attacker attacks with a weapon know where the weapon is effective if your attacker has a knife try to stay out of arm s length if there is a gun consider running and dodging from left to right if you get a chance to leave safely go for it be sure that you re safe from your opponent when you decide to stop defending yourself in many cases you can end the situation immediately by giving the attacker your wallet this is a logical choice especially if at knife or gunpoint your life is worth much more than the cash and cards you have on you toss the wallet away from you and run deflect the hold if an attacker tries to grab you from behind to choke you press his forearm against your collarbone instead of trying to pull it directly off which may be difficult if you re fighting with someone stronger than you put one hand above his elbow on the forearm and one hand below it so your hands are on both sides of the elbow now in one strong and determined movement step and swing your entire body around like the arm is the hinge to your body s screen door 7 x research source this will get you out of his her choke and leave his her head ribs and legs wide open to your counterattack when your attacker is behind you the shins are right behind your legs and primed for your stomping and raking sit down if the attacker is trying to pick you up from behind drop your hips quickly and violently as if you were plopping down on a love seat this will make you harder to pick up and give you an extra moment to attack them and fend them off by stomping on their shins or repositioning for a frontal defense get dirty if the attacker is trying to choke you by wrapping his arms around your neck bring the ball of your foot forward as if you just kicked a soccer ball and forcefully slam it into the area of their leg between their ankle and mid leg or the groin this may break their leg or otherwise incapacitate your attacker understand the stages of a fight preparing for each stage in a confrontation can help you avoid eventually ending up in a physical fight avoiding a serious fight should be your main goal so you need to be bigger and more aware of the situation than your opponent the stages of conflict include the wind up this is the initial argument before the fight erupts it might start out relatively harmless but escalate quickly and unexpectedly verbal threats when the arguing brings in the threat of physical confrontation try saying i m going to _____ shoving or other prodding behavior attempts to get you to escalate a conflict into a full blown fight usually start not with punches or kicks but with nose to nose intimidation tactics and shoves it s still possible to walk away at this point without getting into a full blown fight the full blown fight you ve stopped arguing and started throwing punches 8 x research source take all verbal or directional paths to non confrontation each of the lead up steps above are opportunities to end the argument one will inevitably lead to another unless one of you backs down so try to back down actual physical confrontation should be your last line of defense 9 x research source if you re in the middle of an argument calm it down by lowering your voice macho dudes in a bar can escalate stupid things quickly but be ready to hug and buy you a drink by apologizing and distracting them if you re calm they ll cool down if you re being ambushed by an attacker you need to get where people can see you and help you it s less likely that you ll be grievously harmed if you re on a busy street corner where people are passing by the confrontation has less of a chance of escalating in public avoid walking alone if you ve got a long walk home from the bus or train station at night after work consider meeting a friend near the metro stop and walking together staying in groups is the safest way to avoid these kinds of situations if you must walk alone gloom onto another group of walkers and stick close by you don t have to know them to find safety in numbers arm yourself concealed handguns mace or pepper spray are all handy defense devices you should consider having at the ready knives and guns are dangerous weapons many consider useful but can also be used against you if you re unprepared to use them yourself be very cautious and smart if you choose to carry a weapon and take the proper certification classes to make sure you know how to handle a weapon safely never carry one illegally most states that respect individuals rights have ccw permits available for law abiding citizens you can also get a small personal alarm keychain that will emit a high pitch siren like a car alarm when its pin is pulled similar in design to a grenade consider taking a self defense class if you live in a dangerous area and are concerned for your well being,Personal-Care-and-Style
how to beat a taller and bigger opponent in a street fight,let s face it size does matter so if you ever find yourself in an altercation with a larger opponent it will be worth knowing how to employ the right offensive and defensive strategies to overcome their height and reach advantage assuming you have no other option than to stand and slug it out you ll need to be able to wear them down with superior movement and well placed attacks this type of situation can be quite intimidating but if you keep a cool head and make the right moves you re sure to come out on top,don t fight unless you have to when faced with a bigger opponent you re going to be at a disadvantage from the start unless there s truly no other option try to defuse or avoid physical violence at all costs do your best to make peace or simply walk away if you can there is no shame in running from a fight especially if you don t know how it will turn out your opponent may be carrying a concealed weapon or have friends lying in wait to gang up on you your primary goal should be getting yourself out of harm s way 1 x research source getting away from a violent situation before it erupts should be considered a victory if a fight becomes unavoidable stay relaxed when you panic your ability to gauge your surroundings and employ effective strategies shuts down keep your guard up keep your hands up to defend your head at all times your forearms should be held vertical and parallel with palms turned inward toward your cheeks squeeze your fists together lightly until you re ready to throw a counterpunch hunch slightly to bring your elbows down closer to your midsection to protect your ribs and abdomen from body blows don t allow your guard to fall or get lax even when you re tired dropping your guard leaves you wide open for that one good shot which could mean the end of the fight make sure you assume a guard from which you can quickly and comfortably deliver punches or elbow strikes dodge strikes rather than blocking them an aggressor who is bigger than you is also likely to be stronger so it s not recommended that you try to stop his attacks directly instead stay mobile to swiftly escape from his punching range making him chase you will exhaust him and with every missed attack he ll lose a little more steam if there s no chance of getting a safe distance away slide your head to the outside of the punch so that it passes by harmlessly then immediately rush in and hit back 2 x research source evading is always preferable to blocking because it doesn t require you to absorb force with any part of the body dodging a punch using only head movement is known in boxing as a slip slipping punches is an excellent way to avoid being hit while expending minimal energy 3 x research source don t wrestle with your opponent the bigger stronger person always has the edge in a grappling match don t put yourself in unnecessary danger by allowing your opponent to take hold of you keep just outside his reach until the time comes to counter then capitalize and pull away again if the fight goes to the ground you re looking at a scenario where you have even less control as your speed evasiveness and precision will go right out the window if one of you takes the other down or you happen to trip get back to your feet as quickly as you can you have a much better chance of outclassing a large opponent in a stand up encounter 4 x research source be prepared to take a punch it s unlikely that you ll walk away from a fight with a larger opponent unscathed you may have to eat a few punches if you get caught off guard or while you re trying to find a way to slip inside keep this in mind and ready yourself mentally getting hit is no fun but it could end up being much worse if you let it take you by surprise 5 x research source if you do have to take a hit try to do it on the shoulder or forehead which is a harder less vulnerable surface than the jaw or the rest of the face let your body sway in the direction of the punch to lessen its impact 6 x research source during a physical altercation your body will be flushed with adrenaline which can keep you from feeling as much pain use evasive tactics move constantly to keep the larger opponent from grabbing you or landing strikes stay light and poised on the balls of your feet so that you can change directions quickly and keep him guessing since his reach is longer than yours stay safely outside of it until you re ready to move in and counter with a strike or takedown of your own 7 x research source one method you could employ is to dance or move in a circular motion around your opponent while staying outside of his striking range when you sense a punch coming duck dodge make sure you re too far away for it to connect 8 x research source since the legs are longer than the arms becoming proficient at kicking can help overcome your opponent s reach advantage whatever you do don t let a larger opponent get their hands on you one wrong move could end the fight in their favor get in close when your opponent is least prepared close the distance between you and move in close this will neutralize his superior size and reach and put him in the right range to land some hard shots of your own finding the right timing and approach for getting in close is paramount for emerging victorious you cannot win a fight with a bigger attacker by playing into his strengths 9 x research source when negotiating range with a bigger opponent the most important thing to remember is to stay out of the danger zone this is the range at which he can hit you but you can t hit him back due to his added reach move in suddenly after dodging a blow or feinting one of your own or follow your opponent s punching arm back as he retracts it tire them out one of the downsides of being taller and heavier is that it takes more effort to move and as a result you run out of energy faster use this to your advantage keep slipping dodging and moving constantly until your opponent begins to slow down at that point you can use your speed to slip into close range and unleash some punishing offense of your own 10 x research source working out to improve your cardiovascular conditioning can prepare you in the event that you need to be able to outlast an opponent s onslaught during a fight the strategy of allowing an adversary to tire themselves out before finishing them off has become known as the rope a dope principle muhammad ali used this gameplan to win a championship bout with the larger george foreman at the rumble in the jungle in 1974 11 x research source use the element of surprise if you suspect things are about to take a nasty turn be the one to make the first move end a tense standoff with a sudden well placed blow to the jaw or solar plexus the soft fleshy outer edge of the diaphragm beneath the sternum put everything you ve got into the strike try to put a stop to the fight in a single maneuver if you re successful your opponent will be incapacitated and the altercation will be over if not you ll at least already be ready for the ensuing brawl 12 x research source assess the situation as best you can before resorting to a surprise attack in many cases the aggressor might simply be worked up and won t have any intention of actually getting into a physical dispute be certain that you ve exhausted all other options first be careful when going for a sucker punch if it misses or doesn t do the trick there will be no way to avoid a full on fight stick and move it s worth repeating that you shouldn t try to stand and duke it out with a bigger guy his reach and power will just be too much to handle take your time staying away from his strikes waiting for an opening and then closing the gap and landing a hard shot by alternating between defensive posturing and quick offensive bursts you ll eventually be able to wear him down 13 x research source don t get impatient you ll start making mistakes which could end up costing you dearly attack the body when you don t have a clear shot at your opponent s head the solar plexus is a sensitive target that when hit just right can drive all the air out of an opponent s lungs and leave them gasping for breath the ribs are also quite fragile and can be broken with only a few pounds of force per square inch aim for sensitive targets unlike a boxing match which has regulations about where you re allowed to hit an opponent all bets are off in a real fight target the most delicate areas of your attacker s body to make every strike count one well placed blow is all you ll need to put your towering opponent out of commission most people won t be expecting these types of attacks so they ll be left without a ready defense everybody has the same anatomical weakness despite size differences strikes that target an opponent s sensory organs will leave them temporarily stunned enabling you to get away or follow up with a hard hit an open hand slap to the ear is just as good as a left hook for shattering an opponent s equilibrium if not better hitting the nose can blind them momentarily by causing their eyes to well up with tears which gives you an opportunity to throw a fight ending punch a kick to the groin will compromise their mobility and instantly take the will to fight out of them go for submissions on the ground let s say you get taken down with your opponent on top of you and you re unable to climb to your feet in this situation scramble for a submission technique a hold or lock that incapacitates an attacker by neutralizing a single part of the body by applying a joint lock armbar or choke you may be able to do enough damage to put an end to the scuffle no matter how big or tough someone is they won t be able to hurt you if they re unconscious or have a broken arm 14 x research source apply a rear naked choke or triangle choke depending on your positioning chokes disrupt an opponent s circulation or ability to breathe causing unconsciousness it only takes a firm hold and a few moments to put an opponent to sleep 15 x research source 16 x research source armbars are holds that apply pressure to the elbow joint or shoulder they are effective against attackers who leave their arms extended momentarily after throwing a punch as a bonus disabling an arm means they can t hit you anymore 17 x research source don t be afraid to fight dirty forget about honor or fairness there are no rules on the street you don t know how badly you might be injured if you come out on the losing end of a fight so you shouldn t be discouraged from being vicious bite gouge eyes pull hair chop the throat bend fingers back knee the groin and do anything else you have to do to survive 18 x research source turn objects around you such as bottles chairs rocks pens or even your cell phone into improvised weapons in the best case scenario the sight of you holding a weapon may be enough to make your attacker back down to avoid escalating the violence further make a run for it as soon as you have your opponent reeling,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to be consistent,consistency is a great characteristic to build and implement in your life the key to consistency is setting and achieving specific goals start by determining how you want to be more consistent in your life and aim for these small goals over time as you become more consistent keep yourself motivated and accountable this may require some change in thinking so that you stay optimistic and productive throughout the process,create specific and realistic goals it s hard to be consistent if you don t have a strong idea of what you need to do when starting your new path create easy simple goals with specific measurable results 1 x research source start by defining what consistency means to you do you need to be consistent about your exercise habits are you aiming for a higher quality of work do you want to be more available and reliable in your relationships once you ve identified your end goal come up with smaller steps to reach it for example if you want to become more physically fit you might set the goal to exercise for 5 days out of the week or to sign up for a class be specific instead of saying i m going to consistently appreciate my significant other you might say i m going to thank my significant other when they wash the dishes make dinner or help out around the house create a schedule for yourself it can be easy to pile on tasks and promises but a calendar planner or schedule will keep you on track a schedule will help you plan your day so that you get everything done on time it will also help you understand what commitments you do and do not have time for 2 x research source use a paper planner or a desk calendar alternatively download a scheduling app on your phone like google calendar or outlook block off realistic amounts of time for each task if you re uncertain how long a task will take give yourself extra time to complete it for larger goals like writing a book or losing weight set small daily tasks that you can do to work towards this goal for example you might set a daily word count to achieve or plan specific meals to eat each day don t forget to plan in breaks as well don t schedule anything else for that day or time place reminders around your home workspace and belongings sometimes it is easy to forget our new goals habits commitments or promises especially when we make them to ourselves to remind yourself throughout the day put messages to yourself in visible areas 3 x research source write down your goals on post it notes and place them on your mirror computer refrigerator car dashboard and planner slip a piece of paper with your goals into your wallet desk drawer or purse if you are trying implement a daily practice put a reminder on your phone set an alarm or use a reminder app to alert you when you need to do it make promises only if you can keep them consistency often involves making commitments and keeping them it is easy to get overwhelmed however if you make too many promises if you think a request may be difficult to do say no 4 x research source for example if you tell your significant other that you re going to handle half of the chores make sure that you have time after work to actually do them in some cases you may be able to negotiate a promise that you will be able to keep for example if someone asks you to help them move you can say well i can t make it before 3 pm but i could swing by after does that work this includes making promises to yourself if you know it is unrealistic for you to write 10 pages a day for your new novel promise yourself that you ll just write at least a little bit each day reward yourself when you get something done if you do complete your goals give yourself a reward even small goals deserve small rewards to help keep you motivated throughout the process 5 x research source for example if you ve managed to complete your work by 5 pm every day for a week take an evening off go see a movie or treat yourself to a special dinner if you re training for a marathon and you ve managed to hit your daily exercise goals sign up for a 5k to give you a sense of your success if you ve managed to improve your relationships by being more consistent your friendships may be the reward if you re proud of yourself take your friends out or host a dinner keep going if you make a mistake even the most consistent and well organized people slip up sometimes plan for potential failure and don t beat yourself up if you make a mistake along the way 6 x research source just because you had to cancel an appointment break a promise or pass a deadline doesn t mean you re not consistent sometimes despite our best planning external factors can get in the way plan for your setbacks and failures if a literary agent rejects your manuscript figure out where next to send it or look it over to see what might be improved consistency doesn t equal perfection if you miss a day at the gym or fail to read your child a book at night encourage yourself to start again the very next day take time off to recharge consistency doesn t mean that you are working all of the time in fact if you give yourself time off you ll improve your productivity and avoid burning out schedule in time for yourself and don t let work or other commitments get in the way 7 x research source for example you might give yourself an hour each evening to read take a bath or watch tv don t work during this time meditation is a great way to quiet your brain and give yourself some peace practice meditating for at least 5 minutes each day and work your way up to 15 minutes at a time don t push aside your personal time if you have other responsibilities for example if you need saturday mornings to sleep in don t promise your significant other that you ll wake up to mow your lawn tell them you ll do it on another day or time and make sure to come through on this promise use motivational tools to keep going even when you don t feel like it when you re tired or stressed it can be easy just to let your goals slide for a day but these actions can quickly cause you to get off track if you re feeling down or lazy try to find new sources of motivation 8 x research source space out small rewards throughout the day to keep you going for example if you re writing a long paper give yourself a 5 minute break every time you finish a page or 2 remind yourself of your long term goals tell yourself that if you want to achieve those goals you ll have to get this task done for example instead of saying i really don t want to write those reports you might think once i get those reports done i ll have time to do something else if you re having a difficult day make a compromise with yourself for example if you want to eat healthy more consistently but you can t bring yourself to cook pick up a salad instead of fast food hold yourself accountable to be consistent you have to make sure that you recognize when you don t reach the standards and goals that you ve set in these moments consider if your goals are realistic or ask yourself what you can do to improve 9 x research source on your schedule or calendar check off tasks that you have completed this will give you a sense of satisfaction it will also help you realize what you can realistically accomplish in 1 day ask a friend family member mentor or coworker to be your accountability partner have them check in once a week to see what your progress is like if they see you not behaving consistently give them permission to call you out don t beat yourself up when you don t hit the mark what matters is that you keep working towards your goals and towards consistency give yourself time to see changes whenever you try to establish new habits understand that it can take time instead of uprooting your life with several new practices at once allow yourself time to figure out what works be realistic with what you can expect to see over time 10 x research source it usually takes 3 weeks of consistently doing something to make a new habit every three weeks set a small goal to attain in that time period don t tackle too much start with small rituals and build your way up set boundaries for your commitments and personal relationships boundaries make it easier to keep commitments because you have a specific limit in which to function before taking on new tasks or promises establish what you are willing and able to do as well as what you know you realistically can t do 11 x research source for example you might establish that you won t take phone calls during a family dinner tell your boss coworkers and friends that this time is off limits put your phone in another room during dinner you can also establish quality markers for yourself for example you might tell yourself that you will check your work twice before submitting it to your boss give yourself extra time to complete this task so that you achieve consistent quality build your willpower consistency requires willpower to achieve because consistency tends to lean towards performing even when you don t feel like it to do that you need to have the willpower to do it 12 x research source avoid temptation wherever possible for example if you want to be consistent about eating healthy make sure that you have healthy options on hand for when you re hungry don t keep unhealthy food around exhaustion can cause you to skip tasks get at least 7 9 hours of sleep a night to keep yourself going remind yourself of the long term benefits whenever you feel unmotivated read over your list of goals for inspiration eliminate negative thinking negative thinking is the bane of consistency and of willpower when you think negatively you are making yourself less likely to be able to hold to your consistent actions 13 x research source pay attention to negative thought patterns that will hinder you in the future catch yourself if you start thinking i can t do this or i m stupid when you do notice these negative thought patterns turn them around or introduce a more positive or neutral thought so for example if you find yourself thinking i can t do this turn it around and think i m going to practice doing this even if i m not great at it to start with if you re starting to dread a task or goal revise the the task goal or outcome break it up into smaller steps or promise yourself a reward when you get it done,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to become more talkative,some people seem like conversational superstars able to rattle off stories and witty jokes as if it were nothing but if you re the quiet or introverted type it can seem difficult to work up the courage to speak at all whatever your tendency you can learn to talk not just more but with more substance in your words making you a better conversationalist learn to start conversations and keep them going whether you re one on one in a group or in a school setting,lead with something you know you can both talk about the biggest thing that keeps us from starting conversations is the fear that you ll approach someone open your mouth and then have absolutely nothing to say fortunately there are a few easy ways that you can always be sure you ll pick something you can both talk about comfortably assess the situation if you re in class with someone you can always start by talking about class if you re at the same party talk about the party it doesn t need to be complicated what do you think of this neighborhood is even a fine way to start a conversation never try to approach a stranger and start a conversation with a pick up line or other lame jokes while it s not necessarily rude asking someone how much a polar bear weighs doesn t give you a chance to make conversation it just gives you a lame dead end remember to use good form form is an acronym commonly used in some conversation coaching which helps you to remember topics that are always good for starting conversations and assorted prompts for starting them whether you know the person well or you re just meeting someone it s a good rule of thumb for picking conversation starters family occupation recreation and motivation 1 x research source family how s your mom these days or how are your parents doing how many brothers and sisters do you have or did you all get along what was your best worst family vacation occupation what do you do or how are you enjoying your new job what s the toughest thing you ve got going on at work or what was the most interesting thing you did there this week what are the people you work with like recreation what do you do for fun or what is there to do around here for fun how long have you been doing that do you have a regular group of people you do that with motivation what do you want to do after school or do you think you ll be at that job for long what s your dream job what do you want to be doing down the road ask open ended questions it s absolutely critical that you start conversations by giving people the chance to talk and responding to them in turn this is what makes you talkative not the ability to chatter on about yourself open ended questions give other people the opportunity to open up and give you more to respond to and more to talk about in the conversation 2 x research source open ended questions can be used to follow up closed answers if someone reticent to talk and says i m doing ok i guess in response to your what s up say what did you do today and follow it up with how did it go get them talking open ended questions have to do with opinions you can t answer an open ended question with yes or no answers don t ask closed questions like what s your name or do you come here a lot this doesn t give you anything to talk about recall previous conversations sometimes it s actually harder to talk to people you know a little bit as opposed to strangers if you already know someone s family history and basic story you it s good to try to recall previous conversations to look for follow up questions to find out what they ve been up to what d you do today or what have you been up to since i ve seen you how was that project at school did you get it finished ok those pictures of vacation on facebook looked great how was the trip practice good listening skills as well as talking good conversation is about more than flapping your gums if you want to be more talkative it s important to practice good listening and not just wait for your turn to talk make eye contact with the person and use open body language nod your head when you agree and focus on the conversation follow up with things like oh wow then what happened or how did that turn out really listen and respond to what the other person is saying practicing training yourself to paraphrase saying what i m hearing is and it sounds like what you re saying is never be more talkative by simply one upping people in conversation or responding to what they ve said by talking about yourself all the time listen and respond read the other person s body language for clues some people just don t want to talk and it won t make the situation better if you force it pay close attention for people who are displaying closed body language and disengage from the conversation focus your talkative skills on someone else instead closed body language includes things like looking over your head and around the room as if looking for an exit closed or crossed arms are sometimes a sign of closed body language as well as leaning one s shoulder toward you or away from you 3 x research source open body language consists of leaning forward making eye contact and listen to the other person smile a lot of conversation is non verbal people are a lot more willing to engage happy open friendly looking people in conversation you can do a lot to encourage other people in conversation and get them to engage you if you use open body language and smile 4 x research source you don t have to look like a grinning idiot just look like you re happy to be where you are even if you re feeling uncomfortable no furrowed brows and sour faces lift your eyebrows and keep your chin up smile look for open doors in the conversation good conversationalists make this easy but even with closed off people you can learn to find doors to open into other topics and avenues looking for a personal connection that can give you something to really talk about together it s kind of an art but there are some tricks to developing it in yourself ask about someone s history with a particular subject if someone mentions going running ask them how long they ve been running whether or not they enjoy it where they go running and other associated questions ask about someone s opinion of a particular subject if someone mentions working at burger king during high school ask what it was like solicit their opinion always be following up there s no problem in following up someone s short answer with why s that or how smile to avoid seeming like you re prying and that you re actually just curious don t be afraid to go deep people like to talk about themselves so don t be afraid of soliciting their opinions and doing a little probing into their mind while some people who are more guarded may be reticent to talk others will enjoy being able to share their opinion with someone who is generally curious you can always back track if you need to and say sorry i don t mean to pry i m just curious think out loud don t be silent while you think of answers to questions you ve been asked just start paraphrasing what the other person has said and let yourself start talking if you re a generally shy person it s likely that you re overthinking what you say before you say it and often it ll come out just as well if not better the less you censor yourself and the more you just allow yourself to speak lots of people worry about sounding dumb or that they re going to not say the right thing but this usually results in unnatural speech patterns and awkward timing in conversations if you want to be more talkative practice responding even if you re not positive what you re going to say don t be afraid to switch topics sometimes a subject will just die out and then awkwardness can quickly set in if you don t have anything more to say about a particular subject don t be afraid to hop to something else even if it doesn t necessarily follow if you re having drinks and talking about football and then football dries up gesture to the drink and ask something like how is that what s in it again talk drinks for a while while you think of other subjects talk about what you want to talk about and what you know a lot about things that you re very knowledgeable about are interesting to other people at least people who are worth talking to stay informed about current events if you run out of things to talk about it s good to have a pretty good grasp of current events common topics and big headlines so you can talk about something that your conversation partner is likely to have heard of and you can find common ground you don t even have to know a lot about topics to engage in conversation say something like what s the deal with this new senate controversy i haven t really heard specifics have you you don t have to be a man to fall into the mansplaining trap never assume that the person you re talking to doesn t know anything about a topic even if it s obscure or very specific or it may come off as condescension speak louder if you re not as talkative as you d like to be in one on one conversations talking in big groups can be an even bigger challenge but if you want your voice to be heard one of the most important things to learn is to speak at a volume that will allow it to be heard more easily many reticent people are also somewhat quiet and introverted larger groups tend to favor extroverts and loud talkers which means you ll have to slightly tailor your voice to the group try this grab the floor of the conversation by raising your voice to the level of the others but then drop to your natural speaking voice when people are listening so you don t have to fake it bring them to you not vice versa don t wait for a silence sometimes group conversations can feel like that game frogger you re looking at a big street heavy with traffic and trying to find an opening that never comes but the secret with that game is that you just have to dive in those silences when they come are never obvious or expected so it s important to risk interrupting someone instead of waiting for absolute silence before speaking try not to interrupt people by talking over but use interjection words before they re done like saying so or wait a minute or even i ve got something to say and then waiting for them to finish you ll have grabbed the floor without talking over them completely make it known you want to speak with body language if you have something to say look at the speaker lean forward and use open body language that communicates you re engaged in the conversation and want to say something someone may even pass you the floor by requesting your input if you look like you want to talk sometimes if you feel like you re getting run over by the conversation truck it s tempting to get frustrated and disengage from the conversation but this will only make it more difficult to talk and will keep others from recognizing that you might want to speak offer alternatives in a group setting the conversation can quickly get boring if everyone is just saying the same thing so it s good to play devil s advocate on occasion if the conversation calls for it if you find yourself disagreeing with the group opinion try gently voicing your disagreement make sure to soften disagreement by leading with i guess i m seeing this a little differently but or good point but i m not sure i agree you don t have to adopt ideas or opinions that aren t your own just to say something especially if you can t back it up if you disagree though feel free to voice it conversations aren t cults that punish dissent start a side conversation if necessary some people struggle to socialize in larger groups and flourish in one on one environments there s nothing wrong with these people a recent personality study found that many people fall into one of two groups based on whether or not they were able to contribute to larger groups or one on one talks better these groups are dyads and triads 5 x research source dad s struggle to find purchase in larger groups if you want to talk to someone but struggle in a group of three or more people take the person aside and talk then talk to other people in the group one on one to get into your own comfort zone it won t seem rude if you make the time for everyone plan out a comment talking in class is a whole different ballgame and what might seem awkward or unusual during informal conversations is sometimes perfectly appropriate and even expected in the classroom setting the best example of this is group discussions when it s perfectly appropriate to write out or pre plan comments that you might want to share with the class in general it can be hard to remember to bring up points you might have thought of while doing the reading in english class or questions you had about the homework during math so write these out and bring them up next time you re in class nothing wrong with a script for school ask a question the best way to contribute to class is to ask questions any time you don t understand something or feel like you re unclear about an issue or topic raise your hand and ask a question it s a rule of thumb that any time one student doesn t get it there are probably five more who don t have the guts to raise their hand be the brave one only ask questions that benefit the group or that apply to the group it s not appropriate to raise your hand to ask why did i get a b on this agree with another student s comment if you re having a group discussion and are struggling for something to say there s usually good opportunities to piggy back on other students comments which has the effect of making it look like you re saying something even if you re really not wait for someone to say something that sounds good then chip in with i agree and paraphrase it in your own words easy comment points paraphrase get in the habit of working things that have already been said and translating it into your own version of what was said adding bits and pieces to it as you go this is a great way to contribute to class without really having anything to say that wasn t already said of course it s better if you add a little to make it worth your teacher s while if someone says i think this book is really about the family dynamics and the bad stuff they re all hiding you know get your translation cap on and polish up the comment say i agree i think you can really see the patriarchy at work in the father son relationship displayed in this novel especially in the downfall of the title character bonus points for pointing out specifics find a quotation or a problem in your book that illustrates a point someone else has brought up aim for at least one contribution per class period generally you don t need to be the most talkative person in your class just talkative enough to let your presence be known most of the time that means at least once per class period this can also have the effect of keeping the teacher from picking on you later if the rest of the class is being quiet plan out a point get it out of the way and then sit back and listen,Personal-Care-and-Style

don t be aggressive you should never resort to outright aggression in the process of standing up for yourself being aggressive or even violent is counter productive and will not win you any friends acting aggressively verbally or otherwise is like acting out your pain in full technicolor it s not a constructive way to get what you want and will simply turn people against you you are far more likely to achieve a positive result if you approach any issues as calmly and objectively as possible you can still stand your ground and be firm and assertive without having to raise your voice or get angry 9 x research source avoid being passive aggressive be wary of taking passive aggressive responses toward people and situations 10 x trustworthy source greater good magazine journal published by uc berkeley s greater good science center which uses scientific research to promote happier living go to source passive aggressive responses are ones in which you begrudgingly do things against your will and end up filled with resentment and anger hating people who make you feel this way feeling depressed and helpless this negatively affects your relationships and can take a huge toll on your physical and emotional health most of all a passive aggressive approach to life will never enable you to stand up for yourself try to turn negatives into positives another way of standing up for

insecurity are at the root of the attack for example if someone claims you re bossy rather than letting it cause you to shrink some more take this as evidence that you re a natural leader able to manage people and projects well and a proactive change agent if someone claims you re shy take it as a compliment that means you re not ready to jump on the latest bandwagon but like to reflect over the consequences first and then make up your mind if someone says you re too sensitive or emotional let this be a sign that you ve got a big heart and aren t afraid to let everyone see it or maybe someone suggested you re not career minded enough for you that confirms you re living a stress free life that will help you to live longer don t give up no matter how hard you try to increase your confidence there will be days when you feel that you re backsliding rather than seeing this as a defeat in your attempt to learn to stand up for yourself see it for what it is a day or so where things went temporarily off track before you feel better and bounce back some tricks to help the bounce back process include fake it till you make it even if you don t feel confident act as if you do be consistent in your approach people will grow to expect that the person you are now is a person who stands up for himself expect some people to find your more assertive stance challenging it can take time to reshape the patterns you ve formerly established with people who used to walk all over you in some cases you ll find you no longer want to be a part of their lives take it as it

enough to give you access to the back of their shoulders if you don t have an appropriate chair or stool available place a comfortable cushion on the ground have your partner sit cross legged on the ground while you kneel behind them use light long strokes 3 x research source when we think of massages most of us immediately think of the swedish massage it uses long gentle motions along the surface of the muscles instead of the intense pressure of a style like the deep tissue massage when you find tension knots you can apply focused pressure for the most part though keep the pressure firm but not intense warm the muscles up rushing into intense massaging before warming up the muscles can cause your partner to tense up even more under your touch ease into the massage by using your fingertips to loosen up and prepare the neck and shoulders this will put them in the frame of mind to relax into the experience place the ring middle and index fingertips of your hands where the base of your partner s head meets the neck apply light but firm pressure if that feels uncomfortable use whichever fingertips feel right to you you might use just index and middle fingers slide your fingers down the sides of their neck sweeping over onto the shoulders make sure to apply even pressure throughout running your fingers over the muscles knead your thumbs into the tense muscles in the previous step you may have felt hard knots in the muscles these knots indicate tension and they need focused pressure from your thumbs place your thumbs on the tension knot place your other four fingers on each hand on the front of your partner s shoulder to stabilize your thumbs when you apply pressure apply firm pressure with your thumbs in a kneading circular motion to release the tension in the muscles do this throughout the shoulder muscles but especially on tension knots glide your fingers up and down the neck the muscles in the back and sides of the neck also carry a great deal of stress you will use one hand to warm up the neck muscles for more focused attention place your thumb on one side of the neck and the tips of your other four fingers on the other side of the neck apply and maintain firm but gentle pressure glide your hand up and down the length of the neck move along the width of the neck as well glide along the muscles along either side of the spinal column on the back of the neck widen your hand to loosen the muscles on the sides of the neck as well pinch along the back of the neck 4 x research source you want to apply the same focused pressure along the sides of the neck with your thumb but you need your other four fingers to stabilize the pressure you re applying with your thumb working with both hands at once would force you to wrap your other fingers around the front of the throat this would cause your partner pain and discomfort instead work with one hand at a time stand behind and slightly to their right place the thumb of your left hand on the right side of their neck wrap your other four fingers around to the left side of their neck to stabilize your thumb s pressure just as you did on the shoulders knead your thumb in circular motions up and down the length of the neck focus attention on any tension knots you encounter when you ve finished the right side of your partner s neck move to stand behind and slightly to the left of them repeat the process with your right thumb on the left side of the neck glide your hands down the sides of the neck it can be difficult to massage the sides of the neck without bothering your partner s throat to do this you will glide your hand in a downward motion from the top of the neck to the front of the shoulder begin on the left side of their body place your left hand on their left shoulder to stabilize them with the fingers on your right hand facing downward place your thumb on the back of the neck and your remaining fingers on the side of it applying pressure glide your hand in a downward motion at the end of the motion your thumb should be on the back of the shoulder and your other fingers should be on the front of the shoulder knead your fingers into any tension points you feel apply pressure to the outsides of the shoulder blades press your fingertips into the shoulder blades and apply firm pressure move your hands in a circular kneading motion to release tension from the muscles in the upper back use the heel of your palm between the shoulder blades because the spine is in the center of the back it can be difficult to massage that area applying focused pressure to the spine will cause pain instead use your palm to apply broad pressure move so you re standing at your partner s side place one hand on the front of their shoulder to stabilize them place the heel of your palm between their shoulder blades apply firm pressure in a long deliberate stroke from one shoulder blade to the other massage just under the collar bone although most of the massage focuses on the shoulders neck and upper back a little attention to the upper chest can help relieve neck pain standing at your partner s side place on hand on their back to stabilize them use your fingertips to rub firmly in circular motions just under their collar bone make sure not to press on the bone itself as this will cause pain massage the upper arms the arms may seem unrelated to the tension felt in the neck and shoulders but they re not the muscles in the arms shoulders and neck all work closely in the movement of the arms so relieving tension in the upper arms will also benefit the neck place your hands on their shoulders applying gentle but firm pressure maintaining that pressure run your hands down from the shoulders to their upper arms then back up repeat this a few times rub up and down the upper arms loosening those muscles cycle through these motions in an un patterned manner if you focus too long on one area with one massaging motion your partner will grow acclimated to the sensation move from muscle group to muscle group and vary your hands motions to make the experience more pleasurable for them the less they can predict the sensations the better the massage will feel the muscles in the shoulders neck back and arms are closely related by paying attention to a wide area of muscles instead of the few muscles that may hurt you are more likely to ease their muscle pain use all parts of your hand many amateur massagers use their thumbs exclusively when giving massages while the thumbs are excellent for focused pressure you can cause pain and discomfort to yourself by over using them instead use all parts of your hand while giving a massage use your thumbs for focused pressure on tension knots use your palms to apply light pressure over larger areas of skin and muscle use your fingertips for firmer pressure use your knuckles on particularly tight muscles do not massage your partner s bones applying pressure to bones the spine especially can cause pain apply pressure only to muscles continue for as long as necessary a massage does not have to be long to be effective a quick five minute massage can make a world of difference but a long massage of half an hour to an hour will make them feel pampered and cared for place your partner in the supine position supine means that he s laying down on their back ideally you can find an elevated surface for them to lay on which allows you to stand or sit in a chair at their head if they lay on the ground you ll have to bend over quite a bit and this could hurt your back tie long hair back so it doesn t hang in your partner s face if they have long hair sweep it back and over the side of the table or bed so you don t accidentally pull it during the massage ask them to either remove their shirt or to wear a top that exposes their chest from the collarbone up you should provide a towel or blanket if he s uncomfortable with exposing their chest choose a massage oil or lotion you can sometimes find massage oils at department stores but if not they can be purchased online some household oils like coconut oil also make wonderful massage oils olive oil almond oil and sesame oil can work well but they tend to be heavy and thick use smaller amounts of these oils for a massage make sure your partner doesn t have any nut allergies before using almond or sesame oil work the oil or lotion through your hands by rubbing them together this warms the product up to make it more comfortable for them warm up gently standing behind their head place the heels of your palms against the sides of the neck use long gentle swedish strokes to apply pressure down the neck and over the shoulders 5 x research source place your thumbs under the neck and run the inside of your index finger down the length of it begin at the ear and work down to where the neck meets the shoulder fan the motion out over their shoulders as well you can use your middle ring and pinky fingers on the front of the shoulders apply more focused pressure to the neck 6 x research source place four fingers under both sides of the neck apply firm pressure running your fingers from the base of the skull to the shoulder loosen the muscles further by pulling your fingers up and away from the table or mat in doing so their head should almost be lifted from the surface repeat this motion with your fingers all along the length of the neck work the neck and shoulders with your thumbs lifting your index through pinky fingers in the air place your thumbs on the sides of the neck just below the ears applying firm pressure glide your thumbs down the sides of the neck slide them over the shoulders all the way to the edges where they meet the arms use the length of your thumb not just the tip this applies diffused pressure rather than focused pressure stay away from the exposed front of the throat applying pressure there will cause a good deal of pain massage the chest the muscles in the front of the chest work in concert with those in the neck so it s important you give them some attention place your thumbs lightly against the back of the shoulders place your other four fingers along the front of the shoulders apply kneading pressure both to the front of the shoulders and to the upper chest under the collarbone make sure not to apply pressure directly to the collarbone or any bone this can be very painful apply rolling pressure under the neck place your index middle and ring fingers under both sides of your partner s neck beginning up by the ears apply pressure in a rolling motion away from the head toward the shoulders be firm but not rough your motion might lift their shoulders a little bit off the surface but they should not be flinching focus on each side of the neck turn their head to the side to expose the side of their neck to you support their head by keeping one hand placed under it when you ve finished working one side of the neck gently turn their head the other way and work the other side with your free hand use your fingertips to apply long firm strokes from the earlobe down to the chest use your thumb to knead the side of the neck in small circles apply deep tissue pressure to the sides of the neck deep tissue techniques can cause pain so you need to be alert to your partner s reactions while doing this however the muscles behind the ears can become very tense so you must apply more intense pressure there to break up the knots for this technique the head should still be turned to the side with one of your hands cradling it from below make a loose fist with your free hand and push the side of your fist into the side of the neck just behind the ear apply intense pressure and move your fist very slowly down the side of your neck work your way down to where the neck meets the chest the intense pressure can be very painful if you move your hand too quickly down the neck so move at a glacial pace be careful to watch for signs of pain deep tissue massage while relaxing in the long run can be uncomfortable in the moment give them a break and have them take deep breaths if they feel pain begin again when he s ready work your fingertips in circular motions behind the ears the muscles behind the ear just below where your head meets your neck tend to grow quite tense return your partner s head to an upright position for this technique so you can work both sides of the neck at the same time place your fingertips on those muscles and apply firm but not painful pressure move your fingertips in a circular motion to break up the tension in that area massage the muscles just above the collarbone you ll feel a small dent right above the collarbone use your fingertips to gently massage the muscles in that area using both circular and kneading motions,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to take your guitar on a plane,if you re worried about whether or not you can take your guitar on a plane or whether it would survive travelling as checked luggage don t worry it s actually your legal right to carry a guitar in the cabin of a plane with no extra fees provided that you follow some guidelines regarding size and safety in order to avoid any at gate arguments you can print out and carry sec 403 of the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 which describes how you are allowed to travel with a guitar on a plane note that there will always be exceptions such as when you re flying on a small plane that just simply doesn t have room onboard for your guitar,book a seat at the back of the plane in order to board first people at the back of the plane usually get to board first so you re less likely to have problems finding space in the overhead bins choose a seat as far back in the plane as is available when you re purchasing your ticket to make the process of storing your guitar onboard easier 1 x research source if you re purchasing an extra seat for your guitar instead of storing it in an overhead luggage compartment it doesn t matter whether the seats are towards the back or not bring your guitar as standard carry on luggage if it fits in an overhead bin sec 403 of the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 permits passengers to carry guitars and other instruments in a plane s cabin as long as it will fit in normal luggage storage bins ensure your guitar is not longer or wider than the airline s overhead bins before you travel with it if you want to carry it on at no extra cost 2 x research source you can call an airline s customer service line to verify the exact overhead bin size for your flight note that there must be space in the overhead bins at the time you board the plane or the airline can require that you check it at the gate flight attendants won t remove other luggage to make space for your guitar try to carry your guitar as discreetly as possible when you re boarding your flight to avoid getting hassled by the agents at the gate ask a flight attendant if you can store your guitar in a coat closet there are often coat closets at the front and back of a plane that flight attendants store things in politely explain to a flight attendant that you re worried about your guitar getting damaged during the flight and ask if there is any extra room in a closet to store it upright 3 x research source you can also try this option if there s no overhead room when you re boarding your flight and the gate attendants are telling you that you can t take your guitar on keep in mind that flight attendants are not required to store your guitar in a closet so if they do so they re doing you a kind favor don t fight with the flight attendants if they won t put it in a closet for you you won t achieve anything this way place your guitar carefully into an overhead bin if you can t put it in a closet head to your seat and put your guitar horizontally into the closest available overhead bin place it on top of other passengers overhead luggage if the bins are already filling up and keep an eye out to make sure nobody puts anything on top of it 4 x research source if you re having trouble fitting your guitar into partially filled luggage bins politely ask nearby passengers if you can accommodate their luggage differently in order to fit your guitar in buy a ticket for your guitar if you can t take it as carry on luggage purchase an additional ticket for an adjacent seat and take your guitar on the plane as if it s a person in the seat next to you this is the only way you re allowed to take a large guitar on a plane with you that is too big to fit in an overhead bin 5 x research source if you aren t sure whether your guitar will fit in an overhead bin this is the safest way to avoid problems when you re boarding the flight naturally this isn t always going to be realistic especially if your flight is expensive other options you can consider are getting a smaller cheaper guitar just for travel or shipping your guitar to your destination use a soft case to make your guitar fit into cabin storage more easily place your guitar in a soft gig style case to minimize its footprint for travel these types of cases don t usually add a lot of bulk so your guitar will still be able to fit into an overhead bin 6 x research source these types of cases will also make your guitar less conspicuous when you carry it on you re less likely to get hassled by a gate attendant or flight attendant while you re bringing it onboard that way if you want a little extra protection you can get a fortified gig case these are still soft but have a little more form and structure to help pad your guitar during its journey keep in mind they are also a little bulkier than totally soft cases your guitar legally must be covered in order for you to take it on a plane as carry on luggage this is required in order to prevent injury to other passengers put your guitar in a hard travel case if you have to put it in the cargo hold choose the hardest sturdiest case possible for your guitar if it s too big to put in an overhead bin and you don t want to pay for an extra seat this will provide the most protection while it s being tossed around by baggage handlers and stored in the hold with other luggage 7 x research source for example if you called your airline and found out that your guitar is too big for your flight s overhead bins or if you re flying on a small commuter plane put it in a hard case if you plan to fly with your guitar a lot invest in a heavy duty flight case these cases are expensive but they are made of very hard reinforced materials and have a lot of foam padding for maximum protection pack your guitar with paper to fill extra space and stop it from moving loosen the strings slightly and put crumpled up newspaper or packing paper in between the strings and the fretboard wrap newspaper or packing paper around the headstock neck and heel to protect them fill in any empty spaces in the case with paper as well 8 x research source you could also use soft items of clothing like t shirts instead of paper doing so can even save you a little room in your other luggage bubble wrap would also work well for this avoid putting any prohibited objects inside your guitar case with the guitar remove anything from the case that is not allowed inside a plane s cabin don t put anything in the case that you wouldn t put in a normal piece of carry on luggage to avoid problems with airport security 9 x research source for example anything sharp bottles of liquids over 3 oz 88 7 ml and lighters are things that are prohibited from plane cabins ensure the total weight of your guitar is within the airline s limit the standard cabin luggage weight limit is 165 lb 75 kg so your guitar won t be overweight for a standard commercial flight weigh your guitar in its case to make sure that it falls under the airline s weight limit if your flight has a lower limit 10 x research source you can call your airline s customer service line ahead of time or look on their website to find the exact weight restrictions for your specific flight you are probably only likely to have problems with weight if you are flying on an extremely small plane since no guitars weigh anywhere near 165 lb 75 kg,Personal-Care-and-Style

thin layer onto your nail let the base coat dry for about 5 minutes before you put on your actual nail polish color 3 x research source base coats provide a smooth even base layer for the nail polish to adhere to using a base coat will also make your nail polish last longer work in a cool dry environment the heat from your body can radiate outwards and cause your nail polish to bubble up if it gets too warm try to paint your nails in a cool dry place where you aren t sweaty or clammy 4 x research source if it s hot out run your hands under cold water to cool them down before you start roll the nail polish bottle in between your hands instead of shaking it when you shake your nail polish you create small air bubbles that you might not even be able to see until you apply it if your nail polish has separated roll it gently in between your palms while keeping the bottle upright to combine the ingredients 5 x research source if you do shake your nail polish let it settle for about 30 minutes before you put it on put on thin layers of polish instead of one thick layer when you start applying your nail polish do one thin coat on top of the base coat thick nail polish is more likely to bubble up while thin nail polish stays smooth and shiny 6 x research source applying multiple thin layers takes longer than doing one thick one but it s the best way to get rid of air bubbles in the polish use smooth even strokes to paint your nails as you apply your polish keep the brush level with your nail and try not to jerk it up or to the side cover your nail in as few strokes as possible to avoid overlapping the polish and creating a thick layer that can trap air bubbles 7 x research source think about lifting the brush as little as possible for a smooth even coat dip the brush into the polish once not repeatedly dunking your brush in and out of the nail polish can inject air bubbles into it leading to bumpy uneven application instead try to dip your brush into the nail polish as little as possible using one fluid motion to do it that way you won t be pushing air back into the bottle every time you need to reapply 8 x research source it s the same reason you aren t supposed to dunk your mascara wand into the mascara tube repeatedly adding air dries out your product and creates bubbles let the first coat dry completely whatever you do don t touch your nails until they re dry if your polish is not quick drying it could take up to 30 minutes for the first coat to dry try not to wave your hands back and forth as this can create air bubbles as well 9 x research source letting the first coat dry completely will create a better base for the final coat and it will make your nail polish smooth and shiny if you are using a quick dry polish your nails might be dry in about 5 minutes smooth on a second coat to enhance the color using the same short even strokes that you did for the first coat apply another coat to make your nails shine again try to lift up the brush as little as possible to coat your entire nail in an even layer 10 x research source some lighter colors like pastels or neons may need a third coat for full coverage close the lid tightly to keep it airtight when you re done painting your nails screw the lid on as tightly as you can this will keep air from entering the polish while it s in storage to reduce the amount of air bubbles 11 x research source closing the lid tightly will also keep your nail polish from drying out store your nail polish in a cool dry place although it can be convenient to keep your nail polish in the bathroom the heat and humidity from the shower can make your nail polish warm up and create bubbles try keeping your polish in a cabinet outside the bathroom in your closet or in a drawer 12 x research source if you live in a humid climate try installing a dehumidifier in your home if you re using polish that s been stored in a warm environment try placing it in the fridge for 30 minutes before you use it to cool it down replace your nail polish after 1 year old nail polish can get thick as it ages which makes it harder to see the air bubbles and avoid them if your nail polish is more than 1 year old pick out a new bottle of nail polish so that it s thin and you can see where the air bubbles are 13 x research source if you want to thin out a bottle of old nail polish add 1 to 2 drops of nail polish remover to the bottle then stir it up however this may make the nail polish chip faster as it weakens the bond between the polish and your nail,Personal-Care-and-Style

and 2 parts of 20 volume developer mix it together with the back of a hair color brush until the bleach is creamy without any lumps 8 x research source the higher volume developer will counteract the darker spots of your hair and it will work on any natural growth you have you can find bleach and developer at most beauty supply stores if all of your hair is previously dyed meaning you don t have any root grow out stick with a 10 volume developer for your whole head to avoid any unnecessary damage mix bleach with 10 volume developer for the lighter spots in a separate plastic bowl scoop out 1 part of bleach and 2 parts of 10 volume developer stir the two together with the back of a hair color brush until they re smooth and creamy 9 x research source this lower developer mixture will be less harsh on the hair that was previously dyed so it won t be as damaging you may want to label each bowl so you don t get them confused when it s time to use them separate your hair into 4 even sections brush through your hair again and make sure it s dry and clean without any tangles section it into 4 vertical sections 1 on either side of your face and 2 in the back and keep them separated with clips or hair ties 10 x research source if you have super short hair you don t need to section it out before you start pick out a thin piece of 1 section and place a foil underneath it unclip one section and start from the very bottom of your hair using the back of your hair color brush pick out a section of hair that s about 1 cm 0 39 in thick then use a clip to pin up the rest of the section place a strip of aluminum foil underneath the small section of hair you just picked out 11 x research source taking small sections of hair will take a super long time but it will ensure that your hair gets fully saturated in bleach for an even color paint the lower developer onto the ends of your hair put on gloves to protect your hands and scoop out the bleach mixed with 10 volume developer with a hair color brush paint it onto the ends of your hair where it s lighter and more damaged being sure to saturated all of the strands completely 12 x research source sometimes the ends of your hair are actually darker than the middle or the top if that s true for you you can use a higher developer on the ends and a lower developer on any spots that are lighter putting the lower developer on first will give it more time to process and lighten your hair use the higher developer on the roots and darker spots sticking with the same section of hair on the foil use a different hair color brush to paint on the 20 volume developer mixture onto the darker spots of your hair try not to get the bleach onto your roots just yet since those process faster than the rest of your hair 13 x research source try not to put any of the higher developer mixture onto lighter spots if you do you could damage or break your hair fold the hair into the foil grab the end of the foil and fold it upward so the hair is trapped in the middle crease the edge of the foil so that it stays put on its own to trap in the heat and make the hair process faster 14 x research source foils will also help you keep track of what hair you ve already put bleach on continue working through each section with the bleach now you can continue to pick out very thin sections of hair using foils and the 2 bleach mixtures on each one work all the way around your head from the back to the front until your hair is fully saturated in bleach 15 x research source depending on how long and thick your hair is this could take up to 1 hour or more if you re having trouble seeing the back of your head set up 1 mirror in front of you and 1 in back go back and cover your roots with the 10 volume mixture using a hair coloring brush again paint the lower volume bleach onto your roots to lighten them up as well since your roots lighten fairly quickly they don t need the strong bleach 16 x research source if you bleach your roots along with the rest of your hair they could lighten way faster leading to lighter roots and darker ends or hot roots if you were planning on leaving your roots your natural color you don t have to bleach them this can help you achieve a more natural or grown out look if that s what you re going for rinse the bleach out with lukewarm water after 30 to 45 minutes head to the sink and take out all of the foils from your hair rinse your hair in lukewarm water until you can t feel the bleach on your hair anymore 17 x research source try not to leave the bleach on your hair for longer than 45 minutes or you could damage your hair since your hair is previously lightened the bleach will probably work very quickly check on your hair every 10 minutes to see when you need to rinse it out do another round of bleach if your hair is still really dark sometimes one round of bleach might not be enough to fully remove the brown from your hair if your hair is still orange or brown try doing a second bleach process with the same application you did before however if your hair feels extremely dry brittle or damaged do not bleach it again to avoid getting breakage 18 x research source remember the more you bleach your hair the more damaged it will be if you aren t sure that your hair can handle another round of bleach don t do it paint on a root shadow color for a natural look mix together 1 part beige toner 1 part ash toner and a 5 volume developer paint this formula onto the first 1 to 2 inches 2 5 to 5 1 cm of your hair to give your color more depth and make your hair look fuller 19 x research source you don t have to add a root shadow but it will make your blonde look a little more natural and blend the grow out over time cancel out the orange or yellow tones in your hair with an ash toner pour 1 part ash toner and 1 part developing lotion into a plastic bowl then mix the two together paint the toner onto your hair from the ends to the roots stopping when you hit your root shadow color 20 x research source toner helps to counteract any brassy tones in your hair leaving you with a cool more platinum blonde toners often have different levels the darker your hair is the lower the level you should buy for example if your hair is orange go for a level 5 toner if it s yellow try a level 7 or 8 toner rinse the color out of your hair after 20 minutes head to the sink again and rinse your hair out with lukewarm water make sure all of the toner and root shadow color is out of your hair before moving on 21 x research source your hair will look darker when it s wet so don t assess the color until it s fully dry use a hair mask or a deep conditioner to repair any damage bleach can be very dry and damaging to your hair so use a moisturizing hair mask or a deep conditioner on the ends of your wet hair to counteract it leave the mask or conditioner in for about 1 hour then rinse it out with lukewarm water 22 x research source if you re going to use heat

apart using your finger tips slide it over the knot in your beard and on top of the wraps you made then slip your fingers out 5 x research source any small elastic hair band will work for this avoid using any hair band that you have to twist and double up in order to make it tight enough this will add unnecessary bulk that will make the knot harder to tuck you could stop here if you just want to keep your beard in a little bun style knot however if you want a neater look continue to tuck it make space in your beard behind the knot using your thumbs and tuck it press both of your thumbs into your beard behind the knot and spread it to the sides to create a little nest for the knot use one of your thumbs to push the knot inside the space you created while holding it open with the other thumb then remove both thumbs 6 x research source you should now look like you have a shorter beard if the tucked knot feels or looks too bulky in the middle of your beard you can try sliding it over to 1 side of your chin inside your beard feel free to play around with the positioning of the tucked knot to find what works best for you slide a hair tie over the middle of your beard to keep it

beard for a bushier look pinch your beard together tightly about 2 3 of the way towards the bottom tip slide a hair tie over it and twist and double up the hair tie 2 3 times until it is nice and tight 8 x research source this is another way you can quickly tie your long beard up to get it out of the way while you re traveling or doing something outside on a windy day this technique is similar to putting a hair tie loosely in the middle of your beard but the upper section will look bigger and bushier while the lower section will be more neat and tight fold your beard back and up and put a hair tie on it to tie it up while you sleep slip a hair tie around one of your wrists use both hands to bunch up your beard then flip the bottom half up behind the top half and hold it in place slide the hair tie off your wrist and onto the middle of your folded beard to keep it like that 9 x research source this is great for when you re sleeping because it keeps you from tugging on your beard while you roll around at night twist your beard and slide a ring over it for a unique look choose a decorative ring such as a chunky metal ring with a bright stone in the middle twist the bottom 1 3 or so of your beard until it is thin enough to slide the ring over then slip it through the ring and let go of your beard so it untwists itself and fills in the ring 10 x research source you can add to this look by sliding a tiny rubber hair band over the bottom tip of your beard this will tighten up the bottom underneath the ring for a neater style you could also try dividing your beard in half down the middle and putting a ring on each side for a variation on this look tie a ribbon into a bow in your beard for a fun festive style wrap a ribbon of the color of your choice around the middle of your beard starting at the back tie the ribbon into a neat bow facing towards the front 11 x research source for example you could tie your beard up with a shiny red or green bow for a holiday party braid your beard for a cool woven look separate your beard into 3 equal sections and put a small rubber hair band around the tip of each section cross 1 of the outside sections over the middle section then cross the opposite outside section over the middle repeat the weaving pattern until you braid your beard down to the bottom then slide a hair band over the tip of the braid to keep it tight 12 x research source you can try different styles of beard braiding to achieve different looks for example you could braid just the bottom half to keep the top half looking bushy braid the entire thing more tightly for a neater look or even do 2 separate braids,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to stretch a leather bag,a professional leather repair shop should have no problem stretching your bag out this is the safest way to make a leather bag bigger but you can certainly save some money stretching it at home realistically the solutions here may expand the leather 1 8 1 in 0 32 2 54 cm but you aren t going to double the size of the bag or anything like that keep in mind since the process for stretching leather does not stretch out other fabrics the same way these solutions will not make the inside of your bag bigger if there s a tight fabric lining inside,find a pillow that is slightly larger than the inside of your bag look around your home for a throw pillow couch pillow or some small cushion that is roughly 1 4 inches 2 5 10 2 cm bigger than your bag on each side if your bag is really big you may be able to use a standard pillow for this if you have multiple pillows that will work use the stiffest pillow available 1 x research source you can line the bag with a shirt or towel and add the pillow after to make the interior of the bag a little smaller if you don t have a perfect pillow for this empty your bag to avoid odd indentations or uneven stretching open the bag and take everything out look inside each smaller compartment and run your hand along the interior lining of the bag to make sure you got everything if you stretch the bag with something inside of it it may cause the leather to stretch in a weird way or leave a mark on the leather 3 x research source stuff the pillow inside the bag and zip it up if possible compress the pillow in your hands and push it inside of your bag tuck the corners of the pillow into the corners of the bag and line it up so that the pillow is sitting evenly inside of the bag if you have a zipper push the pillow down a little and zip the bag if you can 4 x research source if the pillow is pushing on the bag so hard that you can t zip the bag don t try to zip it shut you re just going to break the bag if you close it when it s stuffed too full zipping the bag isn t mandatory for this to work anyway so it s not worth risking it let the bag sit with the pillow inside for 1 3 days to stretch it out set the bag in your closet or some other place where it won t get damaged or in your way let the pillow sit inside of the bag to stretch the leather out gently over time the pillow will slowly force the leather to expand and your bag may get a little bigger 5 x research source you may need to keep the pillow inside of the bag for much longer if you aren t seeing any results realistically you can leave the pillow inside for as long as you want let the bag rest for 2 3 months if you don t need it right away and want to stretch it as wide as you can pick up a leather stretching spray designed for shoes go online or stop by your local shoe store and pick up a bottle of leather stretching spray this spray is typically designed for shoes but there s no reason it won t work on a leather bag 6 x research source expect to spend 5 15 on a leather stretching spray you can use a leather conditioning spray instead if you simply want to soften the leather up this may make your bag feel bigger without stretching the material too much stuff the bag with a pillow or newspaper to expand the leather you aren t going to stretch the leather out very much if you don t stuff the bag with something to keep the material spread out either tuck a pillow inside of the bag or ball up enough newspaper to fill the bag entirely zip the bag if you have a zipper 7 x research source shake the stretching spray and spritz the first side of your bag shake the stretching spray back and forth for 5 10 seconds to mix the ingredients up and activate the spray take the cap of the spray off and hold the nozzle 5 8 inches 13 20 cm from the side of your bag spray your bag back and forth to cover the entire side of the bag 8 x research source you can spray and buff each side of the bag separately or coat the bag entirely in the spray and wipe it down all at once do whatever is easier for you work the spray into the leather by rubbing it with a microfiber cloth grab a dry clean microfiber cloth and gently work the leather stretching spray into the surface of the leather use firm circular motions and back and forth strokes to work the spray into the leather continue wiping until there is no leather stretching spray visibly sitting on the surface of the bag 9 x research source repeat this process on the other sides of the bag and let the leather air dry continue spritzing and buffing the surface of the bag until you ve worked the spray into every portion of the bag let the leather air dry and keep the newspaper or pillow inside the bag for 1 3 hours remove the pillow or newspaper after you re done to finish stretching the bag 10 x research source you may need to repeat this process multiple times to see any results fill a small bin with a 1 1 solution of rubbing alcohol and water grab a small bucket or storage bin that is big enough to submerge your straps fill it up 1 3 of the way with rubbing alcohol then fill another 1 3 of the container with regular tap water use a wooden spoon or mixing stick to mix the solution together 11 x research source this will work but it may wash out any dyes or ink on your bag if your handles have any patterns or colors on them this is likely not a good idea soak the handles in the solution for 15 30 seconds empty your bag out entirely and flip it upside down lower the straps under the surface of the solution use your spoon or mixing stick to push the straps down if they won t stay under the surface keep the straps submerged for 15 30 seconds to give the solution time to soak through 12 x research source lift the bag out and hang it by the straps with a heavy object inside pull the bag up out of the solution and wait 5 10 seconds for the excess alcohol and water to drip off into the bucket then hang the bag on a hook or tension rod over a sink tub or bucket set a 5 10 lb 2 3 4 5 kg brick weight or other heavy object inside of the bag to weigh it down 13 x research source let the bag hang and air dry for 8 12 hours to stretch it out wait for the heavy object to stretch the leather out after the alcohol has softened it up keep it on the hook or tension rod for half a day or so after the bag is completely dry take it down and enjoy your newly stretched out handles 14 x research source,Personal-Care-and-Style
how to adjust a backpack,whether you re hiking going to school or just trying to move something important backpacks are invaluable however dealing with all the straps and belt buckles can be a little trickier than you expect hiking backpacks have the most adjustable straps but even smaller work and school bags have some of the same features with proper adjustments you can carry a backpack for longer with minimal strain on your neck and back,pack the backpack before attempting to adjust it the weight distribution in the pack makes a big difference in how the pack fits your body place lighter gear at the bottom such as a sleeping bag clothing or light books place heavier gear on top of it in the backpack s center and closer to your body you can then place the lightest gear on top 1 x research source if you re testing a backpack s fit at least fill it with some weight a lighter backpack feels much different than a full one and you won t be able to adjust it accurately until you actually put it to use if you re going on a trip wait to adjust the backpack until you have finished packing it when you re wearing it check the weight distribution to ensure it isn t throwing you off balance loosen all straps on the backpack disconnect any buckles that will get in your way such as the ones on the hip and sternum straps then to loosen the straps find the buckles on each one pull each strap back through the buckles until you re able to squeeze underneath the backpack s shoulder pads 2 x research source for example the shoulder straps will have buckles near the bottom of the shoulder pads pick up the tail ends of the straps and move them back toward the top part of the backpack fit the backpack over your shoulders lift it to slip your head between the shoulder pads it won t fit perfectly at this point but it doesn t have to just make sure it feels comfortable on your body and not too heavy 3 x research source a good backpack will be the same length as your torso it should span from the base of your neck to your waist if yours is the wrong size it may be uncomfortable even after you finish adjusting it check the backpack s weight distribution as well if you feel it pulling you backward rearranging or removing some stuff may help position the straps on your shoulders and waist move the shoulder pads between your neck and shoulders they should be spaced the same distance from your neck and wrap comfortably around the tops of your shoulders fit the waist belt near your hips make sure all of the other straps are accessible near your sides 4 x research source both shoulder pads are meant to be used on all backpacks including shoulder backpacks if you only use one pad the backpack s won t be well balanced and it will put a lot of strain on your neck and back place the waist belt padding on top of your hips grab onto the ends of the waist belt at the bottom of the backpack pull both ends forward so they are in front of your stomach before securing the belt raise it as needed so it rests comfortably over your hips 5 x research source the pads won t close together instead they will end above your legs leaving a gap between them snap the buckle halves together to secure the belt the buckle halves are on the ends of the waist belt pull both halves toward the center of your body to join them together keep the buckle in front of your body it won t be very tight yet but it should still be centered over your stomach 6 x research source let the belt buckle hang off of your waist until you finish tightening the strap if it isn t below your waist before then check the belt s positioning to make sure it is correct tighten the waist belt by pulling the strap ends use the loose straps hanging from the buckle halves pull them away from the buckle at the same time so the belt tightens evenly continue pulling the belt tighter until it rests lightly against your abs it shouldn t press against your body or otherwise limit your range of motion 7 x research source make sure the belt isn t pinching you if it feels too tight feed the straps back through the buckles to fit the waist belt properly try shrugging your shoulders tighten the belt while your shoulders are up when you lower them the belt will drop down as well to rest over your hips pull the shoulder straps down until they are flat against your body look along the bottom edge of each shoulder pad for a loose strap grab onto the straps and pull them straight down at the same time lowering the pads this way tightens them at the same time pull them down until they are about level with your armpits 8 x research source the shoulder straps should still feel comfortable so loosen them if they pinch your back or shoulders push the straps back through the buckles to release some of the pressure if your backpack is the right size for your body the straps will follow the shape of your shoulders get a different backpack size if you notice space between the padding and your shoulders move the load lifter straps over your shoulders the load lifter straps are on the top part of the backpack which will be behind your head take one in each hand and gently pull them forward at the same time position them on top of the shoulder straps 9 x research source test the straps by taking a few steps forward if you feel yourself being pulled back by the backpack s weight the straps may not be tight enough adjust the load lifter straps until the backpack is tight against your body check your balance after adjusting the straps if you feel like the backpack is pulling you backward then the load lifter straps may not be tight enough make them so the top part of the backpack is vertical parallel with your head to loosen the straps push them back through the buckles 10 x research source as a rule of thumb the load lifters form a 45 degree angle with the top of your shoulders it isn t easy to see while you re wearing the backpack so use a mirror or have someone else check it for you pull the sternum strap across your chest the final strap is the one right below your neckline look for the loose ends of the strap hanging from the shoulder pads pull them towards one another at the same time keep the strap about 1 in 2 5 cm below your collarbone 11 x research source note how pulling the sternum strap relieves some of the pressure from the shoulder strap if the straps feel too tight against your body go back and loosen the shoulder straps first snap the belt buckle halves together to secure the strap each end of the sternum strap will have half of the buckle after fitting them together rest the buckle flat against your body position the strap along the top part of your chest with the buckle in the center 12 x research source make sure the buckle is well secured and out of the way of your arms try swinging your arms a few times to test if the strap restricts your range of motion if the strap feels restrictive undo the belt buckle check that is it positioned below your collarbone but not as low as your armpits pull the strap tight until the backpack rests against your shoulders the sternum strap pulls the shoulder pads closer together as you pull the tail end of the strap toward one side it will relieve some of the pressure on your body make sure the strap is well secured but not able to constrict your movement or breathing if you need to loosen it by feeding the strap back through the buckle 13 x research source if you feel a little uncomfortable at this point you can go back to the shoulder straps and loosen them a little further the sternum strap affects the shoulder straps a little bit so you may have to make further adjustments to them always do the sternum strap last even though you may feel tempted to take care of them when tightening the shoulder straps you won t get the best possible fit that way,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to spot fake louis vuitton purses,when you re buying an expensive name brand purse like a louis vuitton it is important to know you re getting the real deal the stamps and pattern on a louis vuitton bag are often good indicators of its authenticity looking at other minor details such as the hardware and stitching can also help you to spot a fake or real bag make sure to research the seller as well to see if they seem trustworthy before you buy your bag,locate the made in stamp imprinted in the leather on the bag authentic louis vuitton bags always include a stamp that says louis vuitton and made in france or another country if it was made elsewhere underneath it if your bag is missing this stamp then it is likely a fake look for the stamp pressed directly into the leather of your bag the stamp should include certain features which will indicate its authenticity these include 1 x research source a short leg the bottom of the ls os that are round and bigger than the l ts that are so close they appear to be touching lettering that is thin and crisp check to see if the bag s date code matches the made in stamp look for the date code inside of the bag right along the top edge of the bag s opening the date code should include 2 letters and a 4 digit number the first 2 numbers in the 4 digit number indicate the week of the year and the second 2 indicate the year the letters indicate where the bag was made if the letters in the date code indicate a different country than the made in stamp then the bag is likely a fake 2 x research source be aware that bags made prior to 1980 will not have a date code so this will not help you to authenticate a vintage bag 3 x research source there are many different letter codes to indicate the region of a country that the bag was made in so you might have to look up the code to figure out if it matches the made in stamp for example mi sd th and vi are all letter codes for different regions of france ensure that the pattern is even throughout the bag the bag s print should be a mirror image of itself going all the way across the bag if a circle design is cut off on 1 side then it should be cut off at exactly the same point on the other side of the bag the pattern should also look straight never at an angle or crooked 4 x research source note that if the logo is hidden or cut off any where it is likely a knockoff the other designs on a louis vuitton bag might be cut off at some places but the lv logo will not be cut off on an authentic bag 5 x research source look for upside down lv s on the back of the bag since louis vuitton uses one continuous strip of leather to make bags the lv logos should appear right side up on the front side of the bag and upside down on the backside of the bag if the bag was not made from 1 continuous strip or if the lv logos are right side up on both sides of the bag then it is likely a fake 6 x research source keep in mind that this only applies to louis vuitton bags that feature the logo on them if your bag lacks this then it won t be a reliable way to authenticate the bag examine the overall quality of the bag s hardware and zipper the hardware and zipper should be real metal with a gold coating on them there should not be any discoloration or tarnish on the metal it should look shiny and bright if the hardware is plastic or if it looks tarnished it s likely a knockoff bag some other hardware features to look for include 7 x research source clean precise printing on the hardware you should be able to easily make out the words louis vuitton on the bag s zipper pull and other hardware features lv logos printed on the snaps if the bag has snaps if the bag has snaps but they don t have a logo on them then it is likely a fake look for a patina on the bag s handles if it s vintage over time a louis vuitton s handles will change from a bright white color to a brown or even a brownish red this is a result of the leather oxidizing and absorbing oils from the owner s skin as they handle the bag the change in color is called the patina it s a normal part of the leather s aging process if you find a bag that is marketed as vintage and does not have a patina then it is likely a fake 8 x research source for example if the bag was supposedly made in the 1990s then the handles should be a deep shade of brown if they are still a light tan or white then the bag is a fake look for 5 mustard yellow stitches across the top of each handle louis vuitton ensures that their bags have this number of stitches and they use a mustard yellow thread to sew them so more or less than 5 stiches or a different color of thread would be a dead giveaway that the bag is a fake 9 x research source for example if the thread is brown or black it s likely a fake the stitching should look very neat and even as well if the stitching is sloppy the bag is likely a knockoff 10 x research source inspect the interior lining to see if it s brown canvas knock offs use cheap plastic or suede to line their bags however an authentic louis vuitton will be lined with a brown canvas material 11 x research source depending on the specific design a real louis vuitton bag may be lined with other textiles such as cross grain leather polyester or microfiber suede research the seller before you buy this is especially important if you re purchasing a bag from an online auction or through a similar online venue check the seller s feedback to see how their other customers have rated their products look for sellers with an overwhelmingly large percentage of positive feedback comments 12 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source avoid sellers with negative feedback zero feedback or private feedback avoid sellers who have a no return policy as this indicates that they don t guarantee the quality of their products be wary of sellers offering a bag at a considerably discounted price a legitimate bag that retails in the hundreds would not sell for less than 100 especially not a new bag this means that if the bag you find is supposed to be new and it s selling for a low price it is probably a knockoff 14 x research source you can find used louis vuitton bags for less than brand new ones but these bags may also be quite expensive if they are rare or coveted by collectors avoid sellers offering wholesale or closeout bags any seller who claims to have bags from a wholesale list or closeout liquidation is likely to be selling fakes louis vuitton does not discount have outlets or sell wholesale any seller who claims otherwise should not be trusted if you encounter a seller claiming to have bags from a closeout or wholesale then the bags are likely to be fake 15 x research source also don t buy louis vuitton purses from street vendors since the company does not permit street vendors to carry their merchandise these bags are most likely fake,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to spot a fake coach bag,due to their popularity designer bags are often replicated and coach bags are no exception knowing how to spot a fake bag can be extremely helpful if you re looking to purchase one outside of a department store or the official coach website being aware of a few coach specifics like patterns logos and identification can help spare you a lot of wasted money and future trouble,examine the craftsmanship there should be little wear to the bag and the material should be sturdy coach products are made from expensive and authentic materials for example they use real high quality leather so if the bag appears overly smooth and plastic y or seems to be made from canvas it s likely to be made from a synthetic like pleather which would make it a fake 1 x research source if the bag is flimsy or it appears to stretch a lot these are also red flags look at the stitching the seams and stitching of coach bags are even and clean each stitch should be the exact same length they should also be straight and not over stitched i e stitches sewn over an edge to prevent fraying or loosening this means you will see only one line of thread not multiples stitched over each other 2 x research source check the lining most coach purses will have a solid color satin lining however bags without the cc print on the exterior may have it on the interior instead this may not always be the case though as some bags may not have the cc pattern on either the outside or the inside keep in mind that a coach bag should never have the cc pattern on both the inside and outside look at the cc pattern bags with the signature c design follow a very set arrangement for example both cs should be horizontal facing each other and touching they should also start in the center of the front panel on the bag and be structured to where you could cut the bag in half down the middle and have matching patterns on each side 3 x research source there should also be no breaks in the pattern even at the seams and pockets 4 x research source bags with the c pattern are usually the ones that are faked so be sure to inspect the bag carefully there shouldn t just be cs all over the place also make sure the cs are actually cs and not gs from a distance the difference may not be noticeable look for labels labels are commonly found on the hardware outside of the bag and on the inside of the bag for example each bag should come with the coach leather creed which is a leather patch embossed on the inside containing the bag s serial number if there isn t a leather patch the serial number for the bag should at least be stamped on the inside not printed 5 x research source keep in mind that some coach bags like the clutch swingpack and mini will not have a serial number bags from the 1960s will also not have a serial number and bags from the 1970s and 1980s will have a serial number with only numbers not letters and numbers like current bags 6 x research source a few coach bags such as those in the legacy series will have their serial numbers stamped and inked in a gold tone ink if the number is only inked that s a red flag check the logo tags many coach purses also come with logo tags these are leather tags attached to the purse with a beaded chain the trim of the tag should match the trim on the bag and the coach logo should be raised not imprinted 7 x research source take a look at the zippers zippers on a real coach bag will have a pull made of either leather or rings some but not all coach bags will also have the letters ykk engraved into the metal of the zipper pulls made of another material are typically indicators of a fake 8 x research source compare the bag to pictures on the coach website if anything about the bag seems off to you comparing it to an image of an authentic version is a good idea it can help you determine where the labels should be on that particular bag as well as how the bag should look what the pattern should be the inside lining and the logo tags determine if the deal is too good to be true while they aren t the most expensive bags comparatively coach bags can still be anywhere between 200 600 even the used bags can retail for a hefty price if a new coach bag is selling for a cheap price that s a good sign that it s a fake keep in mind the actual pricing of the bag you want and compare it the one you re considering buying are they similar 9 x research source pay close attention to the vendor if a vendor avoids your questions looks guilty or gives vague answers when you ask about the authenticity of a bag it s a good sign that you should be wary ask if they accept returns if they don t they may not be credible if the vendor has a lot of the same type of bag this is also a red flag as it usually means they re replicas inspect the material in this instance are the bags made of fabric or cheap leather if the seller is advertising coach bags that are labeled as designer inspired or grade a replicas they re fake this

certificate of authenticity your versace bag will also come with a small white piece of paper stating that it is authentic the text varies but the writing itself is always in black the certificate is often placed in the inside of the bag near the main label 3 x research source find the two production stickers you should find both stickers located in the interior of the bag one will show the country of the sale so a u s sticker for an american retail sale the second sticker will state that the bag was produced in italy the printing on the stickers should be clear and not blurry 4 x research source if there is a possibility that you will return this bag make sure to keep these stickers intact and in place request an authenticity guarantee most sellers will provide you with a separate written guarantee stating that everything sold in their shop is authentic and legitimate you can also visit a store s website and look over their sales policies be wary of accepting a simple verbal guarantee or an informal written notice 5 x research source compare your bag to the official versace website go to the main versace website and browse around to find a digital image of the bag that you are interested in if the bag is vintage then browse the internet and locate at least a few comparison images get the photos and do a one on one comparison paying particular attention to small

should not move or be attached to the bag with glue if you are buying online ask for a close up photo of the hardware and where it meets the bag any designs on the hardware will likely be etched into the surface not printed look over the seams and stitching the stitching should be even barely noticeable and straight glance over the stitching to see if you notice any loose or frayed seams as that is a sign of a fake bag the seams on an authentic bag may also be protected with a light wax casing which is sometimes removable post purchase 9 x research source the threads should all be the same color unless they are purposefully contrasted pull very gently at the sides of the bag where the seams are located they should not give at all which is a sign of durability smell it if your bag is

fragrances that touch your new bag may be absorbed 10 x research source pay attention to packaging if you buy your bag new from a store or online it may come in a box with a dust bag the bag is used for storing the bag when not in use the hardware of the versace bag itself will not be covered with plastic or another layer this is a common sign of a counterfeit 11 x research source look for a clear logo on the bag or box the versace logo should be consistent across all of the packing materials and markings on the bag itself look for a crisp clear logo on all printed materials and etching instead of printing on the handbag 12 x research source buy directly from a versace store or outlet this is the best way to buy a legitimate versace bag you can find a location of a store near you by going to the versace website there are primary stores and outlets selling older season merchandise as well or you could buy a bag directly from versace online if you decide to the buy the online route it may be a good idea to at least visit a store in person to look at the bags firsthand 13 x research source try to stay away from generic designer bag outlets these stores whether online or in person are often not affiliated with the brand itself this makes it more difficult to determine authenticity buy from a high rated online seller you want to find a seller who has been in business for a while and who has gotten a good number of positive reviews on sites such as ebay look for narrative reviews that describe how the quality of the bag matched up to the photos provided it is also a good idea to buy from a site where the sellers are held accountable for negative reviews 14 x research source check out the seller s website if you are looking for the main versace website pay attention to the final url to make sure that you ve reached the correct site sometimes fake bag sellers will use websites with typos or other subtle errors you should also click on each of the website s links and portals to make sure that they are accessible and accurate 15 x research source for example a blank support page is a clear red flag that the site may be trafficking in fake goods ask the seller questions whether you buy in person or online a seller should be able to answer any questions that you have about the versace bag ask about the sources of their bags ask about how long they ve been in business discuss any warranties and the return policies keep asking questions until you feel comfortable with your purchase 16 x research source ask for more photos start off by saying that the photos they ve provided are good but you d like just a few more images request that the photos show specific parts of the bag such as the zipper areas or the threading at the bottom of the bag request both close and distance shots 17 x research source check to make sure that the photos you ve been given are not on another website or elsewhere also look for signs of doctoring such as blurry spots or obscured areas pay attention to your instincts there are many ways to purchase a versace bag and it is best to pause for a moment if you have any doubts about the seller bag or price if the purchase price seems unbelievable it should arouse your suspicions and require some extra checking just wait a bit and continue to do your research consider your efforts as an investment toward making a good final purchase versace does have seasonal sales but these deals will not generally lower the price of a bag by half or more when in doubt contact a versace store directly to ask for a price comparison 18 x research source if a seller mentions that the bag is cheaper due to a flaw this is likely not the case many brands such as versace will destroy flawed bags instead of selling them,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to tell if a handbag is genuine crocodile,if you re in the market for a genuine crocodile handbag you may wish to know how to tell crocodile leather from stamped or embossed leather additionally you might be wondering how to tell the difference between crocodile and alligator or caiman don t worry you don t have to be an expert to identify crocodile leather spend some time inspecting the leather and the distribution of scales to help you determine whether or not the handbag is made from genuine crocodile,be wary of an abrupt transition in the size and shape of the scales crocodiles have scales that gradually transition from large square shapes on their bellies to smaller more rounded shapes on their sides if the change is abrupt if it switches more than twice in a single panel or if there is no transition the bag is likely made from stamped leather 1 x research source look for an irregular grain pattern look closely and carefully at the grain pattern on the handbag the pattern of the grain on a crocodile leather handbag will have some irregularities as each scale will be of a slightly different shape and size there may also be small uneven lines present at the base of the scales if the grain pattern of the scales is very uniform it has probably been stamped on determine if it is crocodile by the feel and flexibility of the bag run your fingers over the bag and pay attention to the softness and flexibility of the leather crocodile bags are soft smooth and supple stamped or embossed leather bags are more compact and rigid than genuine crocodile leather 2 x research source examine the tag to find out if the handbag is crocodile leather it s not enough for the tag to say genuine leather as this won t tell you what kind of leather it is and genuine leather is actually the lowest quality leather instead look for a tag that states that the handbag has been crafted from crocodile 3 x research source the tag may even say full grain leather meaning the grain

paperwork they are likely selling embossed or stamped leather bags 6 x research source identify alligator and crocodile leather by its softness both crocodile and alligator leather are soft and supple caiman leather however is more rough and rigid simply run your fingers along the leather to determine if it is soft meaning it s alligator or crocodile or rough meaning it s likely caiman 7 x research source look for cracks to identify caiman leather bend the leather to determine its flexibility alligator and crocodile leather are more pliable than caiman if you see lots of light cracks when you bend the leather it is probably made from caiman which is the lowest quality reptile leather 8 x research source see if the dye is absorbed smoothly and uniformly into the leather alligator and crocodile hides are softer than caiman so the dye is absorbed smoothly and uniformly into the leather there shouldn t be any areas that are darker or lighter than others caiman leather that has been dyed is likely to look blotchy due to the rougher texture 9 x research source look for a 4 2 pattern of horned bumps if the leather used is from the back rather than the belly of the animal you can determine which reptile it came from based on the number and pattern of horned bumps present in addition to the flat scales there will be a few horned bumps in the leather crocodiles have a 4 2 pattern of bumps i e one row of four bumps and one row of two bumps 10 x research source alligators have a 2 2 2 pattern of bumps three rows of two and caiman have a 4 4 2 pattern of bumps two rows of four one row of two note a gradual transition of the size and shape of scales the scales of an alligator suddenly transition from wide square shapes to small round shapes meaning one column has large scales while the next has small scales on a crocodile the transition is more gradual as the scales steadily become smaller and more rounded 11 x research source look for pores to distinguish alligator leather from crocodile leather if the back side of the animal was used you should look to see if there are pores holes in the horned scales crocodiles unlike alligators have pores in their scales from

how to buy a carry on bag,when traveling by airplane bringing a carry on bag can be a convenient way to keep a few belongings with you during the flight it can also serve to replace your luggage entirely if you ll only be away from home for a couple days look for bags that adhere to airline restrictions and meet your specific needs as a traveler,look up your airline s size restrictions most airlines restrict total bag size to 45 inches 114 3 cm this breaks down to about 22 inches 55 cm long 14 inches 35 cm wide and 9 inches 22 cm deep if you know what airline you will be flying most

the wheels don t cause the bag to exceed your airline s size restrictions if you re shopping online and it s not clear whether the wheels are factored into the dimensions contact the manufacturer 2 x research source limit the bag weight most major airlines don t have a weight limit for carry on luggage but some smaller ones do this limit will be around 20 to 30 pounds 9 to 13 kg fully packed so if you know you ll be flying an airline with these restrictions look for the lightest bag possible that still meets your storage needs 3 x research source because there s no scale at the gate carry on weight limits are rarely enforced you re more likely to be stopped due to exceeding the size limits select a roll aboard for airport convenience with the amount of time you spend at the airport standing in lines and walking or running through terminals a bag with wheels is almost essential these days because wheels do break occasionally look for brands that offer replacement parts 4 x research source look for a 4 wheeled bag bags with four wheels are often called spinners because they turn 360 degrees while the base is flat on the floor you can push them ahead of you or beside you so you have more carrying options than just dragging it behind you 5 x research source opt for a hard shell for extra protection if you travel with fragile valuables like camera equipment look for bags that have a hard case or shell as the outer material the bag will retain some structure and protect your belongings better than a soft bag 6 x research source select a duffel or tote for flexibility if you re not packing a lot of stuff into your carry on a roll aboard might be excessive soft bags allow you a lot of flexibility they can fit into smaller spaces overhead or be shoved under the seat in front of you find a duffel or tote bag with a good zipper so that none of your belongings spill out as you tuck it into storage 7 x research source choose a backpack for rugged travel if you ll be doing any sort of adventure travel like hiking mountain climbing camping or just walking along unpaved roads or sidewalks invest in a good backpack wheels will only add unnecessary weight to your bag and they likely won t be useful wherever you re going there are convertible bags that can switch between rolling and being worn but you still have the added weight of the wheels which may be too cumbersome for long treks 8 x research source select a bag that has lots of pockets a bag that has many pockets allows you to stow away many smaller items that might get lost inside a bag with no pockets these pockets should be zippered especially if they are on the outside outside pockets are good for items you wish to easily access in the airport or on the plane 9 x research source if you travel with a laptop or tablet look for a flat front pocket that you can easily slide your device in and out of keep in mind that when you place items in outer pockets the size might suddenly exceed the airline limitation to be sure you re still within the limits measure your bag again when it s fully packed find a bag that expands many rolling bags have a zipper along the front that can compress or expand the bag changing the amount of storage space inside this is a good option if you ll sometimes be traveling light and other times be bringing as much as possible but keep in mind that fully expanded the bag still needs to meet your airline s size restrictions 10 x research source look for a wide adjustable shoulder strap if you select a bag without wheels you ll want various options for carrying it the shoulder strap should be adjustable so you can fit it to your own height and it should be wide enough to not cut into your shoulder when it s heavy some straps offer a padded sleeve that fits onto the area right where the strap meets your shoulder 11 x research source the bag should also include a short handle to grasp with your hand look for one on the top

ones you get at hotels remember that for carry on air travel your airline will require all liquids to fit inside a single plastic bag check your airline s carry on rules for size specifications put toiletries that could leak shampoo gel etc in individual plastic bags to avoid mess if you use bar soap which can substitute for other forms of soap such as shampoo and shaving cream get a ventilated holder for it so it doesn t turn to mush through use and storage for quicker trips through airport security try to use solids rather than liquids shampoo is available in solid soap block form and even single use sheets check at a backpacking or outdoor store for more options save extra space by omitting common inexpensive items like body soap and shampoo and purchase them instead when you reach your destination try to leave unnecessary electronics at home minimize the number of items in your bag that require electricity especially those that need to be plugged in continually rather than briefly to recharge as converters can be costly and space consuming mail home or give away items not necessary for traveling such as finished books or souvenirs trading books is a great free way to keep your travel library fresh and can net you some interesting new friends as a result of the exchange,Personal-Care-and-Style

they are buying into for example maybe you d like to start a fashion company that designs socks so you ask yourself what makes your sock designs so unique in a market flooded with other sock designs it could be the socks have a cool design or they are a great price for the quality of the socks or they feature illustrations from another established brand that you are collaborating with consider your target market who are you designing for and why this seems like a basic question but the more specific and clear your answer is the better you can create and market your product to your target market 8 x research source think about if your product is for men or women adults or children a younger market or an older market 9 x research source you can also consider your target market from a

the company with you they are investing in the hopes your business will grow and turn a profit investors can offer you resources and expertise to improve your business but if you disagree with your

to help your business grow money via a bank loan this type of funding doesn t come with any investors to answer to but you will need to pay back the money you have borrowed plus interest so the cash flow of your business will need to account for monthly payments on your loan and interest if you miss any payments you may end up getting angry calls from the bank taking on too much debt can drive your business to bankruptcy so its important to account for your debts and pay them off before the profits are used elsewhere in your company look for other sources of funding family and friends who

promote your product and crowd source your funding source your materials create relationships with fabric companies and supply companies look for materials that fit your needs but won t break your budget depending on how many products or items you are planning to produce you may need fabric in bulk or you may need to take your prototype to a manufacturer find a manufacturer or producer new

be afraid to send samples out of your product to peak the interest of distributors but be smart about going after distributors that you think will fit with the style and brand of your fashion line or product 15 x research source if you plan to sell your work online on sites like etsy keep in mind it may be difficult to stand out among the thousands of products available on that site but it s a good way to ease into the online selling world 16 x research source once your fashion company becomes more established consider creating your own website for your company doing this will allow you to maximize your profits and give you direct access to your customers use social media to your advantage think about how your clothing line or product fits with social media if you re promoting your high end sock line for women for example you may not use facebook to promote your brand instead you may use instagram or pinterest these social media sites can show off the beauty and design of your socks these sites also target a certain market that you may be trying to reach 17 x research source instagram is a great platform for small brands to show off their products it s visual and allows you to continually promote your brand but it s a hard place to drive sales right now as it currently does not allow live links in image captions choose your social media platforms carefully update the

changes if you modify your brand do it slowly over time so you don t freak out your customers ultimately listen to your design instincts as well as customer feedback while you should never ignore your customers needs or wants its important to always be true to your design aesthetic and personal approach to fashion,Personal-Care-and-Style

to make your business successful you ll need to do plenty of research and then design high quality merchandise that people will actually be interested in buying,identify your target market since the t shirt market is already so developed now your own business won t survive long if you try to compete with every other t shirt business instead focus on one target market or niche make your target market specific without becoming too obscure for example funny graphic shirts would be a bad market since it s too broad a better choice would be something like funny graphic shirts about cooking and baking since that addresses a focused yet widespread target group study the competition learn about other t shirt sellers who share similar a similar niche you ll need to be able to compete with them on all levels so that customers will be willing to choose your product over theirs pay attention to your competitors product quality design variety pricing and customer service also note how they promote their products studying the competition isn t as hard as you might initially believe it to be follow the brands on their blogs and social media pages and sign up for their free digital

screen printing is cost effective for large batches but it can be expensive if you want to offer multiple colors it also works best with simple designs and the quality can start decreasing once designs become too complex heat transfers make it easier to print shirts on demand the designs need to be professionally printed on high quality heat transfer paper but you ll need to invest in a heat press machine and transfer the design to each shirt yourself the overall quality is less durable than screen printing and direct to garment printing too direct to garment printing creates high quality images and makes it easier to produce small orders in a wide range of colors the designs themselves can also be very detailed without a drop in quality it won t be very cost effective for large

possible don t use this account or card for anything other than your business know what to expect before money starts changing hands get quotes from multiple printers and compare cost to value factor in the cost of labeling packaging storage and shipping supplies too ultimately the cost of production will be the key factor in determining the sale price of your product establish your own brand even if you only have two or three designs you should still market them as part of a larger brand instead of selling them separately and anonymously keep the content and quality of your t shirts consistent across the brand creating a brand will make it easier to advertise customers who purchase from you will associate the t shirt with your brand and might be more likely to return to your brand later or recommend it to others additionally creating a brand before you start selling will make it easier to expand your business if you decide to add more designs later create unique designs the graphics and slogans used on your shirts don t need to be complex but they must be original enough to stand out in a flooded market you can design everything yourself if that s your area of expertise but if it isn t work with a designer to create something that works check out online design communities like dribbble and behance or freelance networks like freelancer and elance search through the work of existing freelance designers in these networks and contact the designers you like about working with you check your design before finalizing your design check the way it looks on digital mockup images since customers will want to see the design before buying you ll need to make these same images available to customers once you start selling you could use photo imaging software and digital t shirt templates to create your own design previews you can even use design tools offered by online companies to create your t shirt design alternatively you can skip the digital mockup and simply print one sample shirt with that design if you choose to sell that particular design take a digital photograph to show your customers how it looks use high quality materials take time to choose the right type of blank t shirts for your business aside from the cost you also need to choose blank shirts made with comfortable material the fit and sizing of those shirts should be agreeable as well do your own

look for local print shops that can work with you you ll also need to invest in a high quality heat press machine if you use screen printing or direct to garment printing find online printers with good reputations note that screen printers will often print batches and ship them to you but direct to garment printers will usually print individual shirts and ship them directly to the consumer test the quality of the final product order or print up a sample version of your product to check the quality of your merchandise you ll need to sell high quality products if you want your business to survive past the first few months if you re dissatisfied with the way the product looks figure out what the problem is and correct it the design might not look as good in print as it did digitally and the problem may lie with the design itself the printing method you chose for it or the company doing the printing get feedback before opening shop run the design and final product past potential customers before rolling it out and trying to sell it make sure that there s interest in a design before you invest the time and money required to sell it post images of the design on social network pages understand that friends and relatives might be biased toward you however so some of the feedback might be idealistically positive instead of realistically so consider running a crowd funding campaign if people like your design well enough to pledge money to it the design itself has good odds of success pick an online market platform you can either create your own website or rely on a third party website to host the online storefront of your business there are pros and cons to either option 5 x research source creating your own website allows you to have more control over how merchandise is displayed and sold it can cost more money however and it might be more difficult to inform potential customers about your brand third party websites can be less expensive at the time of start up but you ll usually have to split the cost of each sale so you ll need to sell your shirts at a higher cost or settle for a smaller profit this can still be a great option though if you aren t confident about your ability to maintain your own website or market your product independently consider non digital sales many if not most contemporary t shirt businesses strictly sell their product online especially if they use direct to garment printing if you print using heat transfers or screen printing however you might want to consider selling some of your products at craft shows and related events if you someday hope to sell your shirts in stores be honest about that goal and make a conscious effort to strive for it it might be difficult to achieve at the start of your business but if you can become successful online and at small in person venues you can maximize your odds of someday selling your wares at an actual storefront advertise online since most of your sales will probably be online most of your advertising will likely be online too many forms of online advertising are even free which is great if you don t have a large marketing budget establish business accounts on social networks like facebook pinterest twitter and instagram you can also connect to your customers directly through e mail lists and blogs network with t shirt blogs and other blogs connected to your target market as you establish good connections to these other bloggers you can ask them to help your business by making a note of it on their blogs free forms of advertising can be a good start but you ll eventually need to put money into marketing if you want your business to continue expanding do your research on paid online advertisements to determine which might be the best setup for your brand market your brand in person even if your business is primarily or entirely online you should still do a little marketing in person traditional advertisements might not be very cost effective for this type of business so focus most of your efforts on promotional advertising essentially promotional advertising heavily relies on your willingness to give out freebies if you can factor it into your budget give out a handful of free t shirts at an event or donate old stock to secondhand store consider sponsoring a local little league or bowling team and provide the shirts free of cost you can also give out stickers postcards and other small promotional stickers 6 x research source be persistent don t expect immediate success running any business will require a considerable amount of hard work and you ll need to keep working at it to achieve success if your t shirts aren t selling identify the problem and try to fix it it could be an issue with the design the price or the overall quality continue to analyze your strategies and plans throughout the life of your business even when it s experiencing success never settle for good enough you should make your business the best it can be enjoy your work it ll be much easier to remain passionate about your business if you enjoy the work so do what you can to blend your passions into your overall business model it s perfectly normal to feel burned out at times but you can t let those periods slow you down read motivational books or find out what others are doing to make their businesses both successful and

market value of the perfume if the perfume is still sold in stores your listing will need to be well below retail value perfumes that are rare or discontinued may sell for a higher price point than

level can be seen in the picture you should clearly specify how much is left if you do not know the exact amount estimate it erring on the side of caution by guessing too low rather than too high buyers probably won t complain if they get more perfume than indicated but they will if they feel you cheated by selling them an amount less than what you indicated mention the manufacturer you need to state both the fragrance name and the manufacturer s name sometimes two separate fragrances can have the same name even though they were produced by different manufacturers mentioning both can

someone slips and falls in your store and sues you for negligence product liability insurance is the big one for a cosmetics line this insurance protects you and your business in the event one of your customers is harmed by your products in the context of cosmetics this includes for example someone having an allergic reaction to one of your ingredients something like that can happen even if you re using all natural ingredients you may need premises liability insurance if you have employees helping you make your cosmetics professional liability insurance also may help you if you run a blog in conjunction with your cosmetic line through which you dispense beauty or makeup advice if you think you need several types of insurance you might consider buying a business owner s policy these policies bundle several types of insurance commonly needed by small business owners together which can lower your premium speak to an insurance agent if you re having trouble figuring out exactly what risks you need to protect your business against an insurance agent can help you analyze your business and identify the types of insurance you need 7 x trustworthy source u s small business administration u s government agency focused on supporting small businesses go to source you aren t obligated to buy any policies at this stage you re trying to figure out what you need be skeptical of agents who seem to be more motivated to sell you something than to answer your questions you might want to find an agent through your local small business association or through a trade association you also can look for further information and advice on the internet the website of the federal government s small business association sba has lots of resources on business insurance review licensing requirements in your state if you want to manufacture and sell your own cosmetic line you typically must get a business license in the state where your business will be based some states require certain minimum levels of insurance as a condition of maintaining a license in good standing 8 x trustworthy source u s small business administration u s government agency focused on supporting small businesses go to source 9 x trustworthy source u s small business administration u s government agency focused on supporting small businesses go to source the sba has a list of all state licensing requirements on its website just search for state licenses and permits to find the page on the licensing page click on the name of the state where you live to find what you need keep in mind that if you don t meet your state s licensing requirements the regulatory agency can shut down your business and you may end up paying substantial fines or penalties the requirements of distributors or retail establishments where you plan to sell your cosmetics are just as important as your state s licensing requirements many distributors require product manufacturers to provide proof of a certain amount of product liability insurance coverage calculate the amount and types of coverage you need experts in the cosmetics industry typically recommend that you have between 1 million and 2 million in product liability insurance you also may want additional commercial liability or premises liability insurance 10 x research source 11 x research source if you plan to make your cosmetics in your own home check your homeowner s or renter s insurance many owners of home based businesses believe this insurance also covers their business but often business activities are explicitly exempted from coverage if you re considering a business owner s policy you still need to make sure you re covered for the appropriate levels under each type of insurance bundled in the policy for example it does you no good to have 5 million of general liability insurance if you only have 1 million in product liability coverage and the distributor you want to carry your cosmetic line requires you to have 2 million in product liability coverage build in room for growth you ll be purchasing coverage for at least a year and you can t predict what will happen to your business during that time for this reason it s typically better for you to have too much coverage than to wind up having too little 12 x research source particularly with product liability insurance you typically are required to pay your entire annual premium upfront this can make it difficult to change your coverage in the middle of the year if you discover you need more to adequately accomplish your business s goals if you know others in the industry you may want to ask them for advice for example someone who has had a home based cosmetic line for five years may be able to provide insight on things they wish they d done when they were just starting out locate several providers you typically can search online for insurance companies that offer commercial liability or product liability insurance focus on companies that provide insurance specifically for cosmetics manufacturers as they will have a better understanding of the needs of your business 13 x research source 14 x research source 15 x research source doing a general internet search for cosmetics product liability insurance will get you some possibilities you also want to ask anyone you know who is currently in the industry if you don t know anyone personally consider talking to someone in an industry or trade organization near you contact other people you see who have home based cosmetic lines and ask them which insurance company they use small business owners frequently are more than willing to help others who express an interest in their fields many people who ve established their own cosmetic lines also have blogs where they discuss various aspects of the industry look beyond cosmetics as well to related industries such as homemade soaps or haircare products these industries have many of the same insurance needs as cosmetics complete insurance applications typically you must complete a basic application to get a quote for coverage you will need to provide the insurance company with a little information about your business and the cosmetics you make 16 x research source 17 x trustworthy source u s small business administration u s government agency focused on supporting small businesses go to source insurance companies will vary in the amount of information they want about your business and your products before they can issue a quote if you re looking for product liability insurance in particular keep in mind that any quote you receive is only as accurate as the amount of information you give different ingredients have different risks associated with them however you typically are under no obligation to disclose every ingredient in your cosmetics some insurance companies won t cover certain ingredients at all due to the tremendous risk involved this is a particular concern in the herbal supplements industry but may impact you if you re including similar herbal ingredients in your cosmetics such as kava or magnolia discuss your quote with an agent if you have any questions about the quotes or what is covered you should be able to talk to an agent with the company they can explain more about the quote and may be able to adjust it based on the information you provide 18 x research source 19 x trustworthy source u s small business administration u s government agency focused on supporting small businesses go to source the most important thing you need to know about each quote is whether the insurance quoted will provide the coverage you need for your cosmetics line read any information that comes with the quote carefully including disclaimers or disclosures keep in mind that your premium may increase after you complete the full application for insurance coverage based on a number of factors including your business background and credit history look for discounts industry associations and trade organizations may have arrangements or affiliations with particular insurance companies going through one of these organizations may save you a lot of money compared to getting a policy on your own 20 x research source 21 x research source on the other hand going through a business network or trade organization may limit your choices there may only be specific policies available through a single insurance company if you re not going to get the amount of coverage you need through a network plan the money you d save is irrelevant if you already have insurance policies through an insurance company it can t hurt to see if they offer the insurance you need for your cosmetic line many insurance companies provide discounts to customers who have more than one policy with them compare rates and levels of coverage once you ve gotten quotes from several insurance companies take some time to compare what they re offering you also want to look at other aspects of the company such as location and customer service 22 x research source 23 x trustworthy source u s small business administration u s government agency focused on supporting small businesses go to source generally you want to find the most coverage at the least cost to you when assessing the cost take into account your deductible in addition to the premium you must pay typically you ll pay a higher premium for the same amount of coverage with a lower deductible make sure the deductible is an amount you can afford to pay if something happens an extremely low premium payment won t be of much benefit to you if you have to pay thousands of dollars you can t afford on a claim meet with an agent or broker before you start your coverage you should arrange to meet with an agent or broker who works for the insurance company that will be writing your policy this agent or broker will be able to explain the policy to you and answer any questions you might have 24 x trustworthy source u s small business administration u s government agency focused on supporting small businesses go to source many insurance companies give you the opportunity to get a quote and purchase your policy online rather than coming into an office in person this can be a benefit to you because it gives you access to many different insurance carriers however it may make it more difficult to talk to someone if you have questions or get personal attention to your policy if you re buying a policy online look for a customer service phone number or email so you can contact them with any questions get any explanations or promises from the agent or broker in writing so you have proof of them if a problem comes up later go over the policy you ve chosen have the agent or broker explain all the terms and conditions of your policy including the amounts of coverage and the types of incidents or risks that are covered by your policy 25 x research source 26 x trustworthy source u s small business

down the legalese of an insurance policy into language anyone can understand if you don t understand your insurance policy the coverage it offers or what you should do if you need to file a claim don t sign it sign your policy acceptance typically you must sign a number of documents to purchase your policy in most cases your policy is effective the date you sign these forms although you may be allowed to choose a specific effective date 27 x research source 28 x trustworthy source u s small business administration u s government agency focused on supporting small businesses go to source make sure you have complete copies of your policy and all forms you ve signed for your records keep your copies in a safe place preferably in the same place where you keep your business licenses permits and other legal documents related to your cosmetic line pay your premium while a few insurance companies allow small business owners to pay commercial or product liability premiums in installments typically you must pay the entire annual premium up front 29 x research source 30 x research source your agent or broker should let you know if an installment plan is available for your premium keep in mind that if you pay in installments you may end up paying more total than you would if you paid your entire annual premium up front the other thing to keep in mind with installments is that missing a single payment could result in cancellation of your policy leaving you vulnerable on the other hand paying your entire annual premium up front means you don t have to worry about it

how to price your jewelry designs,pricing jewelry is one of the most important parts of jewelry making because it will both speak to the quality of your product and determine whether your business can be profitable there are many formulas for setting the price of your jewelry but most of them should give you similar prices after you have a good estimate you can adapt the price according to the market,keep a recipe book to record what you spent on each design price every item used in your designs for example if you pay 1 50 for a dozen sterling crimp beads and you used 2 crimps beads in your design you would divide 1 50 by 12 the more meticulous you are about calculating expenses the better your pricing will be keep track of packing materials and the shipping costs keep receipts this will make it easier to keep track of costs you can use them when calculating tax deductions if you do not keep meticulous track of costs you should round up when estimating costs you don t want to short yourself you should be purchasing supplies at wholesale prices i e bulk prices if you purchase them at retail price these calculations will be off and it is probable that you will have trouble turning a profit 1 x research source record the time you spent on each design the time you spent on each design is important in calculating your labor costs it is also important for establishing your profitability if it takes you 30 minutes to recreate a design you would charge differently than you would for a design that takes 4 5 hours to create write your time spent in your recipe book calculate labor costs to determine your labor costs divide the time you spent working into 15 minute segments it makes it easier to calculate price if you spend a little over an hour making a certain piece round it up to an hour and 15 minutes you can charge more for custom made pieces keep in mind this is only the cost of your time this is not your actual salary you charge whatever you believe your time is worth do not however charge ridiculously high labor costs if you re just starting out if you already have a reputation as jewelry maker or other you can charge higher prices if for example you have priced your labor at 20 per hour and worked for 30 minutes on the design you would multiple 20 x 5 10 or divide in half when deciding how much to pay yourself hourly consider your experience how long have you been designing jewelry if you have a long track record vast expertise and a portfolio of unique designs you may find that you can charge more you may also have particular advantages including contacts and unique designs that allow you to charge more 2 x research source calculate wholesale prices wholesale prices are lower prices that you offer to retailers who purchase approximately 10 items at a time 3 x research source formula s vary but a good model is to add your material and packing costs and multiply those by 10 to account for overhead and add that to material costs then add your labor costs rate x time multiply this by your profit margin which varies but should be around 20 4 x research source for example if the item cost you 10 in supplies and 1 in packaging multiply 11 x 10 1 1 11 12 1 add to your material costs 12 1 the price of labor if you spent one hour and thirty minutes at a rate of 25 per hour that would be 25 x 1 5 37 5 add labor plus materials 12 1 37 5 39 6 multiply by your profit margin 39 6 x 2 7 92 39 6 47 52 round up to 48 whole prices are lower to account for all of the money you save selling items in bulk selling in bulk means that you need to spend less time interacting with customers and less money shipping items or setting up stands when you want to start selling at wholesale prices is up to you but usually a purchase of anywhere from 6 to 12 items will justify whole sale prices 5 x research source overhead costs are how you factor in long term costs for your operation this might include the price of a digital camera to take pictures the cost of maintaining a website or the price of space to make your jewelry the best way to account for this to multiple your material costs by 10 6 x research source calculate retail price the retail price is the larger price you charge for an average customer buying one or two items at a time because this sort of exchange is more labor and price intensive on your part you want to charge anywhere from 1 4 2 times your wholesale price thus if your whole sale price was 48 you want to charge anywhere from 67 48 x 1 4 to 96 48 x 2 don t sell yourself short you should be slow to decrease your prices people often take low prices as a sign of shoddy workmanship furthermore underselling your competitors makes it difficult for anyone to make a living in the business be willing to wait for your items to begin selling and never sell below the price of supplies perform market research check your price calculations against comparable items review online jewelry sites or brick and mortar stores to see what things are selling for if you can talk to an experienced designer ask them for price estimates most importantly ask yourself if you are selling enough items or conversely if you are selling them quickly enough to justify a price increase have people offered to buy any of your jewelry designs this is a good indication of the marketability of your designs reevaluate your design if your items are not selling it is typically better to change your design than lower your prices this can mean reducing material or labor costs i could also mean starting over with a completely new design that more people are interested in purchasing assess your materials if you aren t purchasing in bulk and getting wholesale prices the materials will be too expensive for you to turn a profit it can be hard to sell labor intensive items that require a lot of time because consumers do not necessarily understand how much time is required to make them and are not willing to pay commensurate prices sometimes adapting these labor intensive products into smaller designs is a good way to reduce the amount of time you put into them and begin selling them at rates the market will bear increase your prices if your items are selling well and you have committed customers you can increase your price consider developing two price ranges continuing making the products that have been successful but also begin making higher quality products that you can charge more for with this two tier pricing system you can continue to attract new customers with cheap products while pulling in larger margins in the upscale market,Personal-Care-and-Style
how to sell antique jewelry,you can usually find a buyer for your antique jewelry by checking different places that buy jewelry however knowing how to get the best price for your antique jewelry is another matter altogether getting the best price starts by educating yourself about vintage jewelry and learning how much the jewelry is worth the next most important factor is knowing exactly where to sell it to get the most for your jewelry,look at the aesthetics objectively ask yourself if someone unrelated to you would genuinely be interested in wearing the piece of jewelry look through fashion magazines many of them have upscale antique and current antique style jewelry this will give you an idea if the jewelry you have is currently in style if it is selling it will be much easier be aware that when jewelry holds sentimental value for you it can often affect how much you want to sell it for and it s much harder to take into consideration how others would impartially value it while the antique style is currently in it is only in to a certain degree if your pieces are not in vogue you may be better off selling them for their metal or gemstones consider the condition simply put jewelry that is less worn will sell better than jewelry that has been worn frequently or is damaged pieces that have issues can be restored which may improve the likelihood of selling them but the restoration costs for major repairs can actually be higher than the money you will make from selling the piece once the repairs are complete 1 x research source plus serious collectors often do not like pieces that have been restored so restoration often reduces the value of the piece if you are only replacing missing gemstones by all means repair it provided they are easy to replace and the stones from that period are readily available the good part is that it s unusual to be able to tell if a stone has been replaced if it was restored correctly if you know the piece is valuable based on research and family history it may make sense to have the jewelry appraised appraisals especially written ones are never free especially from an organization such as the gia the gemological institute of america formed in 1931 or even a local jewelry store and can run in the hundreds of dollars for items worth thousands so keep that in mind and an appraisal for insurance purposes is always higher than what your jewelry is worth on a retail basis expect it to be less than half it s replacement value when you re trying to sell it you are closer to a tenth of the insurance value and remember even when a piece is valuable people seldom want to pay what it s worth older appraisals can tell someone what stones are in the setting the gold platinum or silver content and design as well as age but not current value it s always a good idea to keep all of your appraisals to show how the value has increased and a good rule of thumb is to count on it s doubling in value approximately every 7 years or so based on how the fine metal markets are doing give the jewelry a good cleaning unless otherwise instructed by an antique collector or an appraiser you should clean the jewelry to make it look as appealing as possible if you do not know how to clean a piece properly though you could end up damaging it taking the jewelry to a jeweler or other professional is your best option unless you are absolutely certain that you can clean the piece without harming it however be very cautious with using a jeweler to clean stones if the stone has any inclusions cleaning with a sonic machine or steam could destroy the stone literally breaking it into pieces especially diamonds the safest way to clean most jewelry is to gently scrub it with mild soap and warm water using a soft toothbrush toothpaste can work on hard gemstones but it can scratch gold and softer gemstones such as opals even a toothbrush can cause marks on very soft high gold content jewelry and soft stones 2 x research source never use chlorine to clean gold or gemstones ammonia is safe to use on hard gemstones but is too abrasive for many gemstones if you are not sure what the stones are since many look alike such as aquamarines and topaz you are better off using a soft cloth and dish soap with warm not hot or cold water rinse very well the very safest way to clean antique jewelry is by using a microfiber cloth without any liquids at all 3 x research source gauge the worth of gold by looking at the karat stamp but be aware that many places can buy stamps and put incorrect stamps on jewelry the karat stamp reveals how pure the gold is a 24 karat gold piece is pure gold and will be worth approximately the current running price of gold per ounce at the selling cost not buying which is always higher most jewelry especially antique pieces are only 9 karat pieces meaning that they are only about 37 5 percent pure as such you will only receive at most one third the price of scrap gold other pieces can be as high as 23 karat gold and those pieces will be malleable to the touch and you can actually make marks in the jewelry itself finding 23k gold is unusual in the usa and europe and much more common in asia and india it has a reddish look compared to the yellow gold the usa and europe is more used to seeing 4 x research source some very old gold does not have a karat stamp so you may want to test it to make sure that it is actually gold often when a piece is sized or worn often the karat stamp may have been cut off or worn off making it impossible to tell the purity of the gold also given the propensity for some makers to incorrectly mark gold you almost always want to chemical test to check the purity another quick way to test the jewelry is to expose it to a magnet if it sticks then it is not real gold this test does not work on all metals including platinum which may or may not have a recognizable stamp brush up on gem value knowing how valuable certain gemstones are can give you a good idea of how valuable your jewelry is of course without official certification you have no way of knowing just how valuable or high quality a specific gem is or even if it is real that is where a jeweler comes in they can tell you what stones are in your jewelry and if they are real even if you don t get an actual appraisal you will have an idea of the jewelry s value based on the stones the types of stones used in your jewelry can also often help you date pieces so that you have more information for the buyers sell the jewelry to a jewelry shop almost any jewelry shop that buys jewelry will be willing to purchase yours provided it s in fairly decent condition the jeweler will usually pay you up to 40 percent of the gold s current scrap price for gold jewelry and if the piece itself is signed by a maker such as tiffany s or another designer they may pay you more for the jewelry itself instead of only paying you for the metal and the gems it is best to talk to several jewelers before making a final sale however to ensure that you get the best offer be aware that most jewelry stores buy jewelry based on scrap prices not the selling price of gold so you will likely get approximately 1 10th to 1 7th the selling value of the item unless it has a tremendous provenance or value do not expect a very high return when selling vintage jewelry list the jewelry online create a listing for your jewelry on an auction website free online classifieds website or on a website that specializes in the sale of vintage or antique goods be sure to include plenty of pictures and to mention any certification that the jewelry has also make sure to sell a piece for a cost that is comparable with other similar pieces being sold on the same website set up shop on your own if you have a lot of jewelry to sell you can create your own webpage fairly easily and it might be a better option for you if you have a large supply of antique jewelry that you plan on selling on a long term basis sell your jewelry for parts if you are unable to find a buyer interested in your jewelry as a wearable piece you may need to sell it as scrap mail away gold buying operations allow you to send your gold in and will send a check back to you in return but while this is convenient it pays the least of any of your options so only do a gold party or mail order envelope as a last resort meanwhile many coin shops are willing to purchase gold jewelry if it is pure enough though and will usually pay a higher price if your jewelry is in bad shape but the gems are in good condition a jeweler may be interested in acquiring the piece so that the gems can be removed and reused in another piece but this does not often happen take the jewelry into a pawn shop pawn shops will test the jewelry to make sure that its metals and gemstones are real and if everything is valuable they are usually willing to buy the piece at fraction of it s value it s how they make money by buying pieces of jewelry for as little as possible it is a quick way to make a little money and as an added benefit if you change your mind a day or two later you can return to the pawn shop and buy it back with interest 5 x

you to draw the right client base to your online shop 1 x research source prepare yourself for the fees involved in order to make money you have to spend money first marketplace websites make most of their money by charging fees many online market places charge listing fees which are fees you pay to post an item to the website and renewal fees or fees paid to renew a listing if it expires before being sold some websites also take a percentage of the money you make from each item you sell every marketplace website is different though so you must research the fees for each one before signing up find out what methods of payment you must use the majority of marketplace websites will accept the most common methods of payment but this is not a guarantee if you have a preferred method of payment you should first find out which marketplace websites allow that method to be used gauge how easy it will be to contact customer support a marketplace website that provides a phone number as well as an email address is more likely to be able to help you if any problems arise better customer support will lead to a more pleasant selling experience consider starting your own website once your business grows 2 x research source when you start to develop your own customer base you can switch over to your own website and most of your customers will follow you there there are still fees involved with having your own website but if you can generate a lot of sales the fees will be much smaller than they would be if you continued selling through an online marketplace allow your customers to pay you through a certified third party payment service new customers are more likely to feel safer using a third party payment group than they would be giving you their credit card information directly go the extra mile to make your website look professional use webpage software or hire a web designer note that you should only switch to your own website once you are able to invest a good deal of time into building your business otherwise the cost of maintaining a website may not be worth it for the amount of sales you generate know what people want 3 x research source if you sell generic pieces of jewelry that can be found just about anywhere you are less likely to attract attention as a new seller instead cater to a specific interest or niche browse through message boards and blogs to get an idea of what people want you can also visit online stores and marketplaces that rank search results by popularity take good pictures the downfall of selling jewelry online is that buyers cannot examine the piece in person as a result clear informative photographs are essential take pictures using a high resolution digital camera photograph each piece of jewelry from different angles getting as close as possible without blurring the image and using natural light or other clear lighting you may even want to prop the jewelry up next to coins or other items that show the size of each piece 4 x research source as your business grows you can consider hiring a photography student or professional photographer to take better pictures for you price your items for what they are worth pricing an item too high will discourage customers for obvious reasons but pricing an item too low will decrease the perceived value of a piece there are several common pricing models used by jewelry designers 5 x research source first you must determine the wholesale value then determine the retail pricing that you will sell at the simplest wholesale value scale is to take the total material cost and multiply it by 3 or 3 5 you can also factor labor into the wholesale cost more directly by multiplying the number of hours you worked by an hourly wage like 35 per hour and taking the product of that equation and adding the total cost of the material to it determine the retail price by multiplying the wholesale price by any number between 1 4 and 2 0 depending on how high quality you feel your jewelry is use accurate keywords accurate keywords will draw interested customers to your shop while making sure uninterested customers are not misled there you should also take into consideration the types of keywords you choose when people shop via online search engines they generally type in the most basic information possible for instance someone looking for a heart shaped pendant is likely to search for heart necklace or heart pendant when choosing titles and keywords avoid using overly specific terms that are unlikely to show up on a search engine hit 6 x research source at the same time you should avoid being too vague a necklace titled silver aquamarine heart necklace will pick up more hits than one titled heart necklace since anyone interested in silver aquamarine heart or necklace will have a chance at making it to your online shop make use of social media advertise you products on as many social media websites as possible actively seek out friends and followers and continually post links to new listings in your online store 7 x research source advertise where potential buyers might be instead of advertising in forums that are geared toward jewelry makers advertise in forums that are a little more neutral create a blog and connect to other bloggers with an interest in fashion and design join message board communities and leave a link to your online store in your signature as long as the rules of the board allow it 8 x research source look into pay per click advertisements you only pay for these advertisements when someone clicks on the ad and is redirected to your store essentially you are advertising your online shop and only paying for the people who notice your ad advertise in the real world your homemade jewelry business may stay online but that does not mean your marketing campaign should while the majority of your advertising should be done online you can also print flyers or business cards to spread out around your local area include information about how to visit your online jewelry listings as well as information and pictures of some of the jewelry you sell,Personal-Care-and-Style

point trying to get a good price on a watch you only paid 50 00 for watches made to last a short time from cheap plastic with gimmicks on them or using fake designer labels are not worth your effort in trying to sell them at least not for a decent return on the other hand an expensive swiss watch made of metal with fine workings from a reputable designer brand and targeted at the luxury market may well be worth your time selling 1 x research source the watch should be currently desirable one of the sought after brands for some people this means only swiss but for others it generally means high end brands or specific editions 2 x research source a list of watches that appear to hold their resale value is found at the end of this article this is not to say you can t sell a cheap watch it simply means you need to expect next to nothing for it and sell it through a method that won t chew up the sale in commission and opportunity cost understand which features tend to attach to watches with good resale value there are some features that those in the watch resale industry consider help ensure that the watch keeps sufficient value for resale these include 3 x research source the watch is made from stainless steel complexity of the watch it will be worth more if it took many months to create by hand conservative it has hours minutes seconds and date no other features too faddish too garish and the watch is less likely to hold its value well it is of an average size although this depends on the trends of the time and brand influence it uses automatic swiss movement the brand is recognizable and sells well when new the watch is rarer than other watches if it was sold in limited supply or as a limited edition perhaps for an anniversary celebration of the watchmaker it will often be more attractive as a resale item but see conservative above consider the condition of the watch even if your watch is desirable is it in good shape some things to consider include the watch should be in very good condition close to as good as new if possible get a professional clean from an expert if it needs a clean and polish up do not attempt this yourself in case you devalue the watch the watch should be in working condition if not can you get it fixed and still make it a worthwhile sale be aware that replacement pieces can immediately devalue its worth 4 x research source the watch should be original as noted replacement pieces can alter the value as can aftermarket add ons 5 x research source does the watch come with its original packaging and perhaps even with the sales receipt these peripheral items can increase the value because they help to authenticate both the source and the original purchase price plus some people like to have the original packaging if it was well made find out how much your quality watch is worth be aware that the after market price will be very different from the profit inclusive retail price in most cases your watch will be worth quite a lot less than what you paid for it however in some cases it may have increased in value due to its rarity collectible status or in some cases because it was owned by someone famous notorious or noteworthy do an online search to determine the current value of the watch you can find out through various sources whether or not the watch has value begin with the brand s own website and retailer sites to see whether the watch in question is still being sold and for what price most useful of all especially for older vintage watches are the auction sites if you find watches of the same brand style and date selling on these sites you will get a good idea of current market value what buyers are likely to pay for it 6 x research source be sure to do a comparison with quite a few different sellers and auctions sites just in case nobody is buying and the sellers are just valuing off each other additional research can be done by checking out books about watches from the library or online ebook sources look for information about what makes your watch unique and desirable or what it lacks by way of those essentials find out what the aftermarket prices for watches identical to or as much like yours as possible if you start veering too far away from the age style and condition of your watch your appraisal won t be realistic it must be like with like unless you know something about the watch that sets it apart such as a famous actor or singer having once owned it in which case you ll need proof 7 x research source be aware that even within the same range of watches some may have been made better than others in order to capture two different price markets always be sure of which one you have before assuming it is worth a good amount move beyond your own research and analysis of the watch s value get a professional appraisal and be sure to obtain a certificate from the appraiser knowing the exact value of your watch is the best way to get as much money as possible for it if you consider it s worth the effort to sell your watch move to the selling stage discussed next find a buyer the best way to sell a watch will depend on its value and whether you re happy to sell it direct or you d rather sell through someone selling direct requires more effort on your behalf but you will likely get more for the sale as selling through someone else usually entails a high commission sell direct there are various ways that you can do this including consider whether anyone you know has expressed an interest in your watch before this might be a friend a family member or a coworker of course you ll need to be polite and make it clear that there is absolutely no pressure don t let anyone feel they have to buy your watch try offering the watch to this person at a fair price before trying one of the other ways of selling it sell via an auction site auction sites such as ebay will allow buyers from all around the world to find your watch if it s something that a person is after no matter where they are they can bid on it however you will need to have a good track record of sales as the trust factor is very important when selling a collectible or valuable item if you haven t established this yet this option may not be the best one for you to reassure bidders have the official valuation done and included as part of the sale 8 x research source if online auctions aren t for you try a watch swap and sell online forum many watch enthusiast websites have forums where people within the community trade and sell watches while finding joining and building an element of trust within these communities takes time it can be rewarding to be involved in a community where people have interests that are similar to your own on the other hand there is a certain amount of risk associated with working within systems like these so use extreme caution if you choose to try your luck with a forum sell through someone else if you aren t keen to do the groundwork yourself there are other options open to you for selling your watch through a qualified seller a safe and often easy way to sell your watch is to take it to a professional jeweler or watch shop perhaps the same one that appraised your watch and ask whether they would be willing to buy your watch from you or place it on consignment on your behalf you can sometimes ask for store credit something that will probably appeal to the owner the pitfall here is that most jewelry stores and watch specialists have high overhead and need to maximize profits so though you re likely to get less in the end than you would with other methods as an alternative to auction sites where you list items and market them on your own consider an auction site that specializes in high value items marketing them only to qualified buyers sell through an auction house call local auction houses and set up a meeting for assessing the worth of auctioning off your watch if there are specific jewelry and watch auctions run by the auction house you ll be able to get your watch both appraised and allotted to a specific auction that will attract people expecting watches however this option is only recommended if your watch is worth a great deal such as 100 000 or if the auction house is small and doesn t take huge commissions 9 x research source for any less you may find fees and commissions are just too prohibitive there is also the risk of using a small auction house not being able to get you the return on the watch that you re seeking pawnshops are always looking for watches to buy but in most cases they should be considered as a last resort most pawnshop staffers have no special knowledge of watches and unfortunately low balling prices as a means of staying on the safe side and maximizing profits is universal throughout the pawnshop business if you d like to get a short term loan and use your watch as collateral you may find the idea of working with a pawnshop appealing otherwise it s best to avoid pawnshops if at all possible sell low value watches cheaply if you have an old watch or various old watches that are still in good condition but aren t valuable keep the price low around 2 to 10 for really ordinary watches and up to 100 or so for fashionable low end designer watches look for a watch category on an online site or check out the costume jewelry categories to see whether these include watch sales too if getting something is better than nothing then you will probably find a buyer who is happy with the bargain and you can always keep adjusting the price downward until someone nibbles bear in mind costs of the site s commission packaging and your time before settling on the final price to list cheap watches at another alternative way is to sell if at a yard or garage sale a car boot sale or on a market stall however you ll also need to be selling a whole lot of other stuff to make this effort worthwhile some people like to do craft with old watches if you have a bundle of watch faces and workings that you no longer want consider listing these in a craft section of an auction site or some type of craft supplies exchange get paid once your watch has sold get paid in the safest and most appropriate way relevant to the method of selling you ve used in a nutshell with online auction sites such as ebay you may have to wait for your money if you don t have a well established seller profile the more money you make on the transaction the longer you may have to wait for your cash 10 x research source citation needed you can accept payments by cash on collection through bank account or by credit if the watch is really valuable you may also wish to use an escrow service offered by the auction site in which a third party handles the transaction to ensure it is authentic and above board when working with most online retail sites payment happens immediately usually with funds being sent directly to your bank account if you decide to sell your watch via forum payment varies as such it s vital that you work with a trusted buyer and do not send the watch until payment is confirmed when working with jewelry stores and watch sellers you may be paid immediately for a sale although in some cases you may be forced to wait until your watch actually sells to a local buyer there may be other reasons for payment delays too discuss this with the retailer before going ahead with the sale with pawnshops you get cash in hand immediately but you are likely to be less than pleased with the way the overall transaction went 11 x research source

jeweler to sell your ring on consignment for a cut of the final sale just be sure to get your ring appraised before you sell it and to do your research to make sure you are working with a trustworthy

offer between thirty and seventy percent of the retail value depending upon the diamond quality 2 x research source selling directly to a customer shopping for a ring might enable you to get more than a jeweler or diamond dealer would offer but you are still unlikely to get the full value of the ring set a reasonable expectation at around sixty percent of the ring s retail value and have that offer ready to present to jewelers get the ring appraised before you set out to sell your diamond ring you should know exactly what you have have the ring appraised by a certified appraiser ideally one who does not directly buy diamonds so that you can get a better picture of the quality and value of your piece 3 x research source appraisal can also help you establish credibility for your ring a ring that you thought was diamond may turn out to be a different stone or the setting may be a different metal than you originally thought an appraiser can let you know for sure and provide you with documentation an appraiser can also help you establish the retail value of your ring which you can use to adjust your resale value remembering that you are unlikely to get full appraisal value when selling 4 x research source if you think your diamond is likely not very valuable spending money on an appraisal may not be necessary if you paid less than 1 000 to 2 000 for the ring a diamond dealer may be able to give you a reasonable value estimation for free research your selling options when you sell your diamonds you have two general options the first is to sell to a reseller such as a jewelry store diamond dealer or pawn shop that will turn around and sell the ring again the second option is to try to sell the ring directly to a customer online or through your personal network 5 x research source selling to a dealer or jeweler is often more immediate as finding a buyer can take time if you are looking to get your money quickly or if you simply want to be rid of the piece selling to a diamond buyer may be your best option 6 x research source if you are not in a rush to get rid of your ring selling directly to a buyer either through an online marketplace or through your network of personal contacts can sometimes allow you to get more money than you may have received working with a diamond buyer 7 x research source you may also be able to sell to an online auction site that takes a commission from the sale but allows you to sell directly to a customer potentially still getting more than you could get from a jeweler offer authentication your diamond ring is going to be easier to sell when you can provide verification that the piece you re selling is a genuine diamond of the quality you are stating include the diamond certificate with the ring if you have it to establish the quality of your ring save a copy of the certificate for your records but offer the original with the sale if you do not have the diamond certificate but are dealing with a potentially valuable stone you may consider getting a grading report from an independent laboratory such as the gemological institute of america 8 x trustworthy source gemological institute of america nonprofit institute responsible for gemological research and education and setting gemstone buying and selling standards go to source include quality images regardless of what you are selling postings both online and in print get better responses when the lister includes high quality images with the listing include at least one quality color image of the face of the ring if possible post a few images including one of the band and one of the setting profile as well t 9 x research source it is better to take a variety of images before you create your ad if there is a cap on the number of images you can use you can always select your best ones later on try shooting the ring under natural lighting and with no visible clutter around it you can use a white towel or sheet to create a neutral backdrop 10 x research source post your online listing decide what marketplaces you want to use to advertise your ring and create a listing write a clear description of the ring that includes appraisal details such as color cut and clarity along with the ring size and the diamond carat size add your images and post your ad 11 x research source if you are using a specialty jewelry auction site such as i do now i don t or worthy they may have you input pre set values about your ring and generate the auction page automatically if you are on a broad platform such as craigslist or ebay you will need to completely create your own ad remember to make sure the contact information associated with your account is up to date typically this will not be displayed directly to potential buyers however this is where the website will send you notifications that someone is interested in your piece take out a print listing newspaper classified ads can help you reach audiences that are not likely to shop online call your local paper and ask about the cost of running different sized ads take out an ad large enough for you to include details like the ring size and the diamond characteristics as well as a photo of the ring 12 x research source let buyers know whether your price is firm or if you are open to negotiation many people who frequent classified ads like to be able to haggle set up your delivery system shipping a diamond ring is not the same as shipping most items the small size and high value of the object means that you want to look for a shipper that can

spreading the word posts and more,define your fashion angle before anything else you need to know what aspect or elements of the fashion world you want to blog about it s a large industry and you don t want to make a pretense of trying to cover the whole thing pick a niche that is of interest to you that you know a lot about and that inspires you to write about keep learning about and share with others 1 x research source while there are many possible ways to break down the fashion angle here are some suggestions just to get you thinking about your own fashion for mid to late teens fashion on the catwalks of europe fashion for office work in big cities fashion for winter vacations fashion for babies and young children fashion on a budget fashion fixes for thrift shop finds etc choose a great name for your blog many good blog names already exist so you ll need to be very imaginative but with a little effort it will be possible to come up with something of your own that stands out spend some time writing out lists of possible names test them on family and friends and mull over the names for a few days before reaching a decision if you re blogging with others do a brainstorm session together 2 x research source keep the name as short as possible without being dull decide on a main theme and layout for the blog while the theme will obviously be focused on fashion it s the design elements you ll need to customize make the design exciting and fun so the viewers will keep coming on the site from the start don t make it too busy but equally don t make it bland find a balance that exudes elegance confidence and simplicity 3 x research source if you re not sure hire a web designer to help you this can be done easily through online sources decide how large your images will be large images are preferred by those using portable digital media as the screens are smaller small images tend to have less impact and important details can be easily lost choose a color theme that your blog will be identified with do you have a main color or set of colors that you think work well for your fashion statement do test runs of different colors and combinations of colors to see what works best for your layout 4 x research source when choosing colors bear in mind the fashion you ll be covering colors connote different meanings such as gold and metallics for sophistication and evening fashion pinks and pastels for girly or children s fashion navy blues and dark colors for work fashion and greens blues and browns for eco fashion choose heading and font styles wisely headers help to break down the text and make for easier reading they also allow you to draw the reader s eye quickly allowing the reader to home in on what he or she is really interested in the headers should match the theme and layout as perfectly as possible as for font style match it your readership while accounting for ease of reading in the online context some fonts are better for a more quirky younger and less sophisticated approach while other fonts are better for the more serious minded do your research before choosing develop some brief but informative statements and name structures it is important that readers can quickly work out what your blog is about and have these form a permanent part of the blog s layout these statements should be short to the point and as catchy interesting as possible the principal ones to develop include the byline under the blog s name usually a one to two liner this should summarize the blog s purpose profile this is the chance to write a glowing background to the purpose of the blog and cool information about those behind it first post this is a great place to explain the future direction of the blog it can be linked on the side bar for those who wish to read it many months or years down the track categories or tags do not neglect the categories or tags you re going to have they need careful selection and naming to make it easy for readers to pull together all posts on a particular topic or theme that interests them don t be too simplistic for example a blog about fashion is a tad too broad be sure to know and decide before you create the blog whether you want this to be your own blog or co run it with multiple people while sharing a blog can reduce the workload considerably and provide lots of interesting opinions there are some key things to consider when making a decision to run a shared blog if you run it with one other person or with multiple people this may turn out harder than you thought this is because you have to constantly coordinate with at least one other person and be certain that he or she is keeping up his or her end of the bargain you don t want to end up being the deadline nag choose someone you can trust if you get in a fight with this friend you will be letting the fans down and may have to delete the blog or let your friend take it over choose someone who is as passionate about fashion as you are and who has a love of sharing ideas about it he or she doesn t need to have the same ideas as you although clashing all the time will cause readers to wonder why you decided to share a blog together if you decide to run the blog yourself realize how much work this will involve for example you are solely responsible for meeting deadlines ensuring that there is sufficient content each week and keeping on top of comments from your readers you must interact with readers or else they will feel that you re not interested in them and they ll soon lose interest you will need to keep coming up with fresh and interesting stories and angles however on the plus side you have complete control and what you say goes start publishing some fashion posts your first post should explain what the blog aims to do and what sort of fashion stories and opinions you ll be adding this post can continue to inform readers to the blog for many years so make it a good one with clear explanations of the intended direction this post can also identify your intentions as to how regularly you ll add posts this is something that should be worked out at the beginning while it can be changed later it should be an indication of serious intent at this point begin adding posts regularly write interesting posts which are fun to read and look at add plenty of images and perhaps include animations videos and other enlivening aspects some things to bear in mind when writing posts keep to your promised blog coverage you won t win over readers by spinning yarns that veer away from the fashion topic for example if you re covering posh fashions and you happen to cover them at the local horse races avoid discussing the merits of betting on horses try to find exciting angles not already covered elsewhere your opinions also matter readers want to read something different from the other blogs and news items about the fashion you re covering use post headers that draw in the reader and make them want to know much more always check your facts don t make things up and don t say mean things about people or you may not only upset your readers but end up defaming people you don t want to do that there are really good books and online information about avoiding such slip ups on blogs check them out be guided by the indications your readers give you if they express a love of something you ve written produce more of it place your name on the blog posts you produce if you re doing a shared blog this allows readers to identify with each author and it helps you to grow your fan base if you run this site with multiple people make it clear that you want equal or close to equal amounts of posts on this blog if someone gets lazy consider a system of warnings before they re ditched completely you don t have the time to be chasing someone constantly change your posts up don t add the same styles and fashions to your blog you can even try setting new trends as well as adding lots of pictures tips and possibly videos you may want some new fashion updates or even contact some of the fans personally to keep them there use plenty of images but be sensible in your usage of them images are the lifeblood of a blog focused on fashion readers will want to see what you re talking about it s really important to do the right thing by images too including if you re taking images of your own use a good camera and know the basics of taking great shots the time taken to learn how to take good images will be paid back tenfold when your blog takes off if using someone else s images be sure you have the permission or the copyright freedom to do so do not pinch pictures from elsewhere or you risk breaching copyright and getting yourself into a stink legal action isn t fun if you have permission make this clear and place any information or notice with the image that the person giving permission requests keep a list of places you can get images from without having to ask for permission provided you re not running the blog for profit this list will end up being quite large however as soon as you start making a profit from your blog you ll need to be even more careful about where you source the images from read all terms and conditions with care consider teeing up with a blog written in another language share images with each other this can allow both of you to source information from different countries and increase the interest in both blogs without having to worry too much about losing readers to one another be regular with new posts readers have short attention spans and if you skip a scheduled posting they ll already be thinking has this blog closed down if you do need to miss posts be courteous and explain ahead of time why this will happen people will understand that you have a life and that your interstate brother s wedding comes before a post being on time 5 x research source spread the word spreading the word is a very important part of running a blog or website successfully 6 x research source get accounts on social media that will promote your blog for example facebook twitter instagram snapchat and pinterest use a program that sends updates to these sites each time that you add a new post to the blog use fun quirky and short lead ins on these sites to entice people to click on the link and come and read your new posts use forums to share blog content post information about your website onto other sites or blogs you can personally tell people about it and tell them to then spread the word and you can even pass out flyers or business cards guest blog where possible try to guest blog on other fashion blogs this increases your outreach to new readers and gets your blog some exposure that will remain ongoing for as long as that blog exists leaves your post intact in turn invite others to blog on your blog too the reciprocity of guest blogging opens up lots of possibilities and spreads the word look at your audience you should be able to see your audience such as the people viewing at the second the people viewed today week month and all time you should see the posts that they have viewed and how many views that post has gotten you may also be able to see what viewers have typed on google or other source sites to get to your blog you may want to do some posts on those sources or keywords traffic sources to get more viewers coming on have lots of updates make sure that you are welcoming your fans instead of driving them away you may want to change the appearance or layout of your blog occasionally to keep it exciting interesting and fresh,Personal-Care-and-Style
how to do a makeup tutorial,makeup tutorials are a popular method of learning and teaching others how to do makeup they are most effective through video since viewers can see exactly how techniques

your recording equipment and software you can create makeup tutorials like a professional,set up your studio a studio for creating tutorials will be very similar to a photography studio your studio can be a corner of a room or if you have the extra space you can dedicate an entire room to be your studio generally speaking the smaller the space the better it will improve the sound quality if you are not using a microphone 1 x research source set up a backdrop if there is a lot of furniture or clutter in the background of your shot this will make your tutorial look more professional you can use a glittery or sparkly background for the holiday season and pastel colors for summer feel free to be creative with choosing your backdrop make sure you have suitable lighting a dark video is not useful to anyone especially for something as detailed as applying makeup ring lights are a popular lighting tool for makeup artists and vloggers 2 x research source obtain camera equipment the best camera for creating makeup tutorials will be a high quality camera such as a dslr which stands for digital single lens reflex point and shoot cameras and camcorders lack image quality and features such as white balance both of which are crucial for filming something as detailed as makeup 3 x research source purchase a tripod if you do not already have one there are short tripods that will sit on a desk and there are tall ones that will stand several feet off the ground be sure to purchase a higher quality tripod since cheaper ones are flimsier and may not support the weight of your camera there are dslr cameras that have a vari angle lcd screen which is a screen that folds out and can face you so that you can make sure you are always in the viewer you can use a phone camera such as the iphone camera it may not be as high quality as a dslr camera but it will do the job and will allow you to make tutorials create an outline it may be helpful to create an outline of your video beforehand so that you remember to do all of the things you intend to do in your tutorial it can be easy to miss a step in the hustle and bustle of filming and it would be a pain to go back and record what you missed save yourself some time in the long run by creating an outline create a transcript if you plan to do voiceovers for your tutorial it can be helpful to write your transcript beforehand this can also help you stay on track during filming so that you are remembering to demonstrate every part you intend to talk about obtain video editing software other than the camera and the video footage itself the video editing software is the most important part of creating tutorials there are usually awkward moments during filming that you may want to edit out and you may also wish to add effects and interesting transitions there are plenty of programs that are available for free and at a cost wevideo is a free relatively easy to use cloud based editing software that allows you to store your video in the cloud rather than on your computer 4 x research source vsdc is a free video editing software available for windows you can use this program to create videos that look professional 5 x research source prepare your makeup before recording prepare your makeup and clean your makeup brushes it won t do you any good to use dirty brushes since it could cause an infection and could taint the colors that you are trying to demonstrate set out the makeup you intend to use on a table or desk near your filming setup pick up a daily brush cleaner from a drug store or a makeup store sephora offers a great brush cleaner that dries quickly and moisturizes the bristles 6 x research source lay out all of your makeup and supplies have your supplies in front of you so that they are easily accessible during filming having your supplies within arm s reach will save you time and prevent you from having to get up and dig around your home to find something you need make sure your makeup and brushes are ready to go before you start recording do a test video before launching into your tutorial do a brief test video it would be frustrating if you recorded an entire tutorial and part of your face was out of the frame make sure that the shot is exactly how you want it to be before you begin recording this may take several attempts record voice and video separately if possible record your voice and video separately so that you can add in and edit audio without altering your video you can use your video editing software to combine your voice and video files into one seamless tutorial after your record your video use a microphone to record your voiceovers following what is laid out in your outline or transcript if you made one microphones can be purchased online or at an electronics store you will want to purchase a microphone that can plug into your computer and record the sound on your desktop such as a usb microphone 7 x research source upload the audio file to your computer when the audio recording is complete upload it to your computer if it has not already been recorded using your computer then upload the file to your video editing software and edit it into your video this varies from program to program but there should be a button or command to import sound files on just about every video editing software demonstrate the steps carefully while you are recording be mindful of the viewers and make sure that you are clearly recording what you are doing you may want to go a bit slower than you are used to to allow viewers to see exactly how the techniques are carried out make sure that you are always in the viewfinder and that the camera is focusing on you makeup requires very small precise movements at times make sure that these are very apparent to the viewers there are many cameras available that come with an autofocus feature which can be quite useful for recording tutorials choose your clip speeds there will be certain areas of the tutorial that you will want to speed up or slow down for example if you are blending out your eyeshadow you may want to speed that portion of the video up so that viewers aren t watching you blend for more than ten seconds this can be quite boring and repetitive for the viewer any clips that could be boring could be edited out or sped up and any clips that show a great amount of detail or precise movements could be slowed down to benefit viewers edit transitions there are times when you don t need to add in transitions between clips such as when you are talking to the camera for a length of time and want to edit out small bits and pieces for something like this adding transitions would be overkill if you are transitioning from one part of the video to another such as the introduction to the makeup tutorial you may want to add in a transition which will help the viewer understand that you are moving into a different part of the video most video editing softwares come with preset transitions these can be fun to experiment with transitions can be as creative or as simple as you would like them to be use them to have fun and create exciting effects in your videos or use a simple one to indicate that you are moving on to the next step with little fanfare for example you can use a transition that makes the current screen spin away making way for the next scene or you can simply have current screen move to the left or right until it disappears from the screen before the next scene pops up add in effects many makeup artists and vloggers enjoy using effects in their videos such as bright flashes or sparkles this can be a fun and whimsical way to show off the finished product some vloggers also add in text which can be done with the editing software the text can be helpful tips or something that was missed upload the video there are plenty of video streaming services available such as vimeo but youtube is a massively popular platform that will allow you to get plenty of views on your video log into your youtube account to upload your video once you are logged in you should be able click on upload in the upper righthand corner follow the prompts and select your video it may take a few minutes to finish uploading,Personal-Care-and-Style

understanding of fashion on the long run if you are planning a career trying to do all at once might get you discouraged learn more if you can it makes good sense to get a diploma or degree in fashion design or a related program you ll learn a great deal make excellent early contacts and have ample opportunity to show off your skills in a less judgmental environment although still be prepared to be critiqued do one or both of the following get a degree in fashion design most programs are three or four years long fidm and parsons are two of the most popular design schools in the united states you

mind as to the type of designing you want to undertake lifelong are you interested most in haute couture ready to wear fitness leisure gear the mass market or niches such as eco wear each has advantages and disadvantages that you ll need to explore before reaching your final decision on which pathway to pursue within these major fields you ll also need to decide on a few sub set areas for your fashion design you might wish to straddle a few but to begin with don t over extend yourself as it s better to perfect your designing within one area and then experiment when you ve already got a good foothold in the industry for example 3 x research source women s daywear women s evening wear men s daywear men s evening wear boys wear and or girls wear teenage wear sportswear fitness leisure wear knitwear outdoor adventure outerwear bridal wear accessories casual costume design for theaters movies the advertising industry and retailers downsize your ego think about real needs prior to think about fame looking cool is fine but it won t sell garments by itself if you are planning to become a fashion designer you will not only make apparel for yourself or for famous people you can t making a living out of that they re not even 1 of the population even though you see big names in magazines it s advertisement not the reality it doesn t work that way designers are especially needed for people with real imperfect bodies that still want to look their best having a snob attitude will blind you from making money reality is you don t design for yourself you design for others ask your customers what they need be realistic if you happen to live in a very warm country you will have a tough time selling ski jackets look around you what do real people need and want for example if you plan on designing a complete collection you will need more tops that bottoms because most people have more tops than bottoms in their wardrobe in general tops are great to change your looks while a plain nice fitting pant will match most of your tops keep it simple and realistic extravagant sketches are nice on paper but great tops and jeans will sell out in more interesting numbers than evening dresses 4 x research source make concessions mass market may not sound as glamour as evening or luxury wear but it will get you a long way and pay your groceries if you have to create a style that will be produced more than a hundred times you need to make it right from the start it will improve your designing skills as you will have to understand perfectly the garment you are about to sell bad styles will get you returns and cost quite a bunch of money to your boss 5 x research source get inspiration from your competitors observe and note the fabric they are using the zipper size they use for their garments to be strong enough for its usage fabric quality for its properties such as impermeability comfort breathability or care colours that sells in your country starting from your competitors qualities is not copying it s observation with taking the best of every pieces and analyzing it you will understand what makes a favorite piece of clothing they are usually best sellers your customers whether they are buyers for stores or regular people want something that looks good on them in the first place extravagant pieces are worn only a few days a year they re great but they may not bring you a salary to live with plan some key pieces what is your absolute strength in designing perhaps you re a whizz at accessories or a genius with yoga pants your passion and skill are an important first part of the equation of course the second part is matching this to what the market wants which in fashion is part convincing the market and part noticing what the market is demanding assess your skills and personality honestly before pursuing a career in fashion design you may love clothes but clothing is only part of the story when undertaking fashion design you ll also need excellent communication skills a willingness to work very hard often 24 7 a tough hide when criticized an ability to cope with stress openness to having many different clients and or bosses an acceptance that there will be loneliness or isolation on occasion depending on how you set up your design business or career and an ability to be a self disciplined self starter being a fashion designer is probably for you if you want to devote your life to this career it s your vocation you don t mind uncertainty or insecurity you are willing to stand up for what you believe in you have distinct ideas about what is important in fashion you listen to clients well you know the fashion industry inside out and you live eat and breathe fashion being a fashion designer is probably not for you if you can t manage stress well you don t like uncertainty or instability you want a career without too many highs or lows you need other people to praise your efforts you need a lot of guidance you hate being financially unstable and you have too many other interests in life get educated about the business side of fashion being a successful fashion designer not only requires talent and creativity it also requires a sound knowledge of the business and marketing aspects of the fashion world keep yourself updated on the happenings in the fashion industry by regularly reading trade journals like women s wear daily and daily news record many fashion design programs include courses in marketing some programs majors highlight marketing more than others so be sure to do ample research on the coursework involved in the program you choose if you ve already undertaken a course but missed the marketing financial side of things consider doing short courses in these aspects of business learn beyond design there is an entire supply chain involved in the fashion industry and you need to understand what each person s job is so that you can see things from their perspective too in order to make compromises meet demands and understand where things get held up research what others do such as buyers merchandisers pattern cutters garment and fabric technologists quality controllers graders sample machinists sales people pr and marketing people fashion journalists retailers event organizers fashion stylists and so forth know your customer this skill is basic and essential and it s one a fashion designer must never lose sight of know how much your customers spend what their lifestyles are where they like to shop how they like to shop and what they like and dislike know what are absolute needs and what are the things that only get bought when disposable incomes are less tight if you have done marketing you should have a solid understanding of how to work out customers needs know your competitors always keep an eye on what other fashion designers in your area of interest are doing at a minimum keep up better still surpass them while still meeting your customers needs trade fairs are an excellent place to develop deeper understanding of how the fashion industry works and what will work for you in terms of meeting customer needs and staying competitive look for fashion design jobs there are various ways to find work in the fashion industry as a designer and it depends on the type of designing you re interested in in some cases being versatile will help you a great deal just so that you get the experience and then jump across to your real passion later and in most cases you ll need to be persistent and apply to many different places to get your foot in the door for starters some places to apply to include existing fashion houses and designers look for internships entry level paid positions assistants to designers etc costume positions with movie studios theaters costume stores etc online advertisements through various online job agencies word of mouth use your college or fashion industry contacts to get you through the door in an industry that values what people who already are well positioned have to say this is a good way to get started if running your own design business be prepared to be financially astute you may be exceptionally creative but be absolutely certain that if you run your own fashion label you need to be business savvy you do need to understand those numbers and the invoices that keep piling up on your table if you really hate this stuff there are good options such as asking your accountant to take care of all things financial but it still pays to keep on top of the whole thing yourself and if you really really hate this side of it look for work as a fashion designer with a fashion house instead of running your own label 6 x research source what type of trader will you be there are many possibilities including sole trader partnership incorporated company etc each has distinct advantages and disadvantages that you should discuss with your legal and financial advisers before proceeding be sure that you are covered for liability in all circumstances especially if you re in a particularly litigious culture be realistic you may need to be willing to move to match your market but that depends on how you work and sell being realistic means recognizing that it s pointless trying to sell a lot of haute couture to people who only want career clothing in a semi rural town while it s no good trying to sell bikini to the inuit you ll need to focus on where your market is most likely to be and either work out whether it s best for you to live and work in that same area or how to get the distribution from your current area to the place where it s most likely to sell take into consideration the influences around you as a creative person part of your creative process is being around like people and sparking off their ideas and suggestions too it s a lot harder to do this alone or working alongside people who aren t into your fashion approaches remember too that seasonality impacts fashion designing and may have an impact on the type of clothing you re producing and where you wish to sell it consider the power of online selling provided you use good quality three dimensional images that can be zoomed and turned selling your fashion online to anywhere in the world is another realistic possibility nowadays this allows you greater flexibility in where you ll live and design and can reduce the daily commute to zero this may be ideal if you plan on staying a small fashion label even then however you should still make allowances for traveling to major fashion shows living in a city with a thriving fashion industry makes good sense for many designers according to the global language monitor glm the following cities were the top fashion capitals of the world in 2012 in descending order 7 x research source london england new york us barcelona spain paris france mexico city madrid spain rome italy sao palo brazil milan italy los

how to prepare a fashion design portfolio,every aspiring fashion designer will have to make a design portfolio at some point but with so many pieces and so few guidelines where do you even begin it can be hard to get started but once you know what admissions committees and hiring managers are looking for and how you want to organize your work you ll be much better equipped to create your own amazing design portfolio,check for instructions or guidance on what to include if you re applying to a design program they should give a good idea of what they want to see in your portfolio if you re designing a professional portfolio you may not have explicit directions generally you should include creative investigation drawings that show your ability to translate 3d into 2d color studies and if relevant photos of 3d work that you ve done 1 x research source do tailor your portfolio to the specific application or the type of work that you want to do you may want to put together more than one portfolio if you re applying for different positions come up with an organizing principle whatever you do you should probably try to keep different parts of one project together as much as possible so for example if you explored organic structures like feathers and leaves for one project and tribal or folk art for another try to keep the various parts of those projects together ultimately you need an organizational principle because you ll have to choose how you want to present those projects 2 x research source do you want to tell a story showing the links between the different angles you have explored do you prefer the simplicity of chronological or reverse chronological order think about the work that you ve done and see if there are any particular connections that you want to highlight remember that whatever you come up with it should be clear to a viewer what you re trying to communicate if you re really unsure about this just stick with something simple like presenting your most recent work at the front to capture the viewer and then dedicating the rest of the portfolio to showing how you got there note that for professional portfolios you should arrange your work with the most recent pieces first and put older material in the back write an explanation to show how you want to organize your work as with any project it s easy to become so enthusiastic about an idea that you don t really plan out how you re going to execute it before you know it you re overwhelmed by everything you didn t plan for the point of this step is to make sure that you ve maximized the presentation of your work and that all the parts will be as clear to an outsider as they are to you don t just think about what your storyline is assess how each part fits into that story play around with different arrangements and think about how each arrangement affects how your works will be perceived you may create a diagram or an outline to illustrate why you organized your pieces in a certain way show or explain your idea to someone who has worked with you throughout your creative development ideally that person should be a mentor such as a teacher or someone close to you who has some experience with building portfolios and can provide feedback on how effective your ideas will be gather your materials base your materials on the guidelines provided by your specific program color samples fabric swatches investigative pieces sketches photos everything you re not going to put all of these items into your portfolio but do start with the complete collection note that you usually can t include actual pieces that you ve made like a corset or a pair of a shoes instead have professional looking photos taken of those pieces and include the photographs in your portfolio as exhibits of your work showcase your strongest ideas you may not have the resources to make what you re designing or you may not have all of the skills yet that s okay the person looking at your portfolio wants to see how you think and create so show them your pen and ink sketches or your charcoal drawings you need to have a couple of different examples of your work represented as well as figure drawings that will demonstrate your ability to represent three dimensions on a two dimensional surface anything more than that is bonus material 3 x research source pick out a selection of pieces that show your development in each of your projects these pieces may be a combination of things that have inspired you early work that you did or first steps in a developed idea that will reappear later try to pick out two or three pieces for each project that you ve explored do include casual side projects if you re not making a targeted professional portfolio these unofficial works show the diversity and range of your talents plus they offer some insight into your interests if you have a large volume of work try to select primarily from your most recent explorations include some of your older work to show your development but emphasize where you re at right now especially if you re making your portfolio for professional advancement select your best pieces you definitely want to include your best work in your portfolio aim to have between one and two pieces of really high quality work per project go for pieces that represent your personal style and approach to design maybe you tend to focus on designing for a certain demographic young fashion forward women androgynous men active children etc or around a certain theme you may then include pieces that illustrate your ideal customer or consumer you may select pieces that have also been well regarded in your design classes and considered some of your best work by professors and peers make sure that these works incorporate a range of different types of styles or approaches to fabric and materials you shouldn t include more than two pieces from one style or approach for example maybe you have two pieces that showcase your ability to work with leather you should also include one to two pieces that show off your ability to work with a different material like silk or jersey this will illustrate that you are able to work with several different materials and in several different styles fit the pieces together into your chosen arrangement you may want to begin by laying things out side by side or on a table just to play with the order if you choose to have separate sections for each category figure out how you want to organize the pieces within a particular section 4 x research source ask yourself questions like does a chronological order make sense do you have clusters of works that you should group together by subject or by medium if you discover that something doesn t fit well with your arrangement don t include it see if you have a different piece works better with the other parts of the section you want everything in your portfolio to fit well together buy or find a portfolio or presentation case you can find both portfolios and presentation cases online or at good art supply stores especially if you already live near an art or design school which one you need will depend on the pieces you re presenting the case should be neat and clean but if you re a student it doesn t need to be high end as long as it is functional and effectively displays or stores your works you may want to invest in a nicer case if you are presenting your portfolio in a professional setting 5 x research source presentation cases are like zip binders in that they generally include sheet protectors and are best for smaller works they are literally meant to present your work so they re probably your best option if you re just starting out if you have larger pieces like paintings you may want to invest in a portfolio which is larger and intended more for transporting works than for presenting them rather than presenting your works in a ring binder style setting you ll probably end up with loose sheets and works stacked together securely inside collage loose supplemental items together and glue them onto good paper often your investigative pieces like interesting textures or

a modeling agency manager wear what others tell you many promotional modeling gigs require brand identifying outfits or costumes if they don t give you clothes to wear they usually want you to dress in a particular way you should always check into the type of clothes required for the gig before signing a contract if you re uncomfortable with what is required of you back out for example many beverage girl gigs require revealing dresses or tight outfits since these girls are usually hired to promote alcohol at events with men present the commitment to such outfits might inspire flirtation if you are uncomfortable with attention like this you shouldn t sign up maintain an active stance you can t just stand there and look pretty promotional models have to be energetic outgoing and interactive they aren t like the models on game shows who just stand still and press buttons the goal of most promotional gigs is to pass out samples or flyers often getting consumer information in return you must be able to get people involved in events and get them excited enough about products to purchase them you should be able to enjoy yourself in crowds if you look like you re having fun the consumer will too find reliable transportation since many promotional models must travel to events making sure you don t rely on public transportation or a lemon car is key on top of this you will

how to pose like a model,looking like a model is one thing but models don t get paid to just sit there and look pretty their success in the business comes down to how well they can pose and give the photographer interesting and marketable shots whether you want to enhance your career as a model or just be more photogenic the following tips will help add new dimensions to your shots,slouch a little but hold your head high there are a few times when you ll need to throw your shoulders back for a shot but generally a little slouch makes your pose look natural and relaxed that doesn t mean you should hunch over although this will work with some high fashion shots if you re standing put uneven weight on your feet and the leg with less weight will naturally bend a little you ll look more comfortable and your posture will appear more natural don t slouch so much though that it makes your stomach look bigger 1 x research source by slouch we mean be natural most people aren t aware they re slouching when they are so don t take your natural slouch and multiply it think casually but with your head high you want to elongate your neck as much as possible imagine a string holding up your forehead be strong from head to toe your entire body needs to have life to it think of a dancer not a single part of her body isn t engaged while she s dancing even if she s standing in position no part of you should be a limp noodle start by engaging your core this will help suck you in too and then engage your limbs strong doesn t mean aggressive or masculine in this context it just means with conviction or with energy you want to convey a feeling through the camera after all be asymmetrical for a more interesting shot make sure that you re doing something different with each side of your body you can be dramatic and do something totally different with each of your limbs and tilt your head to the side if it matches the feel of the shoot being asymmetrical can be as simple as dipping one shoulder or hip making sure that your arms are at different heights or bending one leg a little or a lot more than the other remember you re part of a picture this photo isn t about how gosh dang pretty you are it s about the aestheticism of the photo even with the best make up and hair in the world if you don t create pleasing angles the photo won t be as stellar as it could be point your nose away from the camera looking at the camera straight on can work in some dramatic shots but generally it s better to put your face at an angle and look at the camera from that angle tilt your nose a little up or down a little left or right but keep your gaze on that camera 2 x research source learn which angles flatter your face the most do you have a great jawline tilt your head up and to the side a little experiment in front of a mirror or with your own camera to see which angles make the most interesting shots on your face 3 x research source know which direction the light is coming from remember that light will cast shadows and even if they are slight they will affect the appearance of your face if light is coming from the top tilting your nose down may cause your browbone to cast a shadow over your eyes which is good if you re going for a sinister shot but not good if you re trying to look friendly look everywhere while an interesting shot can be had by looking at the camera you have many more options if you look elsewhere what s going on over there is she staring in the mirror does she see a leprechaun is she talking to the queen of england everyone will want to know be careful of the clichéd staring off into the distance look at best you ll look existential and at worse you ll look like you re trying to be existential by staring off into the distance use this gaze minimally quarter out kinda like the last tip just eluded to quartering out will make you look as slim as possible is she facing forward is she facing to the side just how wide is her waist no one will know stick to a 3 4 angle to appear the slimmest going head on into anything will make you the most vulnerable and exposed that goes for real life too if you quarter out which side is your good side emphasize that one to get the best photo remember your hands possibly the most awkward part of modeling is knowing what to do with your hands they re just there hanging awkwardly if you stay engaged head to toe though hopefully you ll find poses that feel right that make sense the only thing you should not do is put them around your face hello bad 1980s glamour shot a good rule of thumb is to show the side of your hand this creates the longest thinnest line extending from your arm 4 x research source it also avoids the are my hands aging fear and the do my palms look funny worry have the perfect smile there is an art to posing with a perfect smile and most good models know how to do this naturally it is a smile that is halfway between the biggest smile you can make and no smile at all the lips are slightly parted and only the upper teeth are showing the smile is considered a gentle smile the result should look pleasant and relaxed generally smiling will lift the cheeks and narrow the eyes so try to relax your eyes so that they are opened and the whites are showing this may take some practice in front of a mirror to isolate the different muscle groups however it will be worth the effort whether you are a model or someone just looking to improve your portraits mastering the perfect smile can make major improvements to your shots create an intensity being a deer in headlights or just plain looking bored is not an interesting statement on non conformity a new take on the materialism of the fashion industry or at all endearing it s just awkward when your image is captured you have to feel something the camera can catch it ll depend on the shoot but whatever it is create it feel it reek of emotion the only non abstract way to put this is to use your eyes it s super easy to smile with only your mouth or do a pose with your body and forget that your face doesn t match if you re unsure what you should be feeling how is your body cuing you are you strong and confident are you happy and carefree as tyra says smize 5 x research source translation smile with your eyes be tasteful in some of the clothes you might choose to wear it would be easy to feel a little naughty regardless of what you re wearing in most circumstances it s best not to look predatory a good model should be about sophistication and class even if you re in a teeny bikini think casually your body will emphasize your beauty enough your face and pose don t have to also mix it up constantly you should be changing poses roughly every three seconds a photographer will not want to waste time taking the same photo over and over and over even if you re unsure that you look good go for it you ll get a lot of options to choose from when you re done some of them are bound to look great feel free to go a little crazy if your poses are unique you ll be memorable keep the techniques you know working in angles etc but switch them up with minute variations and a little can go a long way hide your flaws everybody has em even size 000 7 ft tall dutch models have em odds are you re aware of them too the good news is that there is surely a way to hide them not that they re not wonderful just not ideal for the camera 5 x research source if you put your hands on your hips it ll create the illusion of a smaller waist the holes between your arms and body create a background that removes emphasis from that area do this in real life too keep your chin up to reduce your forehead the opposite goes for big chins not only will keeping your chin appear strong and hide your forehead but it ll also elongate your neck turn a knee in to get slimmer hips oh that elusive thigh gap that most women don t have but if you turn your knee in it ll help you get there and your hips will look smaller if you turn your body to the side but square your shoulders your hips will look a lot smaller it s like you re facing forward but you only get the majority of your hips practice get a digital camera set up a tripod and take thousands of shots since viewing the shots on your computer screen costs nothing there s really no excuse not to practice you should know which poses work for you and which don t learn which poses flatter which parts of your body become familiar with which poses work with various types of clothing some poses emphasize the clean lines of a power suit while others emphasize the flow of a gown practice with props like a chair or holding objects a vase a rope a beach ball whatever be creative you never know what you ll be asked to do study look at magazines and brochures with a critical eye make note of how the model is posing what is she doing with her hands limbs head eyes lips what emotion does the pose convey find your favorite model and analyze her how does she walk how does she hold herself in general what are her go to poses while you don t want to be a mimicry do pay attention to her habits to get you started listen to your photographer a good photographer will offer feedback and hopefully be quite frank telling you what to do so they can get the shot they want be cooperative and gracious and graceful don t allow yourself to get nervous or else you will tense up and look stiff relax into each pose and connect with the camera take into consideration the type of shoot you re doing if it s fashion modeling you ll probably be asked to take on those angular avant garde poses that look a little strange and forced if it s commercial modeling you ll want to look casual and everyday think a jean paul gaultier ad versus an ad for aveeno breathe sometimes when we concentrate or when we re nervous we slow or speed up our breathing dramatically you might even find yourself holding your breath for a shot remain conscious of your breathing keep it normal and relaxed this step is super important your breathing can actually determine your mood thus determining your poses if you breathe quickly that cues your body that you re ready for fight or flight imagine what you ll pose like when those thoughts are racing through your subconscious don t worry your look some designers have pretty ridiculous visions that may leave you thinking something along the lines of i look like lucille ball just rolled out of bed and got attacked by a reindeer well that s what they were going for apparently so you ve no choice but to rock it put it aside you re still you you ve still got it remember how we said before that you are one part of an image the photo is about you sure but it s also about the clothes you re wearing the backdrop and the feel of the photo if you don t like your makeup hair or outfit model through it you ve still got the smile the poses and the techniques visualize a motivation or feeling this may help you capture the emotion that you need for a shot if the photographer is looking for a melancholic shot for example imagine a melancholic episode from your life you may find that you re better able to channel your inner melancholia that way if visiting your own past hits a little too close to home think of the plot of an applicable movie and put yourself into the actress shoes the thought process should take over your face and body creating an intensity for the photo,Personal-Care-and-Style

would draw users to your channel such as guitar acoustic or playing naked set up a wishlist on a website like amazon while tips are the main way you ll make money you can also be rewarded in other ways such as when customers buy items off your wishlist and send them to you you can put anything you want on your wishlist set it to public and then post it on your profile 8 x research source make sure to keep your address private when creating the list also it s a good idea to set up a po box to help keep your own address anonymous decide what you re willing to do before you go live you need to have boundaries as customers will ask you to do all kinds of things you can say no to whatever you want but you should decide ahead of time what you feel okay doing and what you don t feel okay doing 9 x research source for instance you may be willing to do partial nudity but not full nudity you may be willing to perform certain sexual acts but not others or you may decide you don t want to

traffic is higher 10 x research source after working a while you will likely be able to gauge better when traffic is going to be higher focus on your personality to draw people in looks are far less important than your personality no matter what you look like someone out there will find you attractive however most successful webcammers gain followers by being themselves and engaging customers in conversations 11 x research source you can have a hook like putting on makeup reading books or even eating but you can also just sit and chat with people think of the people on the other end as your friends and just chat to the camera like you re chatting to them use your customers responses to keep the conversation going when they respond to what you re saying by text read it out loud and respond on camera watch your customers requests to increase your chances of tips while you re online your customers may make requests of you some of these may be sexual though not all of them will be for instance some people may want you to do something as simple as sing a song 12 x research source depending on the website customers may pay more to go to a private chat you still have control over what you do though develop relationships with your customers you don t have to or probably even want to for safety s sake give out your number or home address however you will likely develop regular customers who visit often while webcamming is sexual it s also just about hanging out with a group of people for several hours talk to them and respond to their questions as much as you re able 13 x research source try not to get discouraged when you don t make as many tips it takes time to build up followers and you re going to have days when you don t make anything at all however if you re consistently having those days you may want to rethink how you re running your channel have fun while you re on camera try not to look like you re bored out of your mind that turns customers off on the other hand trying too hard can be just as much of a turnoff generally customers are looking for real people just being themselves so just enjoy yourself and have fun 14 x research source if you re not a bouncy flirty person that s fine however you should show some enthusiasm for what you re doing treat your customers with kindness as if you re talking to a friend that is the people who get on these sites tend to either by dedicated to their work or unhappily married the common factor is they re lonely so try things like asking how their day is going or what was good about work 15 x

traffic as customers are always interested in something different plus you can share lighting and other background equipment as needed 17 x research source try talking to other models in their shows however keep in mind that because the industry is so competitive it may take a while to find other people who are receptive to the idea you could also try finding people on social media and online forums sharing rent and other expenses will help keep your bills low run contests to drive traffic and tips contests can be anything you want them to be for instance you can pledge to write a song for the highest bidder or run a contest to see if you should cut your hair or not have people vote for either side by tipping you so that you make money off the contest of course it has to be something you re willing to do and something that intrigues your customer base 18 x research source raffle off items to earn extra money the items can be whatever you want from something they see on camera all the time a candle to even things like a date or your underwear you can also sell items on the side such as photo sets or videos capitalize on what your customers seem to want 19 x research source to

how to pose like a model,looking like a model is one thing but models don t get paid to just sit there and look pretty their success in the business comes down to how well they can pose and give the photographer interesting and marketable shots whether you want to enhance your career as a model or just be more photogenic the following tips will help add new dimensions to your shots,slouch a little but hold your head high there are a few times when you ll need to throw your shoulders back for a shot but generally a little slouch makes your pose look natural and relaxed that doesn t mean you should hunch over although this will work with some high fashion shots if you re standing put uneven weight on your feet and the leg with less weight will naturally bend a little you ll look more comfortable and your posture will appear more natural don t slouch so much though that it makes your stomach look bigger 1 x research source by slouch we mean be natural most people aren t aware they re slouching when they are so don t take your natural slouch and multiply it think casually but with your head high you want to elongate your neck as much as possible imagine a string holding up your forehead be strong from head to toe your entire body needs to have life to it think of a dancer not a single part of her body isn t engaged while she s dancing even if she s standing in position no part of you should be a limp noodle start by engaging your core this will help suck you in too and then engage your limbs strong doesn t mean aggressive or masculine in this context it just means with conviction or with energy you want to convey a feeling through the camera after all be asymmetrical for a more interesting shot make sure that you re doing something different with each side of your body you can be dramatic and do something totally different with each of your limbs and tilt your head to the side if it matches the feel of the shoot being asymmetrical can be as simple as dipping one shoulder or hip making sure that your arms are at different heights or bending one leg a little or a lot more than the other remember you re part of a picture this photo isn t about how gosh dang pretty you are it s about the aestheticism of the photo even with the best make up and hair in the world if you don t create pleasing angles the photo won t be as stellar as it could be point your nose away from the camera looking at the camera straight on can work in some dramatic shots but generally it s better to put your face at an angle and look at the camera from that angle tilt your nose a little up or down a little left or right but keep your gaze on that camera 2 x research source learn which angles flatter your face the most do you have a great jawline tilt your head up and to the side a little experiment in front of a mirror or with your own camera to see which angles make the most interesting shots on your face 3 x research source know which direction the light is coming from

shadow over your eyes which is good if you re going for a sinister shot but not good if you re trying to look friendly look everywhere while an interesting shot can be had by looking at the camera you have many more options if you look elsewhere what s going on over there is she staring in the mirror does she see a leprechaun is she talking to the queen of england everyone will want to know be careful of the clichéd staring off into the distance look at best you ll look existential and at worse you ll look like you re trying to be existential by staring off into the distance use this gaze minimally quarter out kinda like the last tip just eluded to quartering out will make you look as slim as possible is she facing forward is she facing to the side just how wide is her waist no one will know stick to a 3 4 angle to appear the slimmest going head on into anything will make you the most vulnerable and exposed that goes for real life too if you quarter out which side is your good side emphasize that one to get the best photo remember your hands possibly the most awkward part of modeling is knowing what to do with your hands they re just there hanging awkwardly if you stay engaged head to toe though hopefully you ll find poses that feel right that make sense the only thing you should not do is put them around your face hello bad 1980s glamour shot a good rule of thumb is to show the side of your hand this creates the longest thinnest line extending from your arm 4 x research source it also avoids the are my hands aging fear and the do my palms look funny worry have the perfect smile there is an art to posing with a perfect smile and most good models know how to do this naturally it is a smile that is halfway between the biggest smile you can make and no smile at all the lips are slightly parted and only the upper teeth are showing the smile is considered a gentle smile the result should look pleasant and relaxed generally smiling will lift the cheeks and narrow the eyes so try to relax your eyes so that they are opened and the whites are showing this may take some practice in front of a mirror to isolate the different muscle groups however it will be worth the effort whether you are a model or someone just looking to improve your portraits mastering the perfect smile can make major improvements to your shots create an intensity being a deer in headlights or just plain looking bored is not an interesting statement on non conformity a new take on the materialism of the fashion industry or at all endearing it s just awkward when your image is captured you have to feel something the camera can catch it ll depend on the shoot but whatever it is create it feel it reek of emotion the only non abstract way to put this is to use your eyes it s super easy to smile with only your mouth or do a pose with your body and forget that your face doesn t match if you re unsure what you should be feeling how is your body cuing you are you strong and confident are you happy and carefree as tyra says smize 5 x research source translation smile with your eyes be tasteful in some of the clothes you might choose to wear it would be easy to feel a little naughty regardless of what you re wearing in most circumstances it s best not to look predatory a good model should be about sophistication and class even if you re in a teeny bikini think casually your body will emphasize your beauty enough your face and pose don t have to also mix it up constantly you should be changing poses roughly every three seconds a photographer will not want to waste time taking the same photo over and over and over even if you re unsure that you look good go for it you ll get a lot of options to choose from when you re done some of them are bound to look great feel free to go a little crazy if your poses are unique you ll be memorable keep the techniques you know working in angles etc but switch them up with minute variations and a little can go a long way hide your flaws everybody has em even size 000 7 ft tall dutch models have em odds are you re aware of them too the good news is that there is surely a way to hide them not that they re not wonderful just not ideal for the camera 5 x research source if you put your hands on your hips it ll create the illusion of a smaller waist the holes between your arms and body create a background that removes emphasis from that area do this in real life too keep your chin up to reduce your forehead the opposite goes for big chins not only will keeping your chin appear strong and hide your forehead but it ll also elongate your neck turn a knee in to get slimmer hips oh that elusive thigh gap that most women don t have but if you turn your knee in it ll help you get there and your hips will look smaller if you turn your body to the side but square your shoulders your hips will look a lot smaller it s like you re facing forward but you only get the majority of your hips practice get a digital camera set up a tripod and take thousands of shots since viewing the shots on your computer screen costs nothing there s really no excuse not to practice you should know which poses work for you and which don t learn which poses flatter which parts of your body become familiar with which poses work with various types of clothing some poses emphasize the clean lines of a power suit while others emphasize the flow of a gown practice with props like a chair or holding objects a vase a rope a beach ball whatever be creative you never know what you ll be asked to do study look at magazines and brochures with a critical eye make note of how the model is posing what is she doing with her hands limbs head eyes lips what emotion does the pose convey find your favorite model and analyze her how does she walk how does she hold herself in general what are her go to poses while you don t want to be a mimicry do pay attention to her habits to get you started listen to your photographer a good photographer will offer feedback and hopefully be quite frank telling you what to do so they can get the shot they want be cooperative and gracious and graceful don t allow yourself to get nervous or else you will tense up and look stiff relax into each pose and connect with the camera take into consideration the type of shoot you re doing if it s fashion modeling you ll probably be asked to take on those angular avant garde poses that look a little strange and forced if it s commercial modeling you ll want to look casual and everyday think a jean paul gaultier ad versus an ad for aveeno breathe sometimes when we concentrate or when we re nervous we slow or speed up our breathing dramatically you might even find yourself holding your breath for a shot remain conscious of your breathing keep it normal and relaxed this step is super important your breathing can actually determine your mood thus determining your poses if you breathe quickly that cues your body that you re ready for fight or flight imagine what you ll pose like when those thoughts are racing through your subconscious don t worry your look some designers have pretty ridiculous visions that may leave you thinking something along the lines of i look like lucille ball just rolled out of bed and got attacked by a reindeer well that s what they were going for apparently so you ve no choice but to rock it put it aside you re still you you ve still got it remember how we said before that you are one part of an image the photo is about you sure but it s also about the clothes you re wearing the backdrop and the feel of the photo if you don t like your makeup hair or outfit model through it you ve still got the smile the poses and the techniques visualize a motivation or feeling this may help you capture the emotion that you need for a shot if the photographer is looking for a melancholic shot for example imagine a melancholic episode from your life you may find that you re better able to channel your inner melancholia that way if visiting your own past hits a little too close to home think of the plot of an applicable movie and put yourself into the actress shoes the thought process should take over your face and body creating an intensity for the photo,Personal-Care-and-Style

how to mentally prepare for a career in modeling,if you re serious about preparing yourself mentally for modeling you will need to consider things from a very pragmatic and well informed angle it isn t all glamor in fact a lot of of it extremely unglamorous and most of what you ll be doing is about advertising products not being a beauty icon so hitch up your thinking skills and prepare yourself for modeling as a career in a way that protects you and your interests,consider whether you really do want to do modeling as a career it s a tough job that comes with long hours many demands and a paucity of work until you re considered bankable even then for many models it s a short lived career and winning a few talent shows isn t the same as living a modeling career so be sure you re truly ready for what it will involve even if you already think you ve got what it takes read biographies by models and those in the modeling industry some of what is out there isn t pretty to read about but you should be aware of go into this industry with your eyes wide open 1 x research source for example read the vogue factor by kirstie clements it will help inform you about some of the issues models face along with magazine and publishing expectations read fashion magazines to know what is current apart from that you won t learn much else do not rely on the glamor shots in these publications as an indication of what modeling is all about there is much more involved than looking amazing which can take hours of effort in itself modeling is hard work often challenging and at times will likely force you to cross your comfort zone as you are expected to perform in ways that might scare of or overwhelm you for example you might have to deal with jobs that include heights walking quickly in high heels down many stairs holding scary animals diving into deep water wearing clothing you feel exposed in and so forth you just never know what stunts you may be asked to cope with however these experiences can present a fun challenge if you have the right mindset only you can make that choice do your research to find a good agency there are good agencies and there are also shoddy agencies as with many other career assistance out there research the agency online and find comments others have left also ask existing and past models for their opinions best of all find a mentor who can guide you in making good decisions including which agency to use preferably choose someone who has been in the modeling industry or associated with it such as a magazine editor fashion writer etc for decades find financial information about the agency is the company solvent does it have a good financial reputation does the agency have a good reputation in general which models are already with the agency what clients does the agency attract read the fine print of anything you sign with an agency see below know what you re getting yourself into treat your portfolio in the same way as a resume it is your brand your promise and your ticket to new work opportunities be sure to have complete control over the brand you re presenting if you do not know how to get this aspect right speak to people who can assist you to do it properly again be guided by your mentor or adviser on the right places to get assistance from look at other model s portfolios what do you see that is effective and what do you see that doesn t work avoid copying but do be ready to use the general ideas of what is a good portfolio aim for a unique presentation and look use a commercial photographer with a great reputation to prepare excellent shots of you for the portfolio there are reputable courses and portfolio producers but they are not a promise of work participating in courses and getting a portfolio together can only start you on your way be wary of paying for work opportunities paying for courses is one thing but not for the modeling jobs themselves and if you do pay for courses get advice first and ask previous students if the course was value for money work on your confidence every person who wants to work for someone else has to get used to doing interviews this isn t anything new what is different is that you need to present a brand your appearance as well as your skill set if you act confident even if you don t feel it this will help you to grow in confidence knock backs are inevitable but they do not need to diminish your self worth unless you permit this work on your assertiveness in this industry you will need to speak up politely there is no space for a diva who argues all the time or a pipsqueak who doesn t say anything until her or his hair is on fire from that crazy fire shoot find an assertive balance that lets you be heard and that gets you known as the person who will speak up when needed in constructive ways without resorting to complaints and always willing to use initiative to overcome difficulties remind yourself that clients are after a certain look and the reality is that won t be your look all of the time however you can help yourself by refining your niche such as choosing swimwear catwalk or fashion shoots because you have the look that the specific niche is after work on developing a natural look that doesn t rely on makeup treat makeup as an enhancement the simple fact is that many clients will book you based on your natural self expecting makeup to enhance what they already like about your look poise and style don t overdo the makeup for interviews keep your hair natural too no obvious hair product in it this lets the stylists see the potential for your hair without artifices in the way wear neat casual clothing that isn t out of keeping with current fashion simple clothing that shows your silhouette shape and look is best know your client all job seekers must know the company s background mission and achievements it is no different for modeling except that you will need to check this background information out more frequently fortunately the internet makes this easy do not neglect to do this homework knowing the background to the product or service and what the ethos of the company you re modeling for can help win you the job as you ll reveal a better understanding of what s expected than models who have failed to do their homework expect rejection it is a standard part of the industry pick yourself up each time learn from it and realize that you often just don t have the right look for that particular campaign or show it is not that you aren t a good model it s simply that clients are free to choose from many types of models male female transgender and this is just part of what modeling is all about if you give up early on then this isn t the right job for you expect challenging situations to arise be prepared not ambushed sometimes there will be lecherous advantage taking and backstabbing people in the industry just as there will be people you can trust avoid seeing everyone as a potential untrustworthy person but keep your wits about you consider the following how will you fend off unwanted sexual advances sexual harassment while it is to be hoped you will never have to do this do not be naive for example if you sense something isn t right about a situation or person s expectations of you put yourself ahead of the job always report sexual harassment to your agency and the police consider what you will do to avoid unsafe situations for example if there is a suggestion that you turn up to a photo shoot alone and in the middle of nowhere ask why it is so secretive and if you don t like the explanation or your agency cannot satisfy you that it s safe turn down the job if you re under 18 always have a chaperone such as a your parent or an older sibling if you re in your late teens and 20s a chaperone still won t hurt until you know enough about the industry and have the phone numbers for the police and people you trust on speed dial on your cellphone and always take the phone with you consider how you will cope with the pressure to be pin thin the extent of thinness expected will vary depending on the type of modeling you choose to do for example paris thin for the catwalk can be alarmingly thin while many fashion beauty editorial and sports shoots may be a healthier slim weight plus size modeling is also an option you need to make up your own mind about losing weight for modeling but you do need to face this expectation rather than hoping it won t be an issue ultimately if it gets to the point that you re starving yourself constantly you ll have no energy you won t be a healthy role model for women or men who see your image and it can most certainly end up damaging your health consider what you will do if you re asked to wear promote something that conflicts with your personal beliefs or values what if you have an ethical dilemma about the company whose product or service you re promoting what if you re asked to do a photo shoot that you find clashes with your beliefs these ethical or moral issues may confront you and it is a good idea to know ahead of time what you will choose to do some people might say it s all part of the job and suck it up while others might say that your longer term values that allow you to sleep well at night matter more you decide do not sign a contract without reading it first even better have someone with legal or contract vetting knowledge read it over for you first ask questions before signing and be sure you understand both the terms and conditions of the contract and any verbal explanations you are offered beware any changes made to the contract in handwriting with crossing out or changes to what is usually a standard contract if you do not understand the contract do not be bullied into signing it if someone makes a comment that plenty of others are willing to sign it without bothering with its clauses walk away there will be other jobs with people who are willing to let you read it and understand it you have a lot of life ahead of you do not base decisions on a moment of undue pressure budget sensibly and budget for the future modeling is for many models a hard career in terms of regular cash flow there may well be no regular cash flow so you will need to make the money you do earn work harder and last longer have a really good budgeting system in place avoid splurging and always think ahead to the future keep some of your money in an investment account for emergencies try not to touch it unless the need is dire draw up and follow a budget based on your average earnings avoid splurging this can throw out your budget for months to come think about your future consider what you would like to do post modeling many models will not still be modeling beyond their 20s 30s or 40s many reasons are behind this with the most potent probably being the never ending commercial pressure to only feature the youngest faces and looks but realistically many things can cause you to want to leave modeling such as wanting a steady income having children disliking the travel hours dieting pursuing a new passion and so forth by thinking ahead you can safeguard your future as well as

your minimalist wardrobe in the same family warm or cool you ll be able to ensure that every piece matches with almost every other piece and they can freely be switched around to create tons of different outfits get some tops a few standard tops can be mixed and matched to work in any season in any regions you can also mix and match for more or less formal occasions this means just a few pieces will get you through almost any given day get a few basic tees and tanks get tee shirts and tank tops or other warm weather shirts that look good on you you ll want some in neutral colors and some in more interesting colors get some fancy tops you ll then want to get some fancier shirts these are the kinds of shirts that you might wear to a nice bar or to a cocktail party choose these in sensual or dark colors get some basic button downs you ll want several pairs of basic button down shirts depending on the weather in your area these can be long or short sleeve or a mix of the two have most in white but a few can be colored or black get some sweaters now you ll want some sweaters how heavy duty these are and how many you get will depend on the weather in your area have at least one cardigan button down sweater and one full sweater more than one of each is a good idea so that you can have one of each in a neutral color and one of each in a brighter color get some bottoms just like the tops a few standard bottoms can be mixed and matched to work just about anywhere get a few pairs of jeans get several pairs of jeans that fit well at least 3 is a good number more if you wear jeans every day try to err on the side of darker blue jeans with similarly dark seams this are less prone to going out of style and they make just about everyone look thinner at least one of these pairs might need to be shorts if your weather gets warm enough to ever need shorts get a pair of slacks now you ll want a pair or two of slacks the best bet is one pair of black thinly pinstriped if you want to look taller and thinner slacks and one pair of grey or brown slacks depending on your chosen color scheme get a pair of khakis you ll also want one pair of khakis these are useful for weddings and spring or summer events like easter gatherings they re also great for interviews khakis are easy to dress up or down so having one pair will make your life easier get some dresses if you re a guy just get one suit that fits you well girls however will probably want a couple of dresses for certain occasions get a formal dress one formal dress usually a nice cocktail dress in black will be useful for semi formal events with the right jewelry and the right dress it may even be able to pass for more formal situations depending on the particulars get a day dress now get a dress that is more casual but still pretty this one will be used for both nice summer days but also for events like weddings and garden parties get a short dress if you want to you can get one short dress this can be worn over jeans or leggings for a cute look to go to the mall or it can be worn on it s own to go clubbing get some accessories accessories are a great area to let your own personality shine through you can get sunglasses scarves hats purses watches and other items that show who you are don t forget ladies to get some jewelry adding fancy jewelry can help make a more casual outfit look super dressed up use this to your advantage get some shoes you ll want a few pair of shoes to make sure you re ready for any situation you encounter be careful with colored shoes they can be your friend or your enemy you just have to get them to match get two pairs of casual shoes get these in either brown or black white depending on the color palette you chose you can also get them in colors but be aware that they might now match as well get two pairs of formal shoes get one pair in either brown or black depending on the color palette you chose get a second pair in a more interesting color or just get more of the brown black mix and match now you can mix and match these pieces to get tons of different outfits for different situations of course you will have to supplement with clothes for workouts or lounging but these should cover most of your going outside situations for example for a spring semi formal outfit women can wear the day dress fancy shoes cardigan as needed and nice jewelry men can wear nice shoes khakis and a tee shirt or tank with the cardigan on top another example would be a summer casual outfit men can wear jeans and a tank top or tee with casual shoes women can wear the short dress with shorts underneath and casual shoes women can wear slacks the fancy top and the cardigan on top men can wear a button down top and slacks both would wear form shoes and accessories get help dressing semi formal semi formal attire can be confusing since these days it generally means formal basically think of full formal as being ball gowns and your nicest tux with cuff links semi formal then becomes cocktail dresses and suits with colorful button down shirts tie optional get help dressing business casual it s business but it s casual seems like it would be a huge contradiction right it s not as complex as it sounds generally you take one half of your outfit and make it more casual while maintaining business attire on the other for example jeans formal shoes a button down shirt no tie and suit jacket another example would be wearing formal pants and shoes but a more party friendly blouse as long as it s not revealing dress for a party of course dressing for a party is a bit complicated it really depends on what kind of party it is know ahead of time whether it s a costume or not beyond that always err on the side of too formal dressing slightly nicer than what you expect everyone else will be dressed as if you re over dressed just say that you so rarely get an excuse to dress nice you wanted to take the chance learn how to dress for a wedding you can probably guess that it would be in bad form to dress in all black for a wedding unless you re one of the guys putting on a tux but beyond that you re clueless the best advice is to dress semi formal and in pastel happy colors woman should avoid going to bright and should never wear mostly white as this is seen as trying to draw attention away from the bride get help dressing for an interview dressing like a pro for an interview is one of the most important things you can do to land a job but how exactly do you dress like with a party it s a good idea to dress just a little bit nicer than is maybe necessary dress not like how you would expect to dress in that position but rather dress how you would expect to if you were going to have your new boss

a flat surface and fold in both sleeves then grab the collar and fold back so it lines up with the hem of the shirt if you re gifting a pair of pants fold them in half along the crotch so the pant legs line up then fold in half so the waistband lines up with the hem fold in half again measure the width of your wrapping paper and trim unroll a large piece of wrapping paper on a hard flat surface place the folded piece of clothing in the center measure two fingers worth of space on the right and left sides of the clothing item then trim the excess paper using scissors 1 x research source your wrapping paper should be positioned so the printed side faces down cut your wrapping paper to the correct length the bottom flap must be long enough to fold over and cover the entire clothing item the top flap should be long enough to fold halfway across your piece of clothing when you ve determined the correct measurements trim the wrapping paper with a pair of scissors 2 x research source when folded the bottom edge of the wrapping paper should be flush with the top edge of the folded piece of clothing secure the top and bottom flaps with double stick tape fold the top flap over the piece of clothing and smooth it down apply a strip of double stick tape to the inside edge of the bottom flap then fold the bottom flap over the top flap securing the tape by pressing the patterned side of the paper with your fingers 3 x research source if you don t have double stick tape you can use regular tape instead apply the tape after you ve folded the bottom flap over the top flap at this point the top and bottom of the wrapping paper should be sealed the right and left sides remain open fold in the left flap then cut off the corners fold in the extra flap of wrapping paper on the left side then press down with your hand to make a crease using scissors snip off a small right triangle of wrapping paper at each corner of the flap 4 x research source the bottom point of triangle should be positioned along the crease the crease should be aligned with the edge of the clothing item cut along the crease to remove the inside piece of the flap the left flap is made up of two layers of wrapping paper use scissors to cut off the inner layer following the line of the crease 5 x research source apply double sided tape to the the remaining flap and fold to seal cut a piece of double sided tape and stick it to the inner non patterned edge of the remaining layer of the left flap fold in the flap and smooth the patterned side with your hand to seal the left side of the gift 6 x research source it should close like the flap of an envelope repeat the process with the right side begin by folding in the extra paper on the right side and trimming off the corners then cut off the inner layer of the flap apply double sided tape and seal 7 x research source finish off with a ribbon or a bow for a particularly festive look roll your item of clothing tightly this works best for thinner items of clothing that can be rolled tightly such as t shirts thinner scarves and jeans generally you will need to fold the piece of clothing into a long skinny rectangle and begin rolling from one end until you ve run out of fabric 8 x research source for a t shirt lay it upside down and flat on a hard surface fold in both sleeves then start from the hem and roll it up to secure the rolled up clothing consider tying a piece of ribbon or twine around the middle and knotting it this will keep the clothing from unrolling during the wrapping process lay three sheets of tissue paper flat on top of each other select three sheets of tissue paper preferable in three different colors consider picking shades that reflect the occasion reds and greens for christmas for example or orange and black for halloween 9 x research source you should be working on a flat hard surface like a table or countertop make sure your workspace is free of grease or dirt which will stain the tissue paper roll up the clothing item gently inside the tissue paper center the rolled up piece of clothing along the top edge of the tissue paper grasp the top edge of the paper gently with your fingers and roll it up and around the piece of clothing continue rolling until there are a few inches of tissue paper sticking out at the bottom 10 x research source the tissue paper should be positioned vertically so the shorter sides are at the top and bottom fold up the bottom edge of the tissue paper and secure with double sided tape cut a small strip of double sided tape and place it vertically across the top of the fold to secure it one side of the tape will be unattached and facing up then wrap the end piece of tissue paper up and around into the rest of the roll the tape will secure the end piece in place 11 x research source smooth the tissue paper gently with your fingers to seal the tape you should end up with a tube of tissue paper that s open at both ends cinch the ends and tie them with ribbons cut two equally sized pieces of ribbon each about 1 foot 0 30 m long using your fingers cinch the right side of the tissue paper tube where the edge of the clothing item is wrap the ribbon around this spot and knot it 12 x research source repeat with the left side use wire edged ribbon which is easier to shape fold each ribbon in half and cut diagonally for extra flair to add a bit of polish to the ends of your ribbons fold the end of each ribbon in half using scissors cut a straight diagonal line starting from the wire end and slanting down towards the center of the fold then unfold to reveal a v shaped edge 13 x research source repeat with the other three ends to complete the effect fold the piece of clothing neatly you can wrap almost any item of clothing in a gift bag pants t shirts dresses scarves skirts and more if you re gifting a t shirt for example lay it facing down on a flat surface and fold in both sleeves then fold the collar back so it aligns up with the hem of the shirt 14 x research source you could also roll up your clothing item and secure with a piece of ribbon or twine make sure to remove price tags or cover up the price with a marker recipients shouldn t know the price of any gift related item lay 3 or 4 overlapping sheets of tissue paper on a flat surface position each piece of tissue paper so its left edge is 2 inches 5 1 cm 3 inches 7 6 cm to the right from the sheet directly below use more tissue paper for a larger clothing item and less for a smaller one 15 x research source if your piece of clothing is quite small like a tie or thin tank top consider using half size sheets of tissue paper you can alternate colors of tissue paper or use the same color throughout place the gift on top of the tissue paper and gather the paper around it make sure the clothing item is centered on the top sheet of tissue paper grab two opposite corners of the tissue paper and pull them up and over the item hold the corners together with one hand then pull the other two corners in gently cinch the paper together directly above the piece of clothing 16 x research source at this point the tissue paper should be pulled around the clothing like a small drawstring bag place the tissue wrapped clothing into the gift bag pick the clothing item up from the bottom to prevent the fragile tissue paper from ripping the gift bag you ve chosen should be at least 3 times the size of your clothing item 17 x research source you may need to adjust the tissue paper that s now sticking out the top of the bag make sure not to overwork the tissue paper which will make it look old and wrinkly add an extra sheet of tissue paper for more volume lay a sheet of tissue paper flat on a hard surface pinch the middle with your thumb and forefinger then lift and flick your wrist to create an upside down cone shape flip it and place it in the bag adjusting the corners slightly so it fits in with the other layers of tissue paper 18 x research source you can also attach a gift tag with ribbon to one of the handles,Personal-Care-and-Style

also remove the dress from the dryer once it s the desired size and let it finish air drying on a hanger or a drying rack repeat the process if you are shrinking a polyester dress polyester is a synthetic fabric and is much more difficult to shrink than cotton you may have to wash and dry it on high heat 2 or 3 times to see results it s also a very durable fabric so washing and drying it several times shouldn t harm your polyester dress fill a sink with lukewarm water and add several drops of soap use a gentle non alkaline soap and mix it into the water with your hands you can also use a plastic bucket or tub that s big enough to fully submerge the dress 7 x research source if you haven t washed your dress before test to see if it s colorfast using a cotton ball dab a small

clothes you re drying feature zippers or other sharp edges that could damage the silk dry the silk dress for 5 minutes then remove it and check its size it s important that you check the dress periodically to prevent it from over shrinking stop the dryer after 5 minutes and pull out the dress to assess its size 14 x research source since silk is so delicate it may have shrunk enough after just one 5 minute period continue drying in 5 minute intervals until it s shrunk to your liking if you want to shrink the dress further throw it back in the dryer and continue to check its size every 5 minutes when it has reached the ideal proportions remove it completely from the dryer 15 x research source then hang your dress up on a hanger to keep it from getting wrinkled set your washing machine to high heat heat allows the fibers in wool to relax and shorten which will shrink your dress wool dresses shrink very quickly however so you ll need to be more careful with these garments than you would with dresses made of cotton and polyester 16 x research source if your dress has a care label that says dry clean only washing it will shrink it significantly select the shortest available cycle and wash your wool dress for wool the movement of the washing machine contributes more to the shrinking process than the temperature choose the shortest wash cycle to keep your dress from becoming too small in the wash 17 x research source you can toss other clothes in the washing machine during this process just make sure they are similar colors to your wool dress begin drying the dress on low heat since wool is more sensitive than cotton or polyester don t dry it on the highest heat setting select a low heat option on your dryer and toss in your wool dress 18 x research source check the dress regularly for uneven shrinkage pull your dress out of the dryer every 10 to 15 minutes to see if it s shrinking unevenly if you notice that some parts have shrunk more than others stretch out the shrunken pieces a bit with your hands before throwing the dress back in the dryer repeat this process until the dress has reached your desired size dunk the dress in water and re shape it if you ve over shrunk it if you pull you dress out of the dryer during one of the regular checks and it s already too small there s a chance you can reshape it immediately place the dress in cool water for about half an hour 19 x research source then place it flat on a towel and stretch it out to the desired size before allowing it to fully air dry,Personal-Care-and-Style

the touch if they still feel wet keep them on your rack otherwise you can fold and put them away 7 x research source avoid putting laundry away if it s still damp since you could trap moisture which could grow mold or mildew clean out the lint filter if there s anything inside it open the door for your dryer and check for a filter or screen with dryer lint near the front take the filter out and

filter air won t be able to travel as well through your dryer and it may take longer for your clothes to dry sort your laundry into similar colors and fabrics while it can be convenient to do all of your laundry in a single load different heat levels can cause your garments to shrink fade or get damaged check the tags on each of your garments to find out the proper way to dry them organize your laundry into separate piles so you can care for all of your clothes properly 10 x research source if your clothes don t have a tag or you re unsure if they re dryer safe choose to air dry them instead to avoid any damage shake your clothes out before putting them in your dryer grab a piece of your freshly washed laundry and give it 2 3 solid shakes so it doesn t bunch up try to smooth the garment out by hand before setting it in your dryer that way your clothes will have fewer wrinkle and creases when you take them out of the machine 11 x research source if your clothes still feel wet coming out of your washer try twisting them to wring out the excess water you may also try laying the garment flat on a large dry towel and wrapping it tightly for 5 minutes load the dryer so it s only filled halfway tumble dryers need space for air to flow around the clothes so avoid filling your dryer to the top pay attention to how much space your laundry takes up inside your dryer and avoid adding more if it s more than half full if you need to split your larger loads into a few smaller loads so they re more manageable 12 x research source if you fill the dryer too full it won t be able to tumble properly and could leave your clothes wrinkled and damp run the cycle made for the fabrics and colors you re drying look at the cycle options available for your dryer and pick the one that best matches the type of laundry you re doing turn the dial or press the button to select the cycle before starting the machine let the full cycle run without opening the door so heat doesn t escape the machine 13 x research source for example if you re washing thin fabrics or lingerie try using the delicates cycle some dryers have moisture sensors that automatically stop the dryer when it doesn t detect any more water look up your dryer model to see if it has this feature if you re only drying a few items and need them quickly try putting a dry towel in the dryer with your clothes to help absorb some moisture take the towel out after 15 minutes and run the items for another 5 10 minutes until they re dry fold or hang your clothes immediately after taking them out take your clothes out of the dryer as soon as the cycle finishes so they aren t sitting in a pile shake each garment as you take it out of the dryer so it doesn t bunch up or wrinkle fold your clothes as soon as you can so they don t develop any other creases 14 x research source set a laundry basket near your dryer so you can set your folded laundry inside and transport it easier,Personal-Care-and-Style

it away yet most holes can easily be hidden such as by ironing on a simple fabric patch if you re looking for a more permanent way to fill in or even decorate a hole sew it shut with colored thread sometimes you can t fix a hole right away so get creative and find ways to hide it underneath clothing or other items with the right fix you can still look your best without having to bring along a change of clothes,tuck your shirt in if the hole is near them hem tuck the hem into your pants to cover a hole near the bottom part of the shirt if the hole near the collar or sleeves you still might be able to hide it in a natural way for instance if it s near the collar fold the collar down to cover it for holes on shirt sleeves roll the sleeves up if the hole can t easily be hidden this way stay aware of it for example you may be able to hide a hole in the armpit just by keeping your arm down until you get home wear a matching color underneath the shirt to make a hole less visible try putting on something light such as a thin t shirt underneath the damaged shirt make sure it is long enough to cover the hole if both shirts match in color people won t be able to see the hole unless they look closely pants or other articles of clothing can also be used to mask some holes this way wear a jacket over your shirt for holes that are difficult to hide put on a jacket to cover a hole anywhere on a shirt unless the hole is in the front you won t even have to zip up sweatshirts and button ups are also good options if you don t have anything to wear purchase an additional layer if you have the time layering clothing is easier during cold or stormy weather people will notice if you re wearing an extra layer during a heatwave and you will end up sweating so much that you would rather leave the hole exposed cover holes with matching colored tape if you have any pick tape that blends in well with your shirt try using a piece of masking tape cut to the size of the hole for instance set it on top of the hole and press it flat if it matches your shirt well enough the tape can prevent people from noticing the hole 1 x research source tape tends to work best on darker colors such as black it blends in better with the shirt tape is best used on less exposed areas such as around the shirt s hem if the tape is in a very visible spot people will be more likely to notice it cover the hole with an accessory if you have one that fits when you re in a pinch reach for any sort of decoration you can fit over the hole for example get a big button a badge or a brooch and pin it to your shirt you could use a plastic flower or something equally colorful tuck the stem in then pin the flower in place 2 x research source some decorations may draw attention to your shirt if the hole is well covered decorations can make your shirt look more stylish instead of damaged pins are also very useful for attaching fabric to holes you could create a makeshift patch to use until you re able to install a real one when you re in a pinch you may not have many options find what you can consider carrying a spare clip or safety pin for emergencies cut a patch of fabric 1 2 in 1 3 cm bigger than the hole choose a piece of fabric that matches the color of your shirt try matching the texture and weight of the material as well you can buy fabric patches or cut a patch from another piece of clothing 3 x research source if you re trying to patch a multicolored shirt use a color that blends in well for example choose a fabric color that matches the print on the shirt you can buy iron on shirt patches online and at many fabric stores trim a piece of fusible web bonding to the same size as the patch place the patch on top of the fusible bonding to gauge how to cut it trace around it with pencil then trim it to size with fabric scissors the fusible bonding will be the adhesive that binds the patch to the shirt in general the fusible bonding should be the same size or a little smaller than the patch so it doesn t bleed through the hole 4 x research source you can get fusible bonding online or at fabric stores it comes in a sheet similar to regular fabric turn the shirt inside out and place the fusible bonding over the hole center the fusible bonding over the hole make sure the hole is completely covered the fusible bonding should overlap the hole by at least 1 4 in 0 64 cm on all sides if it looks a little small cut a bigger piece 5 x research source if you re having a hard time getting the fusible bonding to lay flat iron the shirt also trim away any loose thread around the hole place the fabric patch on top of the fusible bonding line up the edges of the patch with the fusible bonding beneath it if they are slightly different sizes double check that the patch completely covers the fusible bonding if it doesn t cut a bigger patch or trim the fusible bonding a little smaller while still ensuring it covers the hole in your shirt 6 x research source the fusible bonding is the glue between the pieces of fabric it can cause the shirt to stick to your ironing board if you re fixing a hole less than 1 in 2 5 cm in size you could heat the fusible bonding without the patch then press the shirt s threads together to cover the hole it s possible to fix the hole without making a patch although the repair won t be as sturdy as usual warm the patch with an iron on a low heat wool setting for 10 seconds turn the iron to the wool setting and let it heat up for about 2 minutes once it is warm place it on top of the patch hold it still so the patch can t shift out of place then turn the iron off set it in a space spot to cool down and check the patch 7 x research source if your iron doesn t have a wool setting mist the patch with lukewarm water to soften it and press out wrinkles consult the manufacturer s instructions for specifics about how to heat the fusible bonding it can vary a little depending on which product you buy select a type of thread that matches your shirt s color and texture while you can use other colors if you wish get thread that matches your shirt color so the stitching blends in as much as possible for texture cotton thread works well in most cases if you re trying to fix a thinner material like chiffon or satin use nylon or silk thread instead 8 x research source purchase thread online or from a fabric store while you re there make sure you have a needle and other sewing supplies if you re trying to cover a hole more than 1 in 2 5 cm in size you could sew a patch onto the shirt another option is to darn the shirt by sewing across the hole thread a needle with at least 18 in 46 cm of thread unroll the thread from its spool then cut it off with a sharp pair of scissors take the end of the thread and slip it into the needle slide the needle until it s about halfway along the thread then knot the thread right behind the needle 9 x research source if you re having trouble threading the needle dampen the end of the thread a little bit you could also get a needle threader to pull the thread through the needle s eye poke the needle up through the fabric near the hole start on the top right side of the hole position your needle inside the shirt then pull it up through the fabric keep pulling it until it s about 2 in 5 1 cm above the shirt make sure the needle is about 1 2 in 1 3 cm away from the hole so the stitches don t fall apart 10 x research source if you re having a hard time positioning the needle turn the shirt inside out try lifting up one of the shirt s threads and moving the needle underneath it to start the stitch move the needle through the fabric on the opposite side of the opening bring the needle down through the hole without touching the fabric first while it s inside the shirt position it pull it up through the shirt again to finish the stitch doing this will pull the fabric closer together covering part of the hole 11 x research source the positioning of the needle determines how big the stitches are smaller stitches are stronger so don t try to bridge the entire hole unless it s very small stitch on opposite sides of the hole until it is completely closed follow the same steps to make subsequent stitches from inside the shirt position the needle to the left of where it initially passed through the shirt after pulling it through position the needle to the left of where you had it the second time to complete the initial stitch continue making as many stitches as needed to complete the repair 12 x research source take your time and keep your stitches as even possible remember to keep them at the right distance from the hole so they are strong but well hidden if you re darning a large hole sew across the entire hole in one direction afterward sew perpendicularly to the threads to create a woven net filling the gap in the fabric pull the needle inside of the shirt to knot the thread wrap the remaining thread around the needle about 3 times to create loops pull the needle through these loops to create knots make about 2 or 3 knots when you re done pull the knots toward the shirt so they won t be visible 13 x research source test the knots afterward by pulling on the thread if it seems loose tie it again make sure the knots are secure so the hole doesn t return cut the excess length of string to finish the repair pull the ends of the thread toward an opening on the shirt reach in and snip the thread underneath the knot remember that the thread has 2 tails so cut both of them off before wearing the shirt again 14 x research source if you re feeling creative you could embroider a design on the shirt using different thread colors it s a clever way to mask stitching by making it part of a colorful design use a fabric repair glue if you are unable to stitch the hole shut lay the shirt facedown and trim away any loose threads around the hole squeeze a small amount of glue onto a separate surface such as a piece of scrap paper then use something small like a plastic knife or toothpick to spread the glue around the hole squeeze the fabric together afterward for about 2 minutes until it sticks in place 15 x research source wait at least 24 hours before wearing or washing the shirt give the glue plenty of time to dry out note that glue only works for small holes and tears it also won t be as permanent as stitching but can be less visible,Personal-Care-and-Style

bleach with 1 gallon 3 8 l of warm water in a large bucket submerge the stained garment in the solution and let it sit for about 5 minutes so the bleach can work on the stains then rinse the item with cool water and wring it out gently 3 x research source after doing the soak you can either hang the item up to air dry or proceed with washing the item with the rest of the load load whites loosely in

bleach break it up into 2 smaller loads for the best results 4 x research source set the washing cycle to normal to safely bleach most fabrics typically you don t need to bleach your whites using a special wash cycle you can set the machine to the normal cycle you may want to use the delicate cycle if you re bleaching delicate fabrics or prized items 5 x research source set the machine to the

temperature recommended on the care tag for the best results a normal cycle is fine for most items but set the machine to delicate for fragile fabrics 14 x research source if there s no recommendation
