how to make your girlfriend want to have sex with you,you have reached that point in your relationship where you want to take it to the next level some people think that sex is no big deal but others see it as something they only want to share with an extra special person although you never want to force your girlfriend to have sex with you you can always soothe some of her fears and reassure her that you really are a person she can fully trust after you do this sex comes naturally,be dependable if you want to make your girlfriend want to have sex with you then you should show her what an amazingly dependable guy you are if your girl is going to trust you enough to have sex with you whether it s her first time or if she s had sex before then she has to feel like she can depend on you one of her fears may be that as soon as you have sex she won t be able to rely on you anymore because you would have gotten what you wanted so prove her wrong by being an upstanding and dependable guy show up when you say you re going to show up if you routinely pick her up half an hour late for your dates she ll think that you don t think she s so special and she ll be less likely to have sex with you don t be a flake if you say you re going to take her to the beach over the weekend do it if you don t stick to your word she won t be able to trust you be her rock let her talk to you about her problems and insecurities while knowing that you can make her feel better don t go hours or even a day or two without returning her phone calls or texts this will make her feel like she can t depend on you give it time some guys can be ready to have sex with a girl in the time it takes to down a beer while some girls can take months or even longer to decide that they re ready to make love and some girls sorry gentlemen are really adamant about holding out for the one and don t even want to have sex before marriage so don t rush into it wait for the girl to trust you first if your girl is barely comfortable with kissing then you shouldn t bring up the s word for a while however if you and your girlfriend are already comfortable hooking up in bed all the time after just a few weeks then you can start thinking about taking it to the next level if you want to make your girlfriend want to have sex with you the worst thing you can do is bring it up or try to force it when it s way too early this will turn your girlfriend off and will make her much less likely to sleep with you do not act like you are obsessed with sex let s face it if you re a male of a certain age who is desperate for his girlfriend to have sex with him then you probably are obsessed with sex but that doesn t mean you have to make jokes innuendos or even blatant references to sex all the time the last thing you want your girlfriend to think is that you re a horndog who is so obsessed with sex that you don t care which lady comes into your bed you should make her feel special like you want only her you don t have to hide the fact that you re a man with needs but you should avoid being vulgar talking about sex all the time or talking about other people who have sex all the time don t make derogatory comments about other women this will make your girlfriend feel like a piece of meat remember that you re not with your bros but with your special lady be loyal if you want to make your girlfriend trust you then you have to be loyal to her she ll never have sex with you if she thinks you re talking to or checking out other women or even hanging out with other women though you don t have to be rude to or ignore other women you should have a laser sharp focus on your girlfriend so she knows that you will always be there for her especially after you start having sex spend lots of time with her make sure that you plan at least one or two dates every week and that you check in with her at least once a day if you re not together there s a difference between being loyal and being possessive and smothering your girlfriend with affection you should make a point of seeing her when you both want to hang out but don t try to see her 24 7 or she ll begin to pull back you should not only show your girl that you re loyal by being loyal to her but by showing that you re a loyal sibling friend and teammate show loyalty in many aspects of your life and your girl will be impressed treat her like a lady if you want your girlfriend to have sex with you then you should treat her like a lady not just like someone you want to hook up with to do this you have to be a gentleman and be courteous kind understanding and generally admirable open doors for her give her your coat when she s cold pull out chairs for her and help her carry her heavy bags make sure to compliment her to let her know how great she looks or how special she is it s important to be a gentleman but don t do anything that feels too unnatural to you or she ll be able to tell that you re not being yourself clean your home this may sound silly but if you want your girlfriend to really feel special then you shouldn t invite her to hang out at your place if it looks like the set for world war z you need to make sure to remove any dirty laundry off your floor clean your counters and make your bed look and smell as clean and inviting as possible not only will this make your lady feel special but it ll make her feel more inclined to have sex with you she won t want to get it on if your bed is covered in candy wrappers and dirty underwear if you drive her around a lot you should also keep a clean car give your lady the respect she deserves by making sure she has a clean seat show an interest in all of her not just her body your girl s biggest fear may be that you don t care at all about her mind because you re too busy obsessing over her body so you have to prove her wrong show her that you are about who she is as a person about her hopes and dreams and about what makes her tick ask her about her friendships her childhood and her favorite experiences show her that you value her opinion ask her what she thinks about the current political situation in your state or about the look of your new outfit make eye contact when you talk to her show her that everything she says is important to you take her out on romantic dates if you want to build the sexual tension you have to build the romance first make her feel special by taking her out dressing up and picking a romantic spot for dinner a drink or even just for stargazing you don t have to do anything corny or out of your element to make her feel special though you and your lady can have fun at baseball games birthday parties or at a loud sweaty concert these events will be less conducive to lovemaking doing something romantic once in a while will show your lady that she really matters to you be attentive to her needs if you re not attentive to your lady s everyday needs then how will you be attentive in the bedroom your girl needs to feel like you know when she s sad nervous anxious or even just cold or hungry pay attention to her eyes her body language and her words to know if there s something bothering her if you act completely oblivious when she s obviously upset about something then she ll think you re not really paying attention to her if something s wrong don t be afraid to ask her what s up this will only show that you care make sure she s ready to have sex if you really want to treat your lady well then you have to be able to have an idea about whether or not she s ready for sex if you re her first boyfriend if she s sexually inexperienced or if she s deeply religious or has other moral convictions that make her steadfast about not having sex then you should back off and wait for her to trust you enough to even consider having sex with you but here are some ways to know if she does want to have sex with you if things have been getting hot and heavy in the hook up department then she may be ready to move forward if she s been talking about sex giving you sexual compliments and touching you a lot more then she may be ready for sex if she s been hinting that she wants to sleep over spends a lot of time in or near your bed or invites you over late at night then she may be ready for more intimacy if she has deep moral or religious convictions that make her not want to have sex don t try to force it accept that some girls will never have sex until they re married and that there s nothing you can do to change their mind be prepared if you plan on trying to have sex or even talking about having sex with your girl then you should be prepared with some condoms in case the mood strikes her this doesn t mean that you should flash the condoms or make her feel uncomfortable but it does mean that you should have some backup just in case things do go in a favorable direction if she wants to have sex and you have to run out to the drugstore for some condoms this may make your first sexual experience fall flat set the mood if you want your girl to have sex with you then you have to set the mood you should start the evening by doing something romantic to soften her up then go back to your clean apartment which should be stocked with red wine grapes chocolate and some light jazz on the radio light the candles and turn the radio on to get her in a romantic mindset and offer her something to eat or drink if this feels corny you should only do what makes you both get in the mood if you just want to dim the lights instead of lighting candles then that s fine too kiss her if you want your girl to have sex with you then you have to be a master kisser even if you ve been kissing for a while you should still know how to kiss her in a variety of ways and make your kisses feel fresh don t overwhelm her and grope her the second you lock lips instead take it slow grazing your lips as you touch her hair or stroke her face take breaks from kissing so she has time to come up for air and want you even more you are not very likely to have sex with your girlfriend if all you ve done is kiss it takes a bit longer for things to reach a natural progression play hard to get if you really want to make your girlfriend want you then you shouldn t act like a sexual beast moving rapidly from kissing to touching to ripping off your clothes and practically levitating into the bedroom instead you should kiss your girlfriend for a few seconds then hold back stroke her and talk to her repeat this move a few times and wait for her to go wild 1 x research source why does playing hard to get work because this will make your girlfriend feel like you like her but that you re in control of your desires and aren t desperate to get your hands all over her even if you are this move will make her want to be the one who asks for more touch her if you want to turn on your girlfriend you can start thinking about doing more than just kissing begin by lightly caressing her arms the back of her head and hair and then as things progress stroke her breasts under her shirt or wait for her to touch you if your clothes are off or partly off you can kiss her breasts or touch her in more sensual ways just make sure that your actions are reciprocated if you re touching her and she just lies there and doesn t make noise or do anything then you re probably making her uncomfortable make sure she s ready for more before you proceed if you re already in the bedroom and hooking up then you can simply ask her if she s ready to have sex with you this doesn t have to be elaborate or corny just say are you sure you re ready and be prepared for any answer don t ever pressure her if your girlfriend says she s not ready to have sex with you then you shouldn t pressure her don t try making any arguments saying things like but we ve been together for so long everyone else is doing it or but i really really like you isn t going to make her feel any better in fact trying to reason with her will only make her more frustrated annoyed and much less likely to sleep with you respect her wishes if she changes her mind from yes to no or asks you to stop during the act do so immediately it may be useful to have a chat beforehand about what she wants to do and what she isn t ready for pay attention and never make her do something that she isn t comfortable with be a good judge learn to translate her reactions don t insist when she is against there is always a tomorrow to make another try it advisable to try a turn on when her mood is good feelings cannot be feigned since they are a function of the mind good timing and taking matters easy will ultimately make her mellow down no matter how long the process may take just know she will come around when she thinks the time is right,Relationships

how to stop criticizing others,criticism is toxic to healthy relationships while it s okay to express frustration if someone is behaving in a way that hurts you being overly critical can cause tension in any relationship over time 1 x research source first work on changing your own behavior to catch criticism before it begins from there find effective ways to communicate if someone bothers you lastly work on educating yourself and challenging any assumptions you have that make you an overly critical person,think before you speak before you dish out criticism pause and consider whether you really need to say anything at all if someone did something to get on your nerves do you really need to point it out sometimes it s best to let small indiscretions go try taking a few deep breaths and leaving the room instead of criticizing 2 x research source it s best not to criticize someone s personality people have very little control over personality quirks if your friend jane has a tendency to get caught up in her own interests it might be best to just smile and nod while she s going on and on about a new tv show she loves if this is just something she does criticizing it will probably not result in the behavior changing 3 x research source avoid criticism that goes for someone s personality over his or her actions for example it may be a problem that your boyfriend forgets to pay his phone bill on time each month however saying something like why are you so forgetful isn t terribly productive it may be best to be quiet for now and later when you re calm talk about finding productive ways to better manage bill payment such as downloading a phone app that will provide a reminder when it is time to pay the phone bill every month 4 x research source be realistic critical people often have very high expectations of those around them it s possible your tendency to criticize stems from expecting too much from those around you if you find yourself consistently annoyed or disappointed with others it may be a good idea to adjust your expectations 5 x research source think about the last time you criticized someone what lead to this criticism were your expectations in the situation realistic for example say you criticized your girlfriend for not answering your texts quickly enough when she was out with friends you told her this made you feel uncared for and that she should have answered right away pause and examine these expectations can you really expect your girlfriend to be on her phone when she s socializing isn t your girlfriend entitled to a social life outside of your relationship you have probably occasionally missed texts or returned them late if you were busy in this case maybe you could adjust your expectations it may not be reasonable to expect a text returned immediately if you know your girlfriend is hanging out with other people depersonalize other people s actions oftentimes critical people have a tendency to personalize events that occur around them this can bleed out into personalizing the actions of others if someone gets on your nerves or makes your life difficult you may feel the urge to criticize that person however remember other people have their own separate lives and struggles if someone did something to bother you the majority of the time their actions were not directed at you for example say you have a friend who routinely cancels plans you may take this as an act of disrespect and feel compelled to criticize that person for not valuing your relationship however realistically your friend s actions are probably not personal look at the situation from an outside perspective is your friend very busy is she just generally a flaky person is your friend more introverted than others a variety of factors may make a person cancel plans often chances are it isn t about you personally criticizing may add more stress to someone whose life is already stressful separate the individual from their actions critical people are often guilty of filtering this means you only focus on the negative aspects of a situation or a person failing to see good qualities alongside negative ones 6 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source this may lead to your criticizing others if you find yourself making assumptions about a person s character stop yourself try to separate a frustrating action from the person doing the action we all behave poorly sometimes but a single action is not a reflection of character if you see someone cut in line do you immediately think that person is rude if so stop for a moment and reconsider maybe that person is in a hurry maybe he has a lot on his mind and he did not realize he cut you can be frustrated by the action getting cut in line is annoying however try not to judge a stranger s character based on the action 7 x research source if you work on separating the person from the action you may naturally want to criticize less as you come to realize you cannot judge a person s character based on a single choice or decision you will be unable to call someone out for being rude or disrespectful focus on positives oftentimes being critical results from how you re choosing to see a situation everyone has flaws and imperfections however the vast majority of people have good qualities that outweigh these flaws try to focus on a person s positive qualities over their negative ones having a positive attitude can change the way you react to stress negative emotions activate the amygdala which is a major trigger of feelings of stress an anxiety if you re feeling keyed up yourself this can lead to negative interactions with others working on developing a positive attitude can help you stop criticizing others 8 x research source believe everyone has some natural goodness in them while you may be skeptical of this fact try giving everyone the benefit of the doubt in this regard go out of the way to look for people doing good in the world focus on the person in the supermarket who told the cashier to have a nice day pay attention to the coworker who always smiles at you on your way to your desk 9 x research source oftentimes people s flaws actually stem from other positive qualities for example your boyfriend may take a long time to complete basic household tasks this could be because he s more conscientious than others maybe he spends an extra 20 minutes doing the dishes because he makes the effort to get them extra clean give feedback rather than criticism as stated some people have issues that may need addressing a friend who s chronically late on bill payments could use some guidance a co worker who s consistently late for meetings may need to work on time management however feedback is very different from criticism when addressing an issue focus on suggestions you can make to help another person improve this is more effective than simply criticizing people tend to respond better to productive statements offering them feedback and encouragement over flat out criticism 10 x research source let s return to an earlier example your boyfriend always forgets to pay his phone bill on time each month this leads to unnecessary stress and is starting to affect his credit rating you may be inclined to say something like why can t you pay more attention to bills or why don t you just remember when it s due this may not be helpful your boyfriend already knows he needs to be more conscientious but for whatever reason is struggling to do so instead provide feedback rooted in praise that works towards a solution say something like i love that you re trying to be more responsible why don t we get you a big calendar from the staples downtown when you phone bill comes you can write down when it s due you can also offer to help in any way you can for example i can remind you to write down when the bill s due each month ask for what you want directly inefficient communication often results in heavy criticism if you re not telling someone what you want that person cannot be expected to know make sure to ask for what you want in a direct respectful manner this will eliminate the need for criticism down the road 11 x research source say your boyfriend always forgets to wash utensils after using them instead of letting your anger over this pile up which could result in your criticizing later address the problem right away 12 x research source be respectful when addressing the problem do not say stop putting dirty forks in the sink it drives me crazy just wash them instead try something like can you please work on washing your forks after you use them i notice our utensils pile up a lot 13 x research source use i statements difficult situations do arise in any relationship if someone hurt your feelings or upset you this needs to be addressed instead of criticizing express the problem using i statements i statements are sentences structured in a way to emphasize your personal feelings over external judgement or blame an i statement has three parts it begins with i feel after which you immediately state your feeling then you explain the actions that lead to that feeling finally you explain why you feel the way you do for example say you re upset because your boyfriend has been spending the majority of his weekends with his friends do not say it s very hurtful that you spend all your time with your friends and don t invite me i m left out all the time rephrase the above sentiment using an i statement say something like i feel left out when you go out with your friends and don t invite me because i feel like you don t spend any downtime with me consider the other party s perspective judgment and criticism go hand in hand if you criticize others too often you may be shutting out the other person s point of view try to step in another s person s shoes before criticizing genuinely try to see things from that person s perspective think about the criticism you re about to say how would you feel to be on the receiving end of that criticism even if what you re saying has some truth are you phrasing it in a way that will go over well for example if your boyfriend is consistently late you may be inclined to say you re being incredibly disrespectful to me by always showing up late chances are your boyfriend is not trying to disrespect you and he may feel attacked by criticism phrased in this way how would you feel to have someone lash out at you like this 14 x research source also try to consider outside factors that affect behavior say your best friend has been less social lately she may not be returning your texts quickly or at all is there anything going on in her life that affects her behavior for example maybe you know she s stressed at work or school maybe she just went through a difficult breakup this could be affecting her ability or her desire to socialize try to understand this and not jump to judgment look for a mutually beneficial solution to problems finally a good way to cut back on criticism is to look for a solution to issues you re having with others criticism should ideally be working towards an effective solution to a negative situation simply being critical in and of itself is not helpful 15 x research source tell someone what you want him or her to change let s return to the boyfriend example maybe you want your boyfriend to keep better track of time tell him ways he can get ready to go faster let him know what timeframes you re comfortable with for example maybe you strongly prefer to arrive at events slightly early let him know this so he makes an effort to be ready to go a little earlier you should also be willing to compromise for example getting to a party 30 minutes before it starts may be a bit much maybe you can agree to arrive 10 to 15 minutes early from now on instead challenge your assumptions about others we make assumptions about other people all the time making too many assumptions too frequently can result in being overly critical as you go through your day challenge yourself when you find yourself being critical maybe you assume someone who dresses well or wears a lot of make up is materialistic that person could actually be insecure dressing in a certain way might make that person feel better maybe you see someone who didn t graduate high school as lazy or unmotivated however that person could have had extenuating circumstances at home that disrupted his or her studies 16 x research source remember everyone makes mistakes when you see someone slipping up remember a time when you did not behave or act your best for example if you re judging someone for cutting you off in an intersection remind yourself of your own past driving mistakes 17 x research source work on yourself is there an issue in your own life that you re taking out on those around you if you re unhappy with your job relationship social life or other aspects of yourself try to address these issues the stress of a negative attitude can affect your overall health and well being leading you to unable to handle stress 18 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source this can lead to poor social interactions if you take steps to be a more positive person you may be better at interacting with others you ll be able to cope with conflict in a more effective manner educate yourself many people have hidden disabilities before you judge or criticize a person stop and consider the possibility that person is dealing with an issue you cannot see easily the co worker who seems rude because she does not make small talk may have social anxiety issues your friend who constantly talks about cats may be on the autism spectrum the student in your algebra class who continually asks the same questions may have a learning disability spend some time browsing informational websites that discuss hidden disabilities before you make an assumption about someone s character remind yourself many people struggle with ailments others cannot see 19 x research source seek therapy if necessary if you find your criticism stems from your own unhappiness therapy may be necessary conditions like depression for example can cause you to have angry outbursts directed at others 20 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source therapy can help you better manage your emotions and be less

for his girlfriend to have sex with him then you probably are obsessed with sex but that doesn t mean you have to make jokes innuendos or even blatant references to sex all the time the last thing you want your girlfriend to think is that you re a horndog who is so obsessed with sex that you don t care which lady comes into your bed you should make her feel special like you want only her you don t

trust you then you have to be loyal to her she ll never have sex with you if she thinks you re talking to or checking out other women or even hanging out with other women though you don t have to be rude to or ignore other women you should have a laser sharp focus on your girlfriend so she knows that you will always be there for her especially after you start having sex spend lots of time with her make sure that you plan at least one or two dates every week and that you check in with her at least once a day if you re not together there s a difference between being loyal and being possessive and smothering your girlfriend with affection you should make a point of seeing her when you both want to hang out but don t try to see her 24 7 or she ll begin to pull back you should not only show your girl that you re loyal by being loyal to her but by showing that you re a loyal sibling friend and teammate show loyalty in many aspects of your life and your girl will be impressed treat her like a lady if you want your girlfriend to have sex with you then you should treat her like a lady not just like someone you want to hook up with to do this you have to be a gentleman and be courteous kind understanding and generally admirable open doors for her give her your coat when she s cold pull out chairs for her and help her carry her heavy bags make sure to compliment her to let her know how great she looks or how special she is it s important to be a gentleman but don t do anything that feels too unnatural to you or she ll be able to tell that you re not being yourself clean your home this may sound silly but if you want your girlfriend to really feel special then you shouldn t invite her to hang out at your place if it looks like the set for world war z you need to make sure to remove any dirty laundry off your floor clean your counters and make your bed look and smell as clean and inviting as possible not only will this make your lady feel special but it ll make her feel more inclined to have sex with you she won t want to get it on if your bed is covered in candy wrappers and dirty underwear if you drive her around a lot you should also keep a clean car give your lady the respect she deserves by making sure she has a clean seat show an interest in all of her not just her body your girl s biggest fear may be that you don t care at all about her mind because you re too busy obsessing over her body so you have to prove her wrong show her that you are about who she is as a person about her hopes and dreams and about what makes her tick ask her about her friendships her childhood and her favorite experiences show her that you value her opinion ask her what she thinks about the current political situation in your state or about the look of your new outfit make eye contact when you talk to her show her that everything she says is important to you take her out on romantic dates if you want to build the sexual tension you have to build the romance

her feel special though you and your lady can have fun at baseball games birthday parties or at a loud sweaty concert these events will be less conducive to lovemaking doing something romantic once in a while will show your lady that she really matters to you be attentive to her needs if you re not attentive to your lady s everyday needs then how will you be attentive in the bedroom your girl needs to feel like you know when she s sad nervous anxious or even just cold or hungry pay attention to her eyes her body language and her words to know if there s something bothering her if you act completely oblivious when she s obviously upset about something then she ll think you re not really paying attention to her if something s wrong don t be afraid to ask her what s up this will only show that you care make sure she s ready to have sex if you really want to treat your lady well then you have to be able to have an idea about whether or not she s ready for sex if you re her first boyfriend if she s sexually inexperienced or if she s deeply religious or has other moral convictions that make her steadfast about not having sex then you should back off and wait for her to trust you enough to even consider having sex with you but here are some ways to know if she does want to have sex with you if things have been getting hot and heavy in the hook up department then she may be ready to move forward if she s been talking about sex giving you sexual compliments and touching you a lot more then she may be ready for sex if she s been hinting that she wants to sleep over spends a lot of time in or near your bed or invites you over late at night then she may be ready for more intimacy if she has deep moral or religious convictions that make her not want to have sex don t try to force it accept that some girls will never have sex until they re married and that there s nothing you can do to change their mind be prepared if you plan on trying to have sex or even talking about having sex with your girl then you should be prepared with some condoms in case the mood strikes her this doesn t mean that you should flash the condoms or make her feel uncomfortable but it does mean that you should have some backup just in case things do go in a favorable direction if she wants to have sex and you have to run out to the drugstore for some condoms this may make your first sexual experience fall flat set the mood if you want your girl to have sex with you then you have to set the mood you should start the evening by doing something romantic to soften her up then go back to your clean apartment which should be stocked with red wine grapes chocolate and some light jazz on the radio light the candles and turn the radio on to get her in a romantic mindset and offer her something to eat or drink if this feels corny you should only do what makes you both get in the mood if you just want to dim the lights instead of lighting candles then that s fine too kiss her if you want your girl to have sex with you then you have to be a master kisser even if you ve been kissing for a while you should still know how to kiss her in a variety of ways and make your kisses feel fresh don t overwhelm her and grope her the second you lock lips instead take it slow grazing your lips as you touch her hair or stroke her face take breaks from kissing so she has time to come up for air and want you even more you are not very likely to have sex with your girlfriend if all you ve done is kiss it takes a bit longer for things to reach a natural progression play hard to get if you really want to make your girlfriend want you then you shouldn t act like a sexual beast moving rapidly from kissing to touching to ripping off your clothes and practically levitating into the bedroom instead you should kiss your girlfriend for a few seconds then hold back stroke her and talk to her repeat this move a few times and wait for her to go wild 1 x research source why does playing hard to get work because this will make your girlfriend feel like you like her but that you re in control of your desires and aren t desperate to get your hands all over her even if you are

arms the back of her head and hair and then as things progress stroke her breasts under her shirt or wait for her to touch you if your clothes are off or partly off you can kiss her breasts or touch her in more sensual ways just make sure that your actions are reciprocated if you re touching her and she just lies there and doesn t make noise or do anything then you re probably making her uncomfortable make sure she s ready for more before you proceed if you re already in the bedroom and hooking up then you can simply ask her if she s ready to have sex with you this doesn t have to be elaborate or corny just say are you sure you re ready and be prepared for any answer don t ever pressure her if your girlfriend says she s not ready to have sex with you then you shouldn t pressure her don t try making any arguments saying things like but we ve been together for so long everyone else is doing it or but i really really like you isn t going to make her feel any better in fact trying to reason with her will only make her more frustrated annoyed and much less likely to sleep with you respect her wishes if she changes her mind from yes to no or asks you to stop during the act do so immediately it may be useful to have a chat beforehand about what she wants to do and what she isn t ready for pay attention and never make her do something that she isn t comfortable with be a good judge learn to translate her reactions don t insist when she is against there is always a tomorrow to make another try it advisable to try a turn on when her mood is good feelings cannot be feigned since they are a function of the mind good timing and taking matters easy will ultimately make her mellow down no matter how long the process may take just know she will come around when she thinks the time is right,Relationships

like to have a serous discussion 9 x research source for example you could send a text that says something like hey there s something that s been on my mind i would really like to talk to you as soon

research source if you feel comfortable mentioning the other person say something like as you know i ve also been dating ryan while i value the time you and i have spent together i think ryan is a more compatible match for me longterm i would like to start seeing him exclusively for many reasons you may rather leave the other person out instead of explicitly mentioning you ve chosen someone else mention the factors that contributed to your choice for example i just feel like longterm we don t have the same goals and values i think we would both be better off with someone who s on the same path move forward with the other person once you ve broken up with the other party move forward work on establishing a new relationship with someone you love you may have some lingering feelings

back on your relationships are you able to be fulfilled by a single person or do you frequently find yourself craving love and sex outside of your relationship if it s the latter you may be polyamorous if you feel capable of being in love with and committed to two people at once you may be polyamorous there is some stigma against polyamory but work to shut that out remember when it comes to relationships one size does not fit all if you are polyamorous you should feel comfortable exploring your feelings on the subject without feeling guilt set clear boundaries boundaries are always important in a relationship and especially so if you re in love with two people make sure all parties involved know the rules for the given situation and that everyone is comfortable with the game plan 13 x research source if you re looking into an open or semi open relationship make sure everyone knows what is and is not okay are you allowed to be physically intimate with both parties can your partners pursue relationships outside of their romance with you should one party be prioritized over the other these are questions you need to ask when proceeding with an open relationship if your current partner does not want a completely open relationship he or she may want you to taper off contact with the other person if this is the case make sure you know the kind of contact you re allowed to have and what sorts of contact violate your partner s trust ease into any new rules in a relationship slowly if you want to have an open relationship with someone you should ease into the new routine transitioning from monogamy to polyamory can be difficult there s no reason to rush the transition 14 x research source if your partner is comfortable with you pursuing outside relationships consider whether you should do so right away there is no reason to rush polyamory you may want to give both you and your partner time to adjust to the idea of an open relationship before either of you act on it expect some tension polyamorous or open relationships can be healthy and loving this does not mean that in the beginning things will not feel somewhat messy keep things open in regards to communication be willing to compromise and smooth over any differences that arise keep communication open as you move on however you decide to proceed you and your partner should keep communication open talk to your partner regularly about your feelings if you re seeing two people at once let both parties know if your feelings regarding them change at any point in the future if being in love with two people is causing a lot of tension in a relationship you can talk to a couples counselor a qualified counselor can help you and your partner figure out better ways to communicate,Relationships

time then she ll value it more of course if she seems upset and really wants to talk as soon as possible then you should be there for her instead of acting aloof but if she s calling or texting just to check in then you shouldn t feel compelled to get back to her immediately continue pursuing your own interests don t give up all of the things you love just to be with the girl if you want her to

her but you shouldn t tell her everything you think about her or you ll be putting yourself in a vulnerable position you should keep her guessing about your plans too if you have to leave early to catch your brother s basketball game you don t always have to tell her where you re going check in with her a bit when you re apart if you want the girl to miss you when you re not together then you have to remind her of your presence from time to time send her a text to say hi or to see how her day is going or give her a quick call to tell her about what you ve been up to you can also send her an email from work or shoot her a quick text when you re away with your friend for the weekend make sure you talk to her just enough that she doesn t forget about you but that she also doesn t feel smothered by you either if you re apart make sure you re not always the one getting in touch first you can call or text her from time to time but you shouldn t make her take you for granted and feel like you ll always call even if she doesn t if you know she has something important coming up such as a job interview or a volleyball game then check in with her to wish her luck if it just happened check in to see how it went this will show her that you care and that you are paying attention even if you re not always around be the last thing she thinks about at night one trick to getting the girl to miss you is to make sure you re on her mind as she s getting ready for bed you can send her a sweet text or plan your phone calls so you talk to her later in the evening so she thinks of you as she goes to bed and maybe even dreams about you she also may wake up thinking about the great conversation you had and will miss you even more as a result talking to her before she gets ready for bed will give you a better chance of really capturing her attention she ll be winding down and will be able to focus on you more easily instead of talking to you while having a million other things going on at the same time of course make sure it s okay for her to talk on the phone late at night you don t want her to get in trouble with her parents give her something that reminds her of you another way to make sure that the girl misses you is to give her something that makes it so you re never far from her mind it can be a necklace you gave her for her birthday a letter you wrote to her a sweatshirt that smells like you that you let her borrow or a book or cd that you thought she would really like these physical objects will make it so you have a bigger presence in her life and she ll be more likely to miss you while you re away you can get her a memento on one of your dates winning her a stuffed animal at a carnival or getting her a small souvenir from a trip you go on together will give her something that reminds her of you you don t need to splurge on this item what s most important is that it makes her think of you not the heft of the price tag write her a sweet note another way to make a girl miss you is to write her a sweet and sincere note about how much you like her it doesn t have to be long or too detailed but it should make her see that you really do care for her you can hand it to her on one of your dates or even mail it to her if you re apart she will keep the note and may even read it over again to be reminded of you giving her some physical proof of how much you care for her can make her miss you even more you shouldn t write the note just to get her to miss you make sure that everything you write is sincere and from the heart if you re too calculating she ll be able to tell ask her questions to show an interest in her life if you want the girl to miss you and to care for you more then you should ask her questions about herself whether you do so in person over the phone or in a letter you don t need to pry or ask her too many things to show her that you care if you re with her in person you can ask her about her family her pets her weekend plans her friends or her hobbies if you re texting her you can follow up about an important event in her life or just ask how her day is going the truth is that if you really want to get a girl to like you you have to show that you re interested in her this is much more important than being the coolest or most fascinating guy around at the end of the day girls just want guys who actually care about them if the girl really feels like you care about her then she ll miss you even more when you re gone make sure you actually remember the answers to your questions if the girl feels like she has to keep repeating herself around you then she ll get the sense that you don t really care treat her well when you re together you don t need to be mr too cool when you re with the girl you like if you want her to miss you when you re gone then you should do your best to make an impression on her when you re together make sure to charm her make her laugh make her feel special and generally let her see that you do care about her without coming on too strong you want her to remember you for the caring smart interesting person that you are so you have to make the most of your time together especially if you don t have a lot of it be attentive pay close attention to her to make sure she s having a good time and that she doesn t need anything like a glass of water or a change of scenery 6 x research source make her laugh don t worry about being romantic all the time relax and be a goofball around her and she ll like you all the more for it let her talk make sure you don t do more than roughly half of the talking you don t want her to feel like you re lecturing her or showing off by talking too much leave your conversations on a good note when you do spend time with the girl you like you should make sure that you don t overstay your welcome instead wait until you re having a great time talking and then tell her that you have to get going as long as you weren t supposed to hang out with her for longer this won t hurt her feelings when the conversation is at its peak she ll be thinking highly of you so you want to leave her with a positive impression of you when you re gone if you hang around too long until you both are struggling to come up with something to talk about then the girl won t remember you as being a fun person to talk to instead leave while you still have plenty of things to say to each other so she feels excited to pick up your conversation the next time don t try too hard to make her jealous though there are some tricks you can pull to make the girl you like be more inclined to miss you you shouldn t try to make her so jealous that she feels like she shouldn t bother with you because you re a player or because she doesn t want to fight for your affection while you don t have to tell her where you ve been all the time don t talk about other girls too much or openly flirt with every girl who comes your way unless you want the girl to get annoyed with you though some light flirting with other girls can make the girl you like see that you re a catch you don t want to push it so far that she feels like you don t care about her if she thinks that you re likely to mess around with other girls when you re away then she won t miss you very much if you see her out you should gather your confidence and give it a minute or two before you go up to her if you act like you don t see her or she s not cool enough for you then she won t be jealous of the people you re talking to she ll just think you re a jerk don t try to be someone else just to win her over as corny as it sounds at the end of the day it s important that you be yourself if you really want to win the girl over you shouldn t try to put on an act or be a guy who you think she d prefer to you instead you should work on letting her see your best attributes and take some time to open up about your more quirky interests though you don t need to act the exact same way around her as you would around your buddies you shouldn t put on an act either or she ll be able to see through it eventually if you really like the girl and want her to miss you then you should make sure the person she s missing is really you not some polished version of who you are though it can take a while for you to open up and show her who you really are you should try to be as genuine as possible when you re getting to know each other don t play too many games sure limiting your phone time or the time you spend together and playing a little hard to get can make the girl more interested in you and can make her more likely to miss you but if you take it too far then you ll just be confusing the girl and may even be confusing yourself in the process if she feels like your entire relationship is based around mind games and she doesn t really know who you are then her patience will wear thin pretty fast if you re kind and affectionate one minute and then cold and distant the next then she ll quickly get frustrated though you don t have to give it all away if she feels like she has no idea what s going on in your head she ll start to give up on you don t be afraid to tell her how you feel about her while it s important to leave her wanting more and missing you you don t want to take playing hard to get so far that she has no idea that you actually do care for her even if you re a bit shy you should tell her that you do like her and that you do want to spend more time with her don t let her do all the work or she may get tired of you because she ll think that you don t really like her you have to be willing to meet her at least halfway if you force her to chase you too much she may go for a guy who is more open with his feelings instead,Relationships

approval the occasional oh that feels good and see a nice relaxed smile on his or her face if so then things are moving in the right direction if your partner pulls away or even outright says they don t like it when you touch their feet then it s time to abort the mission if your partner reacts negatively don t be discouraged you may still be able to turn things around however this does mean that

t make it sound like a fetish yet just tell your partner that he or she specifically has amazing feet this will make it easier for your partner to swallow the news than if you flat out stated that you

you and let your partner see that you have something important to say so you get his or her attention don t act too nervous or your partner will be nervous too just act nervous enough that your partner will see that you really care about what she thinks spit it out be honest just say hey i have a thing for feet or i want you to know that i have a foot fetish that s it there s no need to say why or how long you ve had it or how much you love sexy sexy feet just tell your partner let it out and feel the relief of finally fessing up flood over you make eye contact look at his or her face and wait for a reaction if you hear nothing you can ask what do you think but generally it s a good idea to give your partner some time to process the news react appropriately to your partner s feelings there are a few ways that this news can be taken the best case scenario is if your partner says really that s kinky i don t mind at all however it s more likely that your partner will want more information or won t quite know how to react the worst case scenario is if your partner is completely not accepting of your fetish and thinks that feet are completely gross you ve said your piece though and now it s time to be mature and to deal with your partner s reaction in a calm and adult fashion whatever happens you should be proud of yourself for being honest if your partner accepts your foot fetish on the spot great prepare for a night of kinky fun if your partner needs some time to deal with it take things slow don t try to touch his or her feet too much during your next kissing session wait for your partner to give you the green light 4 x research source if your partner is just flat out not into it then there s no need to not try to force it after all life is short

it and become curious after a while 5 x research source,Relationships

just make an effort to style your hair wear flattering clothes and to look like you spent some time on your appearance this means you should look like a version of your best self not that you should try to look like a celebrity or a supermodel let him see you having a great time the best thing you can do is have a fantastic time without the guy that you want to make jealous 1 x research source this can mean laughing with your girlfriends dancing it up at a party or just doing something that makes you feel happy and free give whatever you re doing all of your attention and the guy will see that you really are having an amazing time and not thinking of him at all what could make him feel more jealous than that if he catches you looking around the room for him or trying to put on an act for him then he won t be likely to get very jealous make sure he really doesn t think he s on your mind at all that will drive him crazy stay busy do things you like to do if you re busy and having

it in front of him or in situations where you know it ll get back to him if you flirt with too many guys in a short period of time however he might catch on especially if you re not normally that much of a flirt but don t make it too obvious because he might think that you re a type of girl who s easy to get and flirt with we don t want to make a bad impression right there s a difference between casually flirting and leading a guy on don t flirt too much with a guy who you know likes you just to get back at someone else because you ll be getting the poor guy s hopes up date other guys

be around the guy you re trying to make jealous act natural let him see you having a great time instead of laughing too hysterically or trying too hard to say look at me i am having such an amazing time without you try ignoring him lightly if he and someone else you know are sitting together on the bus say hi to the friend and not the guy you re trying to make jealous if he reacts immediately he likes you if not he probably doesn t care you don t have to be rude or ignore him completely especially not if he reaches out to you but you shouldn t go out of your way to talk to him or necessarily let him know that you notice him either if he texts you a lot don t get back to him right away give it at least a day or two to make him see that you have better things to do than to get back to him asap even if you don t if he s passing you in the halls and says hi you can say hi back but don t slow down and talk to him you ve got places to go hang out with your guy friends even if you don t actually go on dates it s good to have some guy friends that you hang out with even if you re in a committed relationship there s nothing wrong with having male friends but when you hang out with them

and you ll have a perfect jealousy plan make him sweat a little if you re always available for him you ll lose some of your mystery and mystery can create jealousy for example don t always answer his calls when you call him back a couple hours later you definitely should call him back if you re interested be vague about what you were doing 4 x research source say you were out with a friend or you were just busy just by not answering the phone you may make him wonder what you re doing and who you re with in the same vein if he calls you to ask if you want to do something once in a while it s good to just say that you have other plans even if you don t really use social media you don t have to post a photoshoot of you and ten hot guys playing a casual game of volleyball at the beach however you can use your facebook twitter instagram and other accounts to make the guy see that you re living a great life without him whether you post pictures with guys you know mention an amazing party or museum you went to that weekend or just show the world how much you love your best friends you can use social media to make the guy jealous and annoyed that you have a whole life that does not include him don t post too often though or he ll think the opposite that you have no life just posting something two or three times a week should do the trick don t be too obvious about it a lot of guys believe it or not can actually tell when you re trying to make them jealous sometimes the best thing you can do is give a flirtatious smile to a different guy and the guy whose attention you want will be all ears it s the subtle things that can really make the guy who you want to make jealous take notice so you shouldn t go too far out of your way to make the guy see that you just want him to see how much you don t need him if he s in the same room as you keep doing what you re doing if you change your entire personality just to make the guy jealous he ll be able to tell talk about other guys in front of him you can t be too obvious when you do this don t say i was hanging out with mark all weekend mark is so hot or he ll see that you re just trying to ruffle his feathers instead say something like have you heard of the arctic monkeys mark burned me their newest cd and i just can t stop listening to it the subtle mention of a guy you know will make someone much more jealous than if you raved on and on about all of the guys you know 5 x research source don t name drop too often either mentioning another guy s name just once or twice throughout the course of a conversation will do the trick don t be a total jerk though making a guy jealous will require you to not be the nicest person in the world to him don t take it too far either if you re openly mean talking way too much about being with other guys or just generally not acting like a gracious kind person for the sake of making a guy jealous then there will come a point where he will be turned off and when the other people in your life get annoyed by your behavior too you can be a bit mean especially if you want to get the guy back but don t lose sight of who you are keep your conversation brief if you do end up talking to the guy who you want to make jealous don t give him all of your time talk to him for a few minutes and then tell him that you have to go whether you re going to class meeting up with friends or actually doing absolutely nothing if he thinks he can talk to you for hours until he has to go then guess who has the power in the relationship it s not you even if you do like him and can t stop drowning in his baby blues force yourself to break away don t give him 100 of your attention when you talk to him either make him see that you ve got other things on your mind keep your plans mysterious if he asks about your weekend you can give him a flirty smile and just say it was really amazing you can leave him to guess what you mean by this he ll be likely to think you meant you had an amazing time making out with another guy at the movies instead of celebrating your aunt flo s 50th birthday if you have to get going you don t have to say time for my dentist s appointment instead say i m late for this thing i have to go to he may think it s a date and who are you to say otherwise don t be an open book if you want him to be jealous lead him to guess what you could be up to and to create his own scenarios that can make him jealous don t try to make him jealous for too long if your goal is to date him if you want to make a guy jealous because he broke your heart and you want to get him back then great but if you want to make a guy jealous because you actually like him and think this ploy will get his attention then know your limits a little bit of flirtation and jealousy making is fine at first but if you take it too far then the guy may think you re not interested not a nice person or the kind of girl who gets with every guy once you and the guy begin to make a real connection you can minimize the jealousy antics if you do date the guy you can still keep him on his toes but there are better ways of doing so than making him jealous if you want to start a relationship with the guy then it has to be built on a foundation of trust not doubt and suspicion,Relationships

others if you work with someone you sometimes have to communicate with them it may be easiest to do it through others you don t have to be rude about this do not for example say within the person s earshot something like could you tell jeff who i m not speaking to to put his dirty dish in the sink you can however ask others to deliver information when necessary for example you re working in a group for a work project the annoying person is in your group you may ask one of your group members to talk to the person or you might only reach out to them via email or text message curtail your responses you can t completely avoid talking to someone especially if you see them at work or school you don t want to give a complete silent treatment when someone s talking to you so work on curtailing your responses when someone talks give curt responses like hmmm and okay this will hopefully send the message that you want some space tune out negative behavior if someone is pessimistic or highly critical of things try to ignore it ignoring it may help you stay positive without their negativity affecting you for example if your office mate constantly complains about how much work they have try ignoring them so that you don t feel bad about your own work you shouldn t ignore everything if a co worker always teases you to the point you feel uncomfortable around them confront them you can say would you mind not joking about my outfit i enjoy what i wear but it makes me feel bad when others criticize how i dress find strengths in numbers if necessary if the annoying person is very aggressive towards you adopt the buddy system try to have friends or co workers accompany you places you re likely to see the person friends can for example walk with you between classes or eat lunch with you to keep the annoying person away 2 x research source be formal with the person there is no reason to be rude simply because you re ignoring someone in fact being rude will only escalate the situation when you have to talk to the person do so with formality say things like please excuse me and thank you show the person basic manners while maintaining a somewhat stiff demeanor this will show the person you re not being hostile but you don t want a lot of interactions with them do not taunt the person ignoring someone should not be an aggressive act do not make faces at the person roll your eyes when they talk or blatantly pretend not to hear them when they address you you are now being annoying in return which is not a good way of dealing never taunt someone while you re ignoring them 3 x research source acknowledge their presence when necessary you cannot completely tune someone out especially if you work with that person when necessary acknowledge their presence in a manner that s polite but not overtly friendly for example offer a brief wave or nod when you pass them in the hallway reply to their question of how are you with i m fine thanks 4 x research source whenever you speak to this person keep your sentences short and to the point this will prevent any awkward or uncomfortable chatter walk away when necessary sometimes people may not take the hint if someone continues to annoy you even when you ve tried to subtly indicate you don t want to talk to them it s okay to make an excuse and walk away 5 x research source for example a co worker is being very critical about an aspect of your personal life even though you re giving non comital responses they keep at it say something like okay i appreciate the input but i don t really need it and i have somewhere to be then leave the situation stand up for yourself in the moment sometimes an annoying person may cross a line to the point you feel uncomfortable or threatened in these scenarios it s okay to stand up for yourself in the moment be assertive and address the situation 6 x research source calmly tell the person they crossed a line let them know you do not tolerate this type of behavior for example don t talk to me like that i don t need unsolicited advice document negative behaviors at work or school if you feel uncomfortable because of an annoying person at work or school document this you want to make sure you have information to give to a higher authority if it comes to that 7 x research source each time the person gets on your case briefly jot down what was said who saw it and the date and time if you ever need to raise a formal complaint you ll have a lot of information from which to pull talk to the person about their behavior calmly if someone is consistently annoying you it s okay to calmly address the behavior wait until you can get a moment alone with the person and calmly and collectively explain what they are doing wrong 8 x research source for example i know you don t mean anything by it but i don t love getting teased about my outfits let the person know how the behavior makes you feel it makes me feel uncomfortable at work because people are always pointing out my looks now lastly tell the person where to go from here for example you can say i really don t want you to make comments like that anymore do you understand instead of criticizing the person tell them what types of actions you won t tolerate this will help prevent conflict instead of saying you re so annoying you might say i really need quiet time to get my work done bring in an outside authority figure if someone s behavior does not improve after a direct confrontation call in a higher authority if you re in school let a teacher or principal know if you re at work talk to someone in the hr department you have a right to feel comfortable at your place of work or your school 9 x research source,Relationships

conversation at the end of a date others find that this conversation comes most naturally when they are hanging out together alone either way choose a good day ahead of time do not ask at a time when

relationship talk but it should be a place where you can both express your feelings and discuss your future together consider what is right for you and the guy you should probably have this talk while you two are alone you might broach the question during a walk on the beach at the park or in one of your homes if there a place that is special to both of you such as the site of your first date or a favorite monument you might choose to have the talk there to make it memorable make sure that the guy is not distracted do not ask him during a movie while you are out with friends or when he is working if you ask him while you are in the car or eating at a restaurant he may feel trapped have the conversation in a place where you are both comfortable 14 x research source introduce the question at the right moment while hanging out on your planned day you should focus on staying relaxed wait until a good moment to introduce the topic wait for a moment that feels right or special if

natural segue into the relationship talk if there a period of silence you might bring up the issue say how happy you are in the moment and see if the conversation comes up at the end of your date or hang out you can say hey before you go i wanted to talk to you about something consider waiting for your guy to bring it up first if getting around to calling him your boyfriend isn t too high a priority consider waiting to see if your guy mentions it first this also helps you feel out whether your guy is comfortable with using titles or labels to define your relationship this might be a good option if you are uncertain about your feelings or if you think that he is uncertain about the relationship do not wait around forever for a guy to bring up the question set a date for yourself before you ask him for example you might give him a month before asking him yourself start with a compliment tell the guy what you like about him this flattery will relax him and it will make the relationship question much easier to broach a compliment about his humor intelligence or kindness is a good way to signal how you think about him 15 x research source you might say you know you are so funny i ve never met a guy like you before another good compliment is you are very thoughtful i m so touched by your gestures if he smiles thanks you or compliments you back it may be a positive sign

to develop feelings you might say i ve had such a good time with you so far you re a really unique person and i ve been thinking a lot about our relationship you should probably avoid telling him that you love him at this point he may become scared or worried that the relationship is moving too quickly instead you might say that you are developing feelings or that you really like him ask your guy if he wants to be your boyfriend it is best to ask him directly about whether or not he is ready to be your boyfriend depending on the situation you can approach this question in a number of different ways you can ask him directly by saying do you want to make this official do you want to become my boyfriend if you re uncertain about the status of your relationship you can ask where do you see this relationship going if either of you are dating multiple people you can ask do you want to start seeing each other exclusively if you want to understand how he sees you you might say i want to know what to tell other people when they ask what our relationship is would you say you re my boyfriend establish your expectations you both might have different ideas of what a steady relationship means perhaps he s ready to date you exclusively but not ready to meet your family maybe he wants to have sex but you want to wait when you have the talk you both should clearly state what you expect out of the situation 16 x research source you might begin this conversation by asking him what does being a boyfriend mean to you answer truthfully if he asks you about what you expect in a relationship for example you might say i expect a guy to be faithful and to be honest with me i m not ready for marriage yet but i do want to explore the possibility of a more serious relationship give him time to respond the guy might be feeling pressured or uncomfortable by the question if he appears anxious uncomfortable or hesitant you might want to give him a day or two to think over his answer while it may seem as though he trying not to commit he may just need time to consider whether or not he s ready for it 17 x research source you can say if you need time to think about it that s fine give it some time before you make your decision if he asks for space give him space you can ask how long do you think you need to figure this out try not to bring up the question again until that time has passed if he does not give you a time frame you can ask again after a few days say hey i just wanted to know if you ve given any thought to our relationship have you decided where we stand do not obsessively text call or message him about this issue if he did not give you a straight answer right away you might text him once after you asked the question and again in a day or two give him some space if he needs it to decide handle rejection gracefully if he states that he does not want to be your boyfriend try to remain positive try to smile and let him know that you understand he may be content with continuing a casual relationship or he may want to end things there consider your own feelings before proceeding if he wants to end things respect his choice thank him for your time together but state that you understand you might say i m sorry to hear that but i had fun with you good luck in the future if he wants to continue a casual relationship but you want to end things you might say i think it would best if we stopped seeing each other then if he asks why simply state it seems that we want different things he might state that he wants to stay friends with you do not agree unless you are willing to be just friends if you feel as though this would be difficult be honest say i m not sure that will work out for me you re a great guy but i think i will need some space some men may ghost you or stop contacting you it is natural to feel upset about this but it does not mean that he necessarily dislikes you he may only feel awkward about the situation 18 x research

friends if you re trying to tell if your best guy friend likes you try looking for signs of affection or changes in your relationship that might be an indication of his feelings,watch for bashfulness in romantic movies male leads are often men of fiery passion and debonair confidence in real life guys are often shy nervous and self doubting just like everyone else if you suspect your guy friend has a crush on you looking for the tell tale signs and bashful shyness would be a great place to start does your friend seem ever so slightly nervous in your company does his laugh seem forced or unnatural does he seem to make an effort to perpetually laugh and smile around you even when nothing particularly amusing is happening these are signs that your friend is worried about what you think about him 1 x research source here are a few other things to look for blushing slight awkwardness in conversation a slight reluctance or hesitation when saying goodbye look for suspicious eye contact people with hardcore crushes have a hard time taking their eyes off of the person their heart is set on does your guy friend seem to look you in the eyes more than normal conversation requires does he always smile when he sees you looking back the eyes are said to be the window to the soul even if your guy friend is too shy to admit his affection his eyes may give away everything 2 x research source people who can t take their eyes off of their crush usually realize it just an instant too late if you catch your guy friend staring at you and he seems embarrassed or pretends to look away you may have just caught him in a moment of heartfelt longing look for adoring body language a hidden crush can often have a noticeable effect on a guy s thoughts and behavior subtly and unconsciously changing the way he uses his body does your guy friend s body language seem to imply that he s giving you his full complete attention whether the situation calls for it or not in other words does he make a point to turn and face you when he speaks to you does he seem to straighten up when he notices you does he draw his shoulders back or use an arm to prop himself up on a nearby wall when he talks to you this body language may be betraying secret feelings of affection 3 x research source take note of accidental touching this is one of the oldest tricks in the book many guys with crushes will pounce on any chance to touch the girl of their affections 4 x research source they ll be extra generous with hugs they ll always be the person to hand you something you can t reach they ll accidentally bump into you while walking and so on if your guy friend suddenly seems to be a little more touchy than usual you can be fairly certain he has feelings he s not letting on sometimes smitten guys will actually go as far as to contrive situations where they ll have to touch you if your guy friend for instance seems to become extra clumsy around you and develop a habit of dropping things pay attention to what happens when you pick them up and hand them to him does he subtly brush your hand see whether he makes an effort to be either around you or away from you guy friends who secretly adore their female friend usually want to be around her as much as they can most of the time guy friends harboring a secret crush will consciously or not gravitate towards her standing next to her at social occasions sitting next to her at meals etc sometimes however a guy can be especially shy in this case even though he longs for his friend her presence makes him so nervous that he ll actually find ways not to be next to her subtly pay attention to your guy friend s habits if he seems to end up either right next to you or far away from you whenever you hang out in a group of people you ll know something is up see whether he makes hanging out a special priority if your guy friend likes you hanging out with you will become one of his favorite things to do he ll want to hang out with you as much as he can and will sometimes even cancel his other plans to be able to do so if your guy friend suddenly seems to be contacting you to see what you re up to and find out whether you re busy every day you may be dealing with a lovesick guy pal pay attention to the things you talk about together guys with big crushes on their lady friends will sometimes very subtly allude to their feelings in conversation they do this in a number of ways some try to steer the conversation toward romantic topics asking questions about who their female friend likes and whether she s looking for someone others will want to talk about the practice of dating itself for instance joking about how ridiculous most couples seem to be keep track of the types of conversations you have with your guy friend if they mostly seem to be about romance or dating even if he makes no indication that he s interested in dating you specifically this may be his way of signalling his interest there s an obvious exception to this rule if your guy friend involves you in his love life by asking you for advice with other girls it s usually a sign that he thinks of you as a non romantic friend look out for flirting some guys are less shy than others especially confident guys may even enjoy openly flirting with you if your guy friend has developed a habit of playfully teasing you making silly innuendos or seems to enjoy scandalizing you this shows that at the very least he s thought about you as more than a friend realize that a guy s intentions can be somewhat vague when he flirts many guys have a habit of flirting then playing their flirtation off as a joke if their advances aren t immediately reciprocated still others flat out use flirtation and innuendo as a form of goofing off persistent repeated flirtation however is almost always a sign of something more know a fake date when it happens guys who wish they were dating their gal friend sometimes recreate the atmosphere of a date when they re hanging out with her keep an eye out for this when you meet your guy friend for a friendly meal does he seem a little more formal than usual for instance if he s normally vulgar and loud mouthed does he become quieter and more reserved does he develop good manners out of nowhere does he insist on paying for you if so your guy friend may be taking you on a fake date in an attempt to make the real thing a possibility also pay attention to where he takes you and how he dresses if he takes you to fancier nicer places than you d normally go to while hanging out and he cleans up his appearance you ll know you re on a fake date note how he treats other girls this is one of the most important things to look for when trying to figure out whether a guy friend is into you but it s something that s often overlooked if you think your guy friend is being especially affectionate with you before jumping to conclusions pay attention to the way he interacts with other girls if he acts the same way around other girls that he does around you you may be dealing with natural flirt or extrovert rather than a secret admirer listen when your guy friend talks to you about other girls as noted above if he openly asks you for advice on how to attract and win over other girls he probably doesn t see you as anything more than a friend however if he seems unsatisfied with other girls complaining about how he just can t seem to find the right person this may be his way of hinting that he s interested in you ask friends finding out whether your guy friend likes you or not doesn t have to be guesswork one great way to cut right to the heart of the matter is to simply ask someone who s close to him most groups of guy friends talk about their crushes with each other if your guy friend has a crush on you there s a good chance that one or more of his friends know about it if you can you may want to find a mutual friend someone who s close to both you and your guy friend not only can this person give you helpful advice and help you plan your next steps but since s he is hopefully loyal to you s he s less likely to let your secret slip on the other hand asking someone who s friends with your guy friend and not with you can be riskier there s a good chance with this option that the person you ask will tell your guy friend that you asked about him this can work in your favor if you want your guy friend to know that you re also interested in him but if you don t it can backfire ask your guy friend if you re really confident the simplest most direct way to figure out if he likes you is just to ask him to his face this can be awfully nerve wracking but usually the temporary stress of speaking openly about your feelings is worth the closure of knowing for sure whether your guy friend likes you or not when you ask your guy friend whether he likes you be sure that you re in a private place as most guys will be too shy to talk about their feelings in front of other people some guys unfortunately are also too shy to talk about their feelings in front of you if you ask your guy friend directly whether he likes you or not and he says no but he keeps flirting with you and being affectionate you may have encountered a guy who s too shy to admit his true feelings to anyone there s not much you can do in this case simply live your life and do what you want to do and eventually this guy either will or won t gain some confidence if it turns out that you both like each other ask him out if you find out that your guy friend likes you from one of his friends or from your guy friend himself and you know that you like him back you have no reason not to ask him out this will probably naturally happen anyway once you both know that you like each other enjoy your first date since you re already friends you ll be able to skip the awkward small talk and enjoy your time together as a new couple in our society there s an unspoken stereotype that guys are supposed to ask girls out and not vice versa if your guy friend likes you but is too shy to ask you out don t be afraid to completely ignore this outdated tradition there s no reason that you should wait to be happy until you re asked out in the proper way especially when the proper way is a relic of an earlier more formal time 5 x research source,Relationships

how to hate a person you loved a lot,when someone you love hurts you very badly it can be difficult to get over it it may feel like the best thing to do is turn your love into hate but actually that will only make things harder for you as hate isn t the opposite of love they re both strong emotions that take up a lot of your energy if you want to stop feeling the pain of losing someone you love whether it be through a breakup fight death or something else the best thing you can do is deal with your emotions and work on moving forward in life,delete the person s contact info if this person will no longer be part of your life you should delete their contact information this might help prevent you from calling texting or emailing them you might remember their phone number or their email address but removing them from your phone computer tablet address book etc can make it at least a little bit more difficult for you to quickly contact them for example if you delete your ex s contact information from your phone it ll be less tempting to just tap their name and send a text or give them a call at the very least it ll make you think before you do so block their phone number if the person still calls or texts you if you have a smart phone you can download an app that blocks their calls and texts so that you don t receive notifications doing this is particularly useful if you re working hard to keep your mind off of them as every time they call text you ll be reminded of them and you may be tempted to respond filter their email if they often contact you via email have their messages immediately directed into a separate folder instead of your inbox you can do this by creating an email filter directions on how to do this will differ depending on the provider block the person on social media if you re struggling to get over someone having them on your facebook twitter etc is a terrible idea instead of just deleting them block them this way you won t see anything that they post and vice versa it may be tempting to see what the person is up to on facebook twitter instagram or some other social media site avoid the urge to check up on them as this will only make it more difficult to get over them and move on with your own life erase past communications delete old texts and other communications such as emails fb messages whatsapp chats etc you have better things to do with your time than pour over those old messages and feel upset think carefully before erasing photographs before getting rid of photos think about whether they depict a part of your life that you really want to forget forever as time goes on you might look back on the relationship or at least the time period in your life fondly if there s a chance you ll regret getting rid of the photos consider putting them in a box or on to a flash drive and then giving them to a friend for safe keeping until you re feeling well enough to look at them again place physical items in a box go around your room or house and remove anything that reminds you of the person you may want to put those things in a box until you feel ready to deal with them you may want to donate or even burn those things at some point but for now just stow them away so that they re not constant reminders of your loss if you do decide to burn things ensure that you do so in a safe area where having a fire is legal for example an outdoor fire pit not your bedroom floor know that you have control over your feelings studies have shown that we have a better chance of regulating our feelings when we view them scientifically as controllable albeit perhaps unexpected points of data in the experiment of life 1 x research source if you received unexpected results in an experiment you d examine the experiment see where it deviated and look at the results in light of the deviation you d then come up with a plan for your next steps it may feel sociopathic but it really can help to approach your broken heart in this way it may not feel as though you have control over your feelings right now but with some persistence you can train your brain to respond in a controlled manner for example to view things calmly and objectively instead of taking them personally accept your feelings losing someone you love can throw you through a tornado of emotions shock numbness disbelief anger sadness fear even relief and happiness you might even feel some of these at the same time instead of fighting your feelings try to accept them and allow them to just be it can help to take a step back and try to observe your emotions detach yourself from them remind yourself that what you re feeling is totally natural you might say to yourself i m grieving the loss of this relationship and these are the feelings involved with that 2 x research source record your feelings you can do this by writing them down or even recording yourself speaking about them the important thing is not to keep your feelings bottled up inside as this can make it more difficult to move on some experts recommend journalling every day this can help you get in touch with your feelings and even figure out how to get over them if you re out and you feel the need to vent use a notepad or a note taking app on your phone to jot down what you re feeling recording your feelings can be particularly useful when you want to communicate with the person you miss or are upset with instead of contacting them write them a letter or record yourself saying what you d like to say to them do not send them the message though this is just to help you you might even find it useful to destroy the letter recording once it s done don t beat yourself up it takes 2 people to start a relationship and 2 people to end it this means you did not have complete control over the relationship as you can only control yourself don t play the relationship over and over again in your head don t dwell on what could have been done differently it s over now and in any case it may have had little to do with you for example you might have just wanted different things in life instead of asking yourself why me or telling yourself i m worthless think about what you would have changed about how you behaved and use that to grow and move on rather than beating yourself up work on taking care of yourself you can start by feeling proud of yourself for having the maturity to want to grow from this experience remember the bad things when a relationship ends many of us fixate on the good things and torture ourselves thinking about what we re missing out on by reminding yourself of the bad things in your relationship you can start to see the breakup as a positive thing in addition to the things you didn t like about them and the relationship think about whether the person brought out things in you that you didn t like for example when i was with you i was flakey to my friends and always ditched them for you i also didn t pursue my own hobbies any more and felt like i was just becoming a version of you it can be helpful to make a list of all the bad things in the relationship just make sure that you keep it in a safe space or destroy it don t show it to anyone else especially not the person you re trying to get over it ll only cause drama and make it harder for you to move on don t hate the person when someone does something hurtful to someone else it often comes from a place of hurt within that person that s why it s important to see them with compassion 3 x research source instead of feeling

you trust studies have shown that people recover faster from trauma if they can talk about it 4 x research source whether it s your friends and family or people you re close with online reach out to people who you know will take your feelings seriously and help console you don t talk to people who will be dismissive of your feelings as they will only make you feel worse if you re really struggling with your feelings you might even consider seeing a counsellor a good counsellor will be able to give you practical advice for moving on while it s healthy to talk about your feelings you need to make sure that it s not all you talk about otherwise you ll risk alienating the people closest to you if you re worried you may be talking about it too much ask the person you re talking to how they re feeling a good friend will let you know what s up without getting upset at you don t dwell studies have shown that while it is necessary to let your feelings out if you dwell excessively on them you may suffer the same negative consequences as you would if you kept your feelings bottled up 5 x research source studies have shown that focusing on yourself and not taking action to get out of your own head and lift your mood can land you in long term depression 6 x research source be patient with yourself healing from an ended relationship takes time don t expect yourself to get over it right away you may never fully stop loving this person but with time the love will fade it s likely that one day you ll look back and be able to smile at how intensely you thought you loved this person when all they are to you now is a memory of a very different time in your life stay positive as you try to get over this person you ll have good days and bad ones being positive doesn t mean ignoring your bad days it means believing that the good ones will come again some days you might even find it difficult to get out of bed that s okay have a positive attitude toward it it can be helpful to even let yourself have a whole day in bed just reading or watching movies or listening to sad music and crying your eyes out tell yourself okay i ll take this day to acknowledge my sadness but tomorrow i ll go for a run i know i m strong enough to get through this view your relationship as an experiment examine the data of your failed relationship where did it go wrong studies show that viewing your relationship scientifically can help you regain a better sense of self and heal more quickly after a breakup 7 x research source try to take a step back and consider what the contributing factors might have been that could have caused the breakup just remember not to spend too much time on it you are trying to learn a lesson and grow from it not beat yourself up over where you went wrong this doesn t necessarily mean thinking about where you went wrong it might even be something simple like we are actually very different people with different goals you can have fun with this by

someone who you love it can feel like you ve lost half of yourself it will help you move on to rebuild your sense of who you are apart from the person you loved and lost 8 x research source a good writing exercise to build your concept of self is to simply label a page who am i or what makes me me and then note your responses don t forbid yourself from thinking about the person studies have shown that forbidding yourself from thinking about something will only make you think about it more 9 x research source instead of telling yourself not to think bout the person you want to get over when the thought comes into your mind gently remind yourself that they re no longer part of your life and then put your attention back on something that benefits you 10 x research source give yourself a set number of minutes each day to think about the person when someone we love leaves us our minds can become consumed with thoughts about them telling yourself not to think about the person doesn t work but telling yourself not now later does whenever a thought about the person comes into your head push it away and tell yourself that you ll return to the thought later when you ve reached the time in the day that you are allowed to think about that person when the time comes you can sit quietly and think about them all you want set a timer to make sure you don t go too long you might try starting with two 10 minute periods a day one in the morning and one in the evening try not to make the person the last thing you think about every night if possible read an engaging book or do yoga before bed thoughts of the person might still come into your mind but you can tell them to go away until the next time you ve set to think about them visualize yourself letting go sit down somewhere comfortable and try to visualize a box in front of you put all of your memories into that box and then close the lid hold the imaginary box in your hands and then blow it away when the thoughts come back into your head later tell yourself no those are gone now and try to quickly think of something else live in the moment each day try to focus on the moment in which you re living to dwell on the past or future might only make you long to be elsewhere in time this isn t useful as the only time you have is right now it s still important to have goals and work towards them but you do not need to think about these goals all the time if you do you might be so focused on the future that you forget to do the things that must be done in the present in order to reach your goals you don t want to

some stand up comedy or something else that will bring a smile to your face no matter how small it is get in your own way do things that will prevent you from giving in to the temptation to contact the person you re trying to get over this means making plans on nights when you know you ll miss them most and staying busy if you know that you ll feel lonely on friday night and want to call them make plans for friday night do this even if you re depressed and don t want to do anything make plans and try to live in the moment while you re out with others have fun with other people and by

this might not be possible for the first few weeks or months you ll know you re ready when you re not thinking of that person every single waking second of the day take care of yourself when you re dealing with grief it s more important than ever to take good care of yourself both mentally and physically do things that make you feel good on the inside and outside eat well drink plenty of water get enough sleep and exercise meditate you might even buy yourself a new outfit or get a nice haircut experts say that stress is the primary trigger for indulging in addictions and this includes exes

the first day and even that might be a struggle but if you do it every day maybe within a week you ll be able to come up with five good things about yourself maybe after a few months you ll be able to fill a page know that you re in control of your life you are responsible for your own happiness and your own life choices no one else is if you don t do things to lift your mood and change your life

research source set goals having meaningful goals to work toward will give you a compelling reason to stop dwelling on the person you lost and start working to make your life better for example if you re about to go from high school to college challenge yourself to get the best marks possible and to get into a college program that you will love if you re unsure of what you want to do next in life take time to explore your options if you re in school see a career counsellor if you re not try asking some close friends and family about your strengths and what they think you d be good at know that you ll meet someone else it may not feel like it right now but you ll meet someone else who works even better with you when you meet them you ll be grateful that things didn t work out with the person you re trying to get over right now the more you grow the more you know what works and this will help you find someone who better suits you know when you re ready to start a new relationship there is no set time for how long it takes to get over someone it varies by person and relationship some people may only need a couple of months while others will need years 19 x research source if you re

that in jeopardy make it clear that you really do take responsibility for your actions don t say something like i m sorry that you feel that i did something wrong or i m sorry you got so mad when i

going to do anything stupid like that again i won t go off the grid and you can always call or text me to know what i m doing so you don t have to worry just remember that actions speak louder than words giving her your plan not to hurt her again will go a long way but making sure to stick to your word is even more important show her you ll change if there are specific steps you need to take to not do what you did again then you should tell her exactly what you have planned so she knows you re serious about not being a repeat offender look her in the eyes and tell her what you plan on doing to be a better boyfriend and better person she ll be touched that you tried as hard as you did if you show her that you really do want to improve and won t go back to your old ways you can say something like i m so sorry i called you names the next time i get so worked up i m going to step outside and take a breather or give myself a few minutes to speak i ll make sure i ll think before i speak next time so i don t end up saying something i don t mean again i m even thinking about taking anger management classes if i can t solve this on my own if you tell her about your plan make sure

show you re really paying attention to her you don t have to put on an act if you really do care for her then it should be pretty obvious to her as soon as you start apologizing give her time if she s not ready to accept your apology even if you ve said your part and have done a convincing job of showing her how much you wish you hadn t messed up it doesn t mean that she s going to jump back into your arms she may not be ready to accept your apology or even to spend another minute with you if this is the case then you need to be patient and not put pressure on her to accept your apology before she s ready to you re the one who made a mistake and now the ball is in her court 2 x research source be patient with her if she doesn t want to hang out or even to talk for a while you have to be respectful of that while you may want to check in to see how she is from time to time you don t want to overwhelm her or she ll be even more upset tell her that you ll be waiting and ready and that you hope to see each her again soon let her see how hurt you are and how much you want to see her again and to make it up to her take it slow if she doesn t want to spend 24 7 with you right now then you have to be respectful of that she may be slowly coming around to spending time with you again and you have to be understanding that she needs some time to try to ease into the relationship spend time doing casual things like watching tv or eating lunch together and don t try to whisk her away on a romantic dinner date or weekend vacation if she can barely look at you start slow doing the simple things you used to love to do together and take it from there this goes for being affectionate and intimate too don t try to smother her with hugs touches kisses or attempt to hold her hand or put your arm around her every chance you get before she s ready or this will actually slow down the process further let her make the calls if she s up for going to a party together then you can do it but you shouldn t make her go out in public with you if she s not ready for it be dependable you have to be as dependable as possible if you want to rebuild your relationship you have to be there for your girlfriend and make her see that you re going to help her out if she needs a ride or a favor show up for a date at the time you say you ll be there and be there for her if she s upset and needs to talk something out dependability is one of the most important qualities of a good boyfriend and if you want her to trust you again and to feel safe with you don t flake on her if you weren t able to do something you said you d do you better have a really good excuse be there whenever she wants to talk or needs some advice let her see that you want to go out of your way to hear her out and make her feel happy being dependable is important but you have to make sure she doesn t feel like she can walk all over you just because you messed up you want to maintain your dignity be available to earn her trust back you have to be available when she tries to reach you this doesn t mean you have to drop everything to do what she wants you to do but it does mean that you should try to pick up your phone as quickly as you can when she calls or texts you let her see that you ve got nothing to hide and if you re going to have your phone off for a while like if you re going to be watching a long movie in the theatre or at your baseball game then give her a head s up so she doesn t wonder why you ve gone off the grid if you re out with your friends let her know where you ll be and what you ll be up to though she doesn t have to track your every move you should generally try to be open about your plans so she doesn t worry that you ll hurt her again if you re apart for a few days then give her a call and check in with her to show that she s still on your mind don t try too hard while it s important to go out of your way to get her to trust you again you don t want to be trying so hard that it seems like you re putting on an act or not being yourself at all if every word you say or every thing you do makes it obvious that you re just trying to get in her good graces again then she ll feel like you re not being real with her you can make a big effort to win her over again but you shouldn t forget to be yourself after all that s who she started dating isn t it you can be more helpful kind and loving than you normally are but you shouldn t completely forget yourself in the process make sure you still make time to pursue your own interests and don t make your life all about making your girlfriend happy you can get her flowers or chocolate if things are going really well but if you give her too many gifts when she s just not feeling it then she ll think you re trying to buy her love back don t give her any reasons to be jealous if your girlfriend needs to forgive you because you were unfaithful to her then you have to make sure she doesn t have any reason to be afraid that you ll do it again when other girls are around you can talk to them but don t openly flirt with them or stare at them if you can help it when you get a phone call or a text don t go to the other room or look shady when you answer it and let her know that it s just your mom or buddy calling do what you can to make her see that you only have eyes for her okay so it may be impossible to fully stop checking out other beautiful women but you can try to minimize it as much as you can around your girlfriend thinking about how much it will upset her if you were out with your buddies and some girls you knew came out you can let her know about it so she doesn t find out from someone else slowly return to doing the things you love together as you work to make her forgive you you and your girlfriend can begin to do the same things you used to love together whether it s hiking cooking watching all of the year s oscar nominated films or going to trivia night with your friends you shouldn t force it but once you both feel ready to return to some of your old routines you should let her see how happy and grateful you are that you can start to go back to how things were again take the time to really enjoy your girlfriend s company and to make her feel special focus less and less about making it up to her and more and more on enjoying your relationship again if she had any unrelated complaints when you upset her such as the fact that you re always late to dates make sure you acknowledge those as well make her feel loved as your relationship gets more and more stable again you can make sure that your girlfriend knows how much you care about her if you re already saying i love you then you shouldn t forget to say it at least once a day if you re not make sure you compliment her and make her feel good about herself when you re together let her know and see how happy you are to be with her and how much you love dating her you don t have to smother her with affection but you should never take her for granted don t assume that she knows how much you care for her just because you re hanging out together let her see how much you care through your words and your affection write her sweet love notes or even hand her a full letter saying how much you care for her be thoughtful if she s mentioned a new book she wants to read let her know that you listen to her by giving it to her find something new to do together though returning to your old routine can make your relationship feel more stable you can also work to discover new things together to keep your relationship fresh and to do things that don t remind her of the time you hurt her you can discover a new sport take a class together or even take a mini vacation to a campsite or beach over the weekend don t just do whatever she wants to do to please her try to find something new and exciting that you both will love it doesn t have to be too elaborate you can just learn to make pasta together join a bowling league together or discover a new director together the most important thing is that you both keep your relationship feeling fresh you don t have to do too many new things at once making an effort to do at least one new thing every week or two while continuing to do some of the old things you love together will keep your relationship going strong communicate openly in order to maintain a healthy relationship you have to be committed to communicating openly and listening to her as often as possible don t keep your feelings bottled up inside or become passive aggressive when you re mad instead make time to talk to her about any problems in your relationship so that you both feel that you re on the same page make sure to really listen to her and to address her concerns while making her aware of how you re feeling strong communication is key for any strong relationship an important part of communication is learning to compromise make sure you can both find a way to make each other happy when making a decision and that one person doesn t always get his or her way all of the time work on reading your girlfriend s expressions and body language she may be upset without telling you and there will be times when you have to ask her what s wrong she ll appreciate the fact that you re paying such close attention to her work on moving past the incident once you ve apologized and have worked on rebuilding a healthy relationship you have to be able to move past what happened while your girlfriend may not be able to completely forget what happened even if she has forgiven you you both have to be able to accept what happened and to focus on the present and the future instead of the past if you both keep bringing up what happened all the time then you won t ever be able to fully move forward you should work on enjoying the relationship on its own terms instead of being fully focused on making it up to your girlfriend of course if your girlfriend wants to talk about what happened you shouldn t avoid it but you should also make an effort to have other things to talk about as well know when the damage is done unfortunately there may be times when your girlfriend won t be able to forgive you no matter how hard you ve tried to change for her if you ve done too much damage to repair the relationship then it s important to be aware of this so you both know when to cut your losses if you ve been trying to make things feel normal for months and just keep going back to what happened keep fighting about the past and still can t open up to each other then you both may have to accept that you can t fix the relationship anymore if you re getting the sense that your girlfriend won t ever be able to fully forgive you then you should have an honest conversation with her about it if this is the case then the sooner you know the better if you have to end the relationship because of what you did then the best thing you can do is view it as a learning experience and make sure not to make the same mistake again,Relationships

relaxed not forced forced body language looks awkward and makes people think that you re trying to put on a show you may want to practice open confident body language when you re alone remember their name and something about them remembering and using someone s name makes them feel special so use it regularly in conversation you can also show you like them and ultimately make them like you by following up on some tidbit of information you know about them 4 x research source for example you might say hey noah how did that math test go if the last time you spoke they mentioned having to

out of place and inappropriate get them talking about their hobbies and interests if you can spot some common interests that the two of you share that s a great place to steer the conversation if not ask some open ended questions to learn more about what the person likes 6 x research source for example you might ask what brings you to this conference or what sort of music do you like open ended questions require more expansive answers that keep the conversation going make a thoughtful gesture do something for the person without them asking however make sure that you aren t acting inappropriately choose something that would commonly be done by a friend or acquaintance whichever is appropriate for your relationship for example if they miss a class ask them if they want a copy of your notes if they re ill bring them chicken noodle soup be an attentive listener people enjoy talking about themselves so let them orient to face them and listen to their entire message without interrupting 7 x research source once they pause paraphrase what they said back to them to be sure you re clear on what they re sharing this lets them know that you re truly listening and provides the

understanding keep in mind that if you spend the whole time talking about yourself you won t get to know the person better and they may not think you re interested in them let them do most of the talking pay them a compliment compliments make people feel special but it also endears them to you comment on their appearance a particular skill they have or an insight they make during conversation try not to focus on only one area like appearance 8 x research source say cool shirt i m a harry potter fan too or wow that s a really neat idea make them laugh people like people of good cheer so

source you might say hey i remember you said you re good with computers my laptop keeps freezing up can you take a look at it for me please do a favor the same logic that ensures someone will like you if you ask them for help works in reverse help the person in some small way and they will like you even more 11 x research source if you know the person always forgets their pencil when they come to class have one ready for them if they desperately need someone to watch their pet over the weekend offer to do it prioritize spending time with them typically people want to spend time with people who

research source this also means being there when you say you will if you say you ll hang out on thursday don t flake on them to hang with someone else let your quirks show you may think it s a good idea to act totally cool in front of this person in reality they ve got quirks and they ll feel much more comfortable around you if you don t hide yours sing a tad off key without being embarrassed confess that you still watch your favorite childhood cartoons or admit that you dip your fries in barbecue sauce 13 x research source sharing the little silly things that define you will bring you closer to the other person also a minor disclosure deepens your relationship since you probably haven t told everyone this information communicate honestly but with tact most people like others who

true to yourself even at the risk of someone not liking you 15 x research source sticking to your beliefs takes courage it s not easy to be the one who stands up to a bully or refuses to go along with a harmful or dangerous prank being true to yourself might make you unpopular with some people but could also attract those with whom you share common values respect yourself having healthy self respect means you like yourself no matter what when you re communicating with others avoid comparing yourself to others or belittling yourself in any way 16 x research source remind yourself of your strengths by listing them out to yourself you might say i m a great listener or i can make people laugh respecting yourself also means not doing anything that goes against your personal beliefs or

other girls guys who are in a relationship rarely pay a whole lot of attention to other women a faithful boyfriend won t check out other girls as they walk by or make comments about a woman s appearance to his friends 6 x research source on the other hand if you have evidence that he might have a girlfriend but still hits on other women he might be a cheater so be wary if he gives out his

him off that you like him and have been talking to his friends is a way to get his attention ask him in person if he has a girlfriend if you still can t find out if he is dating another girl ask him outright avoid texting instant messaging or anything electronic because it s important that you re able to hear how he reacts to your question wait for a good time to ask if you re hanging out with a group of people you shouldn t delve into someone s personal relationship status be patient and wait until it s just the two of you to inquire about any girlfriend you don t want to make him uncomfortable by making his personal life public in front of people be direct when asking him about a possible girlfriend try not to beat around the bush when you ask to avoid making things too awkward you could say i ve been meaning to ask you do you have a girlfriend as long as you keep your tone casual he shouldn t feel pressured by your question if he doesn t and has been oblivious that you have a crush on him he may notice your interest when you ask him about his relationship status don t worry too much if he says yes there will always be other guys not all the good ones are taken notice if he avoids your question it s not a good sign if he doesn t answer you with a simple yes or no any hint of caginess or nervousness is not a good sign if he stumbles over his words or tries to give you an excuse he s probably in a complicated situation it s best to stay away from a guy who isn t honest anyways 8 x research source if he s outright and honest then you have a clear answer but if he hesitates take that as a red flag that he may be hiding his relationship react respectfully and maturely no matter the answer he gives finding out that a guy you re interested in is taken can be a tough blow but keep cool when he gives you an answer whether it s positive or negative if he has a girlfriend don t have a meltdown in front of him or at least wait until you re alone to be emotional about a missed opportunity so you can save face the best news would be if he s single respond with something like oh well that s interesting to maintain your mysteriousness and not reveal your hand that you re interested in him no matter how much you like a guy it s not worth breaking up a relationship just so you can try and date him,Relationships

of being the porn police this behavior causes distrust in the relationship and can cause him to keep his porn use hidden from you or cause tension and discomfort while talking about the subject if you feel okay with the porn the concept of keeping him from watching it should not arise if it is only certain genres of porn that upset you make sure to talk about this with him and let him know why it

make your boyfriend only think of you sexually that is not reasonable men and women both fantasize about people who are not their lover it could be movie stars people from real life a cartoon whatever it may be it is hypocritical to believe that you can have freedom over your fantasies and he can not try not to be paranoid during your time together when you and your boyfriend are hanging out watching tv going for a run or having a romantic dinner understand that you may have thoughts about the porn and you may question if he is thinking about the porn while you spend time together for men usually their porn use is separate from the relationship and used as non attachment and impersonal fulfillment of pleasure enjoy every moment you spend with your boyfriend and know that he s enjoying every moment too define what cheating means to you you do not think of porn as cheating or you do think of it as cheating some men and women are not okay with porn and know how they feel about it being in a relationship if you are uncomfortable and feel like his excitement of watching other women engage in sexual acts is cheating then that may mean you are not okay with the porn do not feel like you have to rationalize his porn use and discount your feelings if you feel that it is not cheating then you probably just think of it as a pleasurable movie the videos do not pose a threat to your relationship and you may define cheating as being something you can only do with a real person your definition of cheating matters and understanding what your partner s definition of cheating is will help you feel more secure in your relationship or find points where you both will need to find compromise ask yourself if you have any objections to having porn in your relationship if you have values that don t align with the genre of porn he watches communicate that if you feel like the porn has a negative effect on your trust for him if he was hiding it from you then understand that the porn may not be the core issue dishonesty could be the primary issue to deal with it is essential to understand your own feelings and beliefs and ask yourself if you can see yourself in a long term relationship with your partner and not having an issue with porn it s important to be honest with yourself an d be clear with your partner if you are triggered by porn and have insecurity because it brings you to your past you may want to explore yourself further and see if porn is the issue or if there is trauma you need to work through if you have a hard time sorting through your feelings about the porn seeking a friend who is understanding may help if you feel that you can t consult a friend there is professional help or advice online and in person available it is okay to feel like you are okay with porn and then later feel not okay with it people change everyday and getting to know yourself while getting to know another person in a relationship can be difficult identify your insecurities if any of them root directly to porn and the nature of porn then you may not be okay with porn itself if the insecurities you have go back to dishonesty trust or intimacy you should consider bypassing pornography as being an irritant to the initial core problem if you have had cheating boyfriend in the past or your boyfriend has cheated on you you may feel like porn is a window for cheating or that he may still be cheating on you know if he has a real problem with pornography there s a difference between being a casual porn watcher and having a porn addiction if your boyfriend is obsessed with watching porn and sneaks away to watch porn every chance he gets then he may be having a real problem with a porn addiction and should seek help though most of the time this is not the case it s important to know that it s a possibility ask yourself if his porn habits are affecting your relationship replacing the time he spends with you and generally making it difficult to be romantically involved if this is the case then you may have a real problem on your hands and should discuss next steps consider watching porn with him while this isn t for every couple if you see nothing morally objectionable about porn though you have never watched it before or if you ve seen it before and are curious about what it s like to watch porn as a couple then see if you and your boyfriend can have a kinky time watching porn together your boyfriend may not think this is a good idea and if he doesn t you shouldn t push him on it too much and if you do watch it with him watch it for the enjoyment of watching something sexy together not to gauge his reaction to see how much he really likes it this will make him self conscious and unlikely to enjoy himself try to use the porn to discuss your boyfriend s sexual fantasies many men say that they watch porn as an escape and that they d never want to do the same things with their girlfriend that they see people doing on television yet sometimes the stuff he watches on porn can make him yearn for something with you even if it s just some harmless role playing or some time spent having sex in a new position or making out in a new location talk to him about it to see if the conversation may take your own relationship to a new level your boyfriend may want something in the bedroom but may be too shy to ask unless you press him of course this doesn t mean that you have to do anything that you re uncomfortable with the fact of the matter is a lot of porn does objectify women and you don t have to do anything that makes you feel demeaned or worthless and hey you can use this as a time to tell your boyfriend about any fantasies you may be having as well this doesn t mean that your boyfriend will jump for joy when you ask him about what he s watching during his porn solo sessions it may make him uncomfortable and that s only natural too discuss your next steps once you ve had an open and honest discussion about watching pornography then you and your boyfriend can discuss what next steps you can take here are some options you may decide on breaking up though breaking up over your boyfriend watching a regular amount of porn alone may not be that common the porn watching can be indicative of larger issues that may have brought the relationship to a status of beyond repair watching it together if you don t find porn offensive and are curious about what turns your boyfriend on then this may be an option for you just make sure he s comfortable with it having your boyfriend try to watch porn less or not when there s a chance you may walk in on him if that s what you really want though you don t want to force your boyfriend to curb his desires or to become too secretive around you this may be the best option you come up with seek a relationship counselor if it s necessary if your boyfriend is suffering from a porn addiction and you want to help him overcome it then you may choose to see a counselor together or to have him see a counsellor or your conversation about porn may lead to your realization of larger problems in the relationship such as issues related to infidelity or insecurity if this is the case then you may need to seek outside help for your relationship,Relationships

what to say think up some things you could say in advance simply describing a previous romantic encounter with your partner could be a great start you may also find it helpful to discuss your doubts

not at work school or some other public location where you feel comfortable to let go this will likely be your bedroom or if you live alone your living room tidy up the room and lay out some blankets and pillows so that you have somewhere nice to sit lie while you talk on the phone light some candles and play some soft music if you play soft music make sure it s quiet enough that you can hear your partner instrumentals are probably best so that you don t have to compete with other people speaking singing in the background as you set the scene start thinking about what you d like to say or do to your partner if you can t think of anything remember romantic times you haven t had with your partner in the past and think about how you d describe them to him her start feeling sexy try to be ready 30 to 60 minutes before the date use this time to do things that help you get in the mood if you have a camera phone you can even take a photo of yourself and send it to your partner with a flirty

before your date begins curb your laughter laughing at the wrong time can throw a wrench into any sexual encounter whether it be in person online or on the phone if your concerns about laughing are making it difficult for you to enjoy phone sex it may be best to tell your partner about it ahead of time example i am willing to try phone sex but i m worried that i ll laugh and ruin everything what should we do if i laugh bringing it up to your partner in this way should help diminish some of the anxiety around it if you and your partner are really comfortable with each other then a bit of laughter won t ruin the sexual experience work on recognizing when you re going to have a laughing fit and then kicking it aside even if you have to acknowledge it before moving on fake it until you make it if nothing is working and you re really struggling to get into phone sex try taking a step back and pretending that you re someone who likes phone sex do this for at least a few minutes that might be all it takes for you to actually feel turned on and have more fun with it it may feel insincere at first but once you re more comfortable with pretending to have phone sex you might find that you re actually enjoying it after that it should come much more naturally to you without having to pretend close your eyes and visualize another way to step outside of yourself during phone sex is to close your eyes and visualize what you and your partner are describing this may help you step into the scene that you re imagining and leave your doubts and inhibitions at the door if you have trouble imagining your and your partner s words try developing your imagination by reading some erotica or watching love scenes in romantic films find your phone sex personality if being yourself just isn t working when it comes to phone sex try pretending to be someone else completely having an alter ego can help you remove yourself from the experience just be sure to explain to your partner that this is what you re doing otherwise he she might be confused if you lower your voice or refer to yourself by a different name maybe your alter ego has a lower voice and or likes to talk dirty maybe your alter ego has desires that you never knew you had you and your partner might even consider creating alter egos together also known as role playing ensure that you re comfortable with your partner if your partner is really pushing for phone sex and you re having trouble giving him her what he she wants ask yourself what you re really uncomfortable with is it the phone sex or your partner or both if it s the phone sex that s the problem you should be able to talk to your partner openly about your concerns and together you can work through them if your partner cares about you he she won t try to push you into do something you re uncomfortable with if you re uncomfortable with your partner maybe you re just not ready to have phone sex with him her yet maybe you re not sure if you can trust him her to keep your sessions private or maybe you re worried that he she will judge you if this is the case it s okay to tell your partner that you d like to wait until you feel more comfortable talk to your partner let your partner know why it s hard for you to enjoy phone sex if the reason is that you re uncomfortable with your partner try to find a respectful and non accusatory way of telling

you re wearing to tell you you re sexy and to talk about what he she is doing to you once you feel more comfortable you can start talking and initiating more if your partner knows you re nervous about the experience then he she should be okay with letting you follow his her lead a bit more don t be afraid to ask for help if you re in the middle of what s supposed to be a hot and heavy phone session don t be afraid to let your partner know when you can t think of something to say or when you need a bit more help try not to be too apologetic saying sorry or beating yourself up for not knowing what to say might ruin the mood just keep it light and fun asking for help isn t a big deal you might even find a way to ask for help while remaining in the realm of romantic language for example i m so turned on right now i can t think straight maybe you can guide me other examples of things to say i can t think of what to do next can you take over or my mind just went blank keep going and i ll think of something give yourselves time to get into a sexy groove even on the phone foreplay is important don t go straight from saying hello to saying how turned on you are start with sexy small talk

only help you feel more comfortable it ll build anticipation and make your phone session that much steamier just be sure that your small talk is light hearted don t rant about work or your upcoming school assignments if your partner is moving faster than you ask him her to slow down until you re ready you can say something like i m just enjoying the sound of your voice right now can we wait a little longer before taking our clothes off don t be afraid to admit it if you just can t make it work if you feel like you ve tried everything and just can t make it work tell your partner that phone sex is not for you if your partner wanted you to do something in bed that you didn t want to do you would tell him her it wasn t your thing having phone sex is no different if your relationship is

feelings in a long hand letter instead of typing or texting it it will allow you to really convey your feelings in a personal way while still having the advantage of being able to edit your words before you send or deliver your letter get your feelings out in the open tell the person how you feel about them and ask them how they feel about you it is not necessary to ask for a commitment you

effective communication in a relationship you should approach conflict and disagreement with the perspective that you are a team instead of viewing a disagreement as your chance to prove a point or win an argument try to think of it as a challenge to come up with a mutually beneficial solution don t sit on negative feelings for too long without expressing them to your partner otherwise you could become resentful if you find yourself angry or sad about the relationship think about why you re feeling that way and then talk to your partner about it let them know how you feel and what you think could help balance your needs and your partner s needs we are often taught to put other people before our own needs and being selfless in a relationship can be a great feature however you should not

to drop your plans for them get them out of a bind or be physically affectionate with no commitment know that relationships mean different things to different people as we go through life we will meet a variety of people and will build complicated personal relationships with them there are various types of relationships such as friend work romantic and family relationships it is important to remember that relationships are as individual and different as the people who are a part of them there are different expectations in every relationship sometimes these expectations are made clear by talking about them but other times they are just unspoken rules that develop as people spend time together learn about types of friendships friendships are platonic meaning there is no sexual interest involved these relationships fulfill our needs as humans to be around other people who we feel are similar to us and feel valued secure and appreciated for who we are some relationships are casual acquaintances and include people you might pass in the halls and smile at or say hello acquaintances help you feel connected to the outside world but they re generally people you wouldn t call up to hang out the only expectation you have of your casual acquaintances is politeness other relationships are casual friends you may have met by chance for instance because you are in the same class and you may interact on a regular basis based on your shared interest or common schedule you may chat with these people about surface level topics but you probably don t know much about them as individuals more intimate friends are the people you trust and choose to be with when you have a choice these are the people that you feel that you can be yourself around and you don t have to worry about impressing them intimate friendships can require a lot of work to maintain because you owe each other attention and time as part of your friendship best friends are those intimate friends who have proven to be faithful loyal and trustworthy these are often relationships that have stood the test of time best friends feel as if they know each other inside out not everybody has or needs best friends and that s ok too understand that good friendships are essential friends can range from someone you just hang out with to have fun to someone you confide in when you re having trouble or ask for advice when you need it true friends are an important part of life because they help you learn more about yourself help you make good choices and help you connect with others true friends tell each other the truth and keep each other s best interests in mind you can know if someone is not really your friend if they lie to please you or to trick you or if they undermine your efforts or don t care about your successes friendships can take a lot of work to maintain try to make time every week to call or visit your friends just to stay caught up with their lives and let them know you re thinking about them understand that romantic relationships can be complex like friendships romantic relationships can vary from casual to more intimate depending on how well you know one another and how committed you are to one another in other words what expectations you have of each other some people enjoy dating casually and spending a lot of time with lots of different people perhaps even becoming sexually intimate with lots of casual partners this has the advantage of allowing you to find out what traits you like in a romantic partner and it gives you a chance to develop your communication and other relationship skills without the pressure of commitment other people prefer to become very emotionally attached and committed to just one person eventually most people hope to find someone they can commit to in a long term relationship or marriage learn about work relationships these are the people whom you see every day but are not necessarily close to these relationships can be very important to your success if you build good relationships with the people you work with or the people you re in school with you can show that you are a team player try to treat everyone you work with with respect and kindness even if they are not someone you would want to be friends with on a social basis your coworkers all have different life experiences that can be helpful in the workplace so look for everyone s strengths sometimes work relationships overlap with romantic or friend relationships which can often be confusing and in the case of romantic relationships may sometimes be against your workplace rules remember to stay professional whenever you are at work and treat everyone the same familiarize yourself with romantic relationships whether it be dating or marriage relationships like these can be complicated and hard to understand romantic relationships give people a chance to open their hearts to someone else and connect on a very intimate level this person will see the good and bad sides of you and love you anyway communication is key to keeping a romantic relationship healthy and happy because of the intimacy of romantic relationships they can cause a lot of pain and heartache from misunderstandings hurt feelings and disappointment choose carefully who you open your heart to but you also have to be willing to take some risks in the name of love otherwise you might miss out on a great relationship look for quality in any relationship depth and sincerity should be most important have a few good solid and rewarding relationships rather than focusing on too many people who slip in and out of your life as they please,Relationships

you re in the middle of a great chat or having a good laugh together test the waters by quickly and lightly touching her on the forearm how does she react if she flinches or withdraws suddenly trying to put your arm around her is a bad idea 4 x research source however if she meets your eyes smiles or moves in closer to you when you touch her forearm go for it by touching her forearm first you are

seems like a stretch because of distance move a little closer to her and see how she reacts go on a friday or saturday night most dates happen at night so opt for an evening showing over a matinee

date 7 x research source if she agrees to go to a movie on a friday or saturday night with you it s a good sign that she definitely likes you as more than a friend her presence alone should boost your

closeness 8 x research source make sure she likes horror movies before you bring her to one you want the experience to be fun for her not literally terrifying make sure the seating will accommodate your move once the two of you sit down in the theater check out the seating situation are the seats close enough together are they comfortable if you shift your weight around do the seats make any weird or awkward sounds is there an armrest between your seats and if so will it get in your way these are all things to consider if any of the above mentioned scenarios seem like they might get in your way or create an awkward moment wait for a better time if your shoulders are touching when you sit in your seats you ll be able to pull the move off seamlessly choose the right moment the best time to make your move is during a romantic scene or a scary scene during which she might appreciate a little comfort avoid trying to put your arm around her a during sex scene since that could be very awkward and send her the wrong message another bad time to try is during a pivotal scene or a climactic one since your move might be more of a distraction to her than a romantic gesture if she s engrossed in the film don t worry too much about the timing and end up not doing it 9 x expert source eddy baller dating coach expert interview 7 february 2020 be calm and casual you will probably be

sweet discussion with her and since you ll already be walking side by side it s a perfect scenario for you to put your arm around her avoid discussing anything heavy or negative walk slowly and keep your body language relaxed 11 x research source suggest taking a stroll with her at a nearby park on a pretty afternoon another good excuse for a walk is to go window shopping or run an errand be near her wherever you happen to be hanging out or whatever you might be doing always try to sit or stand close to her when it makes sense to do so obviously don t follow her into the bathroom or anything like that but in general staying by her side creates a couple atmosphere and provides ample opportunities to get your arm around her if she seems uncomfortable with your nearness or makes excuses to get away give it a rest you want her to feel liked not stalked offer her your jacket if she looks cold or if you happen to be out together on a windy or overcast day be a gentleman and offer her your jacket not only will she think you re romantic but putting your jacket over her shoulders provides an excellent opportunity to sneak your arm around her place the jacket sweetly around her shoulders and then let your arm remain naturally around them smile at her and give her shoulder a little squeeze after you re got your arm around her she ll most likely look up at you when you do this and you two will share a real moment of closeness use the classic stretch and yawn move if all else fails give this classic a try yawn a bit and naturally lift your arms up in a stretch being as casual as you can when you bring your arms down put one of them around her shoulders if this feels a little obvious you can always overact the move in a very obvious cheesy way this will probably make her laugh and you should too sharing a laugh will break the ice and create a sense of comfort and ease between the two of you and you ll have your arm snugly around her,Relationships
how to treat girls with respect,in our society women and girls are often treated with disrespect this is due in part to men and boys not fully understanding how to show them the respect they deserve any time you interact with people including girls you should strive to be as respectful as possible learn to respect the bodies emotions and opinions of girls and to speak to them in a way that shows you care about their thoughts and feelings,make eye contact when talking when you speak to someone you make eye contact with them this shows that you are listening attentively and that you are focused on the conversation this rule applies for girls as much as it does for boys by making eye contact with her you show her that you respect her 1 x research source this doesn t mean that you should stare unblinkingly into her eyes you can allow your gaze to shift about but try to stay focused on her eyes as much as possible allow her to speak listen to what girls have to say and avoid dominating the conversation conversation between two people is give and take after you say something give her a chance to respond when she is saying something wait until she finishes speaking to respond if you are truly listening your response will be relevant to what she has said and add substance to the conversation try to practice active listening such as by 2 x research source using neutral statements to show you are paying attention such as yes i see and uh huh asking probing questions to keep her talking such as what happened next how did that make you feel and what are you going to do now restating to ensure you understood what she said such as by saying it sounds like you are saying ____ is that right assess your attitude towards girls basically every culture has some version of the golden rule that basically says treat others as you would like to be treated well this is applies to girls as well using degrading and disrespectful slurs anything from calling her a gold digger to implying that boys are smarter than girls is not an appropriate way to talk to or about girls take some time to reflect on your attitude towards girls to help you determine what your biases might be for example do you tend to associate women with certain careers behaviors or social roles are you skeptical of women in positions of power make a list of things that you consider your biases against women 3 x research source do not allow this behavior from other people if a friend is being disrespectful towards girls point it out and correct them 4 x research source mind your manners avoid obsessive swearing passing gas burping etc while it s best practice to avoid this things around any person girls tend to be less amused by these behaviors than boys accidents happen for example a burp slips out after dinner and that s okay say excuse me and move on 5 x research source try to practice good manners such as by saying please and thank you paying attention during conversations offering help and opening doors the point is to avoid being deliberately rude not to be a robot ask for permission before touching another person this rule applies to everyone there are no exceptions to who does and does not have the right to give or withhold consent for physical contact that said girls bodies are more notoriously objectified show her respect by acknowledging her right to decide who touches her body and when and how they do it 6 x research source note that this does not extend to allowing anyone to decide that you have to touch them you also have the right to say no if you are not comfortable with the contact understand that no does mean no society often seems disconnected from the concept of consent most people understand that if consent is not given then you should not touch or continue to touch a girl somehow though many of these same people also believe that the validity of a girl s objection to being touched is dependent on a host of other factors e g how she is dressed how much she likes you etc this is not true no means no period 7 x research source this is not limited to romantic situations the rule extends to any physical contact be mindful of comments that affect her body image you should not compare a girl s body to other girls bodies this can be seen as a direct insult to either or both of the girls you are comparing even if you are not talking about the girl who s listening saying things about other girls bodies can imply that you are talking about her body as well 8 x research source it is okay to compliment a girl on her looks but do it respectfully i think you are beautiful is much more respectful than saying you re hot rather than complimenting a girl on an aspect she can t change like her eyes compliment her on something she has control over like her rad shoes know when to leave a girl alone sometimes a girl might not want your attention in these cases you should respect her wishes and leave her alone if she tells you that she would rather be left alone it is disrespectful to continue to talk to her compliment her or otherwise pursue her attention if a girl indicates that she wants to be left alone then you can just say something like sorry i ll leave or okay have a good day and then leave avoid generalizing all girls into the same categories each girl is different and has different needs than other girls it can often be insulting to a girl to assume that she likes certain things just because she s a girl this implies that all girls are basically the same which is not true you have to understand that every girl has her own unique personality before you will be able to respect her needs and opinions think about the assumptions you make regarding girls and work to overcome them 9 x research source if a girl s needs are unclear to you ask her what she needs acknowledge that her emotions are valid you will not always understand the emotions of another person this often comes to light when boys and girls struggle to understand each other s perspectives and feelings even if she doesn t feel the way you think she should or you don t understand how she came to feel the way she does you have to acknowledge that it is how she feels her feelings are valid and do not need to meet your criteria to be important 10 x research source ask her things like how does this make you feel when she answers listen and don t disregard her feelings by saying something like well that doesn t make any sense show empathy and provide emotional validation for example you can say something like it sounds like you had a tough day it must ve felt awful to sit through that meeting class attempt to meet her needs first of all when showing a girl respect understand that she is her own person in charge of her own happiness her happiness is not in your hands that said when a girl decides to trust you or lean on you try your best to meet her needs be supportive in tough situations and encourage her every day 11 x research source again you can always ask her what she needs if you are unsure recognize her opinion as equal to yours if you are debating with facts and figures then those things speak for themselves when it comes to matters of personal opinion you absolutely must acknowledge that a girl s opinion is as valid as your own the fact that she is a girl does not make her any less intelligent or able to form a coherent opinion you are allowed to disagree with her but you also have to respect her point of view 12 x research source present valid arguments if you disagree with a girl stick to the facts dismissing her opinion by saying something like well of course you think that you re a girl is completely disrespectful if you have a reason to disagree with her state that reason with facts or as your own opinion but do not belittle her for being a girl 13 x research source for example if you think that a lamborghini is superior to a ferrari and she disagrees present the stats for each car don t say something like this just goes to show girls know nothing about cars ask her opinion regularly if you respect someone you value their opinion ask a girl for her opinion on things regularly to show that you care what she thinks you can agree or disagree but you should show genuine interest and consideration in her point of view 14 x research source for example you might ask you should ask her where she wants to go on a friday night rather than assume that she ll want to do whatever you decide,Relationships
how to be caring,being caring allows you to have empathy for others and to live a life based on affection love and compassion for the people around you it can be tempting to fall into a life of selfishness and to focus only on your own goals and desires but your days will be far more rewarding if you think about what the people in your life are thinking and feeling being caring means providing a listening ear noticing when someone needs help and helping your community without asking for a reward if you want to know how to be more caring today see step 1 to get started,be sensitive to the feelings of others if you want to have a more caring perspective then you have to spend more time thinking about how other people are feeling be on the lookout to see how the people around you are reacting to a given situation or just how they re feeling when they walk in the door people who are caring are attuned to the moods of others and can tell when someone is feeling down or upset and take measures to do something about it the next time you are around other people whether you re in class or hanging out with friends pay attention to how they are feeling in a given situation people who are self absorbed or who only care about themselves tend not to care when other people around them are upset even if they caused it make sure this isn t you even if you re not the one causing the hurt feelings be aware of how others around you are reacting to a given comment or a piece of news if you re in a meeting and notice that many people are visibly upset when your boss explains the objectives for a new project you may want to talk to your boss about it think about how your actions affect other people you may be too busy trying to further your own needs to always think about the impact that a certain thing you do or say can have on a person the next time you do something whether it s leaving the kitchen for your roommate to clean up because you re having a busy day or ignoring your best friend s phone call about her breakup ask yourself how this person would react to whatever it is you did if the answer is not well then you should think about changing your actions to something that would better suit people of course this doesn t mean that people always have to like or agree with everything you do sometimes you have to do what you believe in without trying to pander to others but if your behavior is selfish rude or unpleasant then you have to start thinking about making a change pick your battles caring people tend to focus on maintaining positive healthy relationships sometimes this means having arguments or engaging with conflicts with others in order to resolve an issue however if you want to be caring you can think more about cutting people some slack and about maintaining positive healthy relationships instead of fighting all the time the next time you begin an argument or conflict with someone ask yourself if it s really worth having or if you just want to get some anger off your chest if you don t think an argument or confrontation can lead to anything productive then you re better off skipping it 1 x research source caring people do voice their concerns when they are having a problem in a relationship or situation but they tend to focus on keeping things positive instead of fighting if they can avoid it appreciate the people in your life if you want to be a more caring person then you have to appreciate the people in your life as much as you can be thankful and grateful for your family members your friends your significant other or any of the people who make your life more meaningful and positive don t focus on the things that you re missing or the rude comments you have to deal with sometimes and think about all of the joy and happiness that people bring to your life instead this will not only put you in a better frame of mind but it will make it easier for you to care about the people around you more in order to really appreciate the people in your life you have to thank them as much as you can thank them for helping you out during a hard time for doing you favors or just for being amazing let them know that their presence really does matter in your life don t underestimate the power of a written thank you card these cards aren t as common as they used to be which will make the person who receives them feel all the more special push away feelings of selfishness though it s hard to decide to stop being completely selfish one day anyone can work on being less selfish in his or her daily interactions and everyday life if you want to be less selfish then you have to spend more time thinking about how others are feeling instead of always worrying about me me me the next time you have an interaction with someone focus on how the person is feeling and what he s been up to instead of talking about yourself or only thinking about your own needs the more aware you are about not being selfish the easier it will be to truly care for others remember that there s a difference between being selfish and in taking good care of yourself and not neglecting your own needs for the sake of what others want pay attention people who are caring enter their daily lives with an attentive perspective they pay attention to what people do when they are talking to them and they are sensitive to their needs and feelings paying attention to people s facial expressions gestures dress and even their offhand comments can help paint a complete picture of how that person is really thinking and feeling and can lead you to be more caring your friend may be telling you that she s totally over her breakup but if you look closely you ll see bags under her eyes or a puffy nose that indicate otherwise your roommate may have a big exam coming up and you may notice that she hasn t had a solid meal in two days cooking extra food for dinner can make a big difference in her life and will show that you care be polite you may not think that being polite has much to do with being caring but in fact being polite will make you a more caring person who is determined to treat the people around him or her with respect being polite means having good manners not being overly vulgar or rude in front of people holding doors for people and asking people about their day it also means smiling at people having common courtesy and not getting in another person s way whether you re at the office walking down the street or talking to your sister you should have a goal of being as polite as possible you don t have to be overly formal to be polite you just have to be considerate of other people and make them feel comfortable in your presence be affectionate people who are caring give affection to the people they love or care about whether you re cuddling with your son or holding your girlfriend s hand it s important to give people affection as a way of showing that you care hugs can be very powerful and can bring comfort to people in need you shouldn t go around giving physical affection to the people you don t know well but you should give hugs light touches kisses affectionate pats or other signs of physical love to the people close to you actions really can speak louder than words sometimes though telling a person you care can make a big difference sometimes giving that person a hug or putting your arm around him or her can have that extra impact listen to people people who are caring take the time to listen to others they don t spend all day talking about themselves because they are genuinely interested in what other people have to say when someone is talking to you make eye contact put away your phone or other distractions and don t interrupt the person if you have advice or a comment wait until the person is done talking as you listen pay attention to more than just the words watch the person s face and gestures to get the best understanding of how that person is really thinking and feeling when the person is done talking don t just compare his or her experiences to your own or say i know exactly how you feel don t make this about you look at the situation on the person s terms pay attention to the details if a person is telling you something important don t just forget about it once the conversation is over ask about it later you don t have to say uh huh or to nod too aggressively when the person is talking to show that you are really listening strong eye contact will do a lot of that work for you be more generous being generous whether it s with your time or your money can go a long way in being a more caring person if you want to be caring then you have to give to others and to not be selfish with what you do have we all have busy schedules but it s important to make the time to donate your things do favors for people in need or just to compliment a person close to you be giving in all senses of the word without forgetting about yourself and you ll be on your way to being a more caring person being generous with your time is very important though you don t want to sacrifice all of your me time for the sake of someone else make a habit of taking the time to listen to a friend or loved one in need treat others like you want to be treated this may sound very obvious but you d be surprised by how few people actually live by this law if you want to be more caring then you have to be kind and thoughtful toward others and think of how you would feel if you were in their shoes you may not care much when you make a rude comment to your waiter because you re cranky but think about how the comment would make him feel you may not care about being rude to your little brother but you should think about how your words really affect him making a habit of putting yourself in someone else s shoes can make a big difference in how you see the world you may not be down on your luck but someone else may be try to imagine what that s like before you re brusque or uncaring to someone who is less fortunate than you be considerate of others being considerate is another major aspect of being caring if you want to be considerate then you have to respect the people around you and to avoid making a nuisance of yourself this includes not talking too loudly on the phone on a crowded bus not minding your own personal space and not asking your sister how she feels about you inviting her ex boyfriend to your party when she ll be there look out for other people and make sure they feel comfortable and respected in your orbit being considerate also includes asking people questions to make sure they re okay don t turn up the thermostat in your office before asking if everyone else is as freezing as you are you should remember that your words as well as when you say them are also an important aspect of being considerate if you have some negative feedback for a friend or coworker make sure your language is inoffensive and that you bring it up at the right time help people in need helping people in need is a major aspect of being caring you can t be a caring person if you re only out to help yourself helping other people means helping both the friends and family members who need help in their lives and also helping out the less fortunate people in your community or even people you may not know that well who need assistance be on the lookout for people who need help and find a productive way to get involved if you want to be more caring your friends and family members may not always admit it when they need your help however it s up to you to notice when they are just being polite and really need some extra help whether they want you to do some more chores or to run some errands get involved in a soup kitchen literacy center local library teen help program or another program in your area that allows you to make other people s lives more full ask people about their lives another way to be caring is to put more effort into learning about how other people are doing the next time you talk to someone whether it s your neighbor or your best friend ask him or her how he or she is feeling about what he or she has going on that weekend or about how his or her day is going making the effort to ask the little questions can add up to showing that you really do care don t just ask out of obligation but because you genuinely want to know how the person is doing have a balance of talking about yourself and about the other person in any conversation you don t want to ask a million questions and not reveal anything about yourself but you also don t want to talk about yourself and not learn anything about the other person either remember that this doesn t mean you have to pry asking something innocent like how the person s dogs are doing or if he or she has any fun summer plans can make the person see that you care without you coming on too strong apologize when you need to caring people care about how their actions affect other people therefore they are quick to apologize when they ve done something wrong they don t deny their mistakes and they are comfortable admitting they re not perfect if you know you ve hurt somebody then you have to swallow your pride and say something as simple as i m so sorry i hurt your feelings i really regret what i did to show that you re aware of how your actions impact others doing this shows that you do care because you think about how others are feeling 2 x research source when you apologize make eye contact and avoid other distractions show the person that he or she is worth your time don t say i m sorry you felt hurt when i made that comment because this is an empty apology that will only do more damage do favors for people caring people spend time doing favors for people and helping them out when they need it this doesn t mean you have to become someone s errand boy but it does mean that you should make an effort to help people out whether you re picking up coffee for your boyfriend giving your little brother a ride to school or helping your best friend pick out the flowers for her wedding while there should be a balance and the person should do favors for you also if he or she is capable of it you should make a habit of doing favors for those you care about though you don t have to spread yourself too thin sometimes the greatest joy can come from doing a favor for someone you don t know that well if you shovel your neighbor s driveway while you re shoveling yours after a snowstorm the effort will be much appreciated be on the lookout people won t always ask you if they need a favor sometimes you should just be able to tell when they really need your help but don t want to impose share sharing really is caring if you want to be a more caring person then you should be willing to share your things this means sharing things you actually care about like clothes you like or half of your favorite sandwich not sharing something that means nothing to you like a book you didn t like much anyway be on the lookout for opportunities to share things whether it s a material object or a piece of advice people who are caring are unselfish and sharing is a key trait of a person who is selfless 3 x research source sharing doesn t only mean material goods you can also share knowledge take the time to talk to a high school student about the college admissions process if you re in college talk to someone starting out in your career field about your experiences help a younger person on your tennis team master her forehand look for opportunities to improve a person s life by sharing what you know check in with people another way to be caring is to let people know that you re thinking about them even when you re not together to do this you should check in with your friends or family members whether it s through sending a text message after your best friend s exam or calling your cousin on her birthday sending cards also gets the message across though people are busy and it s unrealistic to talk to multiple friends every day make a habit of checking in on at least one friend a week will make a big difference it s one thing to care about someone when he or she is standing right in front of you but it s another to check in on that person when he or she is out of sight if you know a friend is having a hard time you should check in on your friend even if you re just saying hi you don t have to keep saying how are you feeling or that might get annoying but emailing an interesting article or sending your friend a funny text can help cheer him or her up remember the details about people s lives another way to show that you really care is to pay attention to the details that people tell you this could mean the name of your co worker s cat the time when your mom is waiting to hear if she gets a promotion or the fact that your new friend grew up in topeka kansas hold on to these details and bring them up later to show that you care if you keep forgetting every little thing a person tells you then it ll start to look like you don t care very much make a point of remembering as much as you can about a person s life and to follow up about it when it matters of course you don t have to remember every little thing but if you focus on the important details you ll have a better sense of who the person is and what matters to him or her volunteer volunteering is a major way to be more caring you can volunteer in your community to help out people in need and you can also find other ways to help out volunteer at a local bookstore or library volunteer to help clean up a park in your community volunteer to bake something for your school s bake sale be on the lookout for more opportunities to improve your community and to make a difference in the place where you live 4 x research source you can also volunteer in a different city or even a different country spend your spring break building houses for habitat for humanity in a different part of your state or even working to help out in a different country you ll become more caring by spending more time focusing on improving other people s lives,Relationships
how to react after saying i love you,saying i love you is a big step in a relationship so it s important to take it seriously if someone says it to you think about how you feel about the person and ask yourself if you love them too if you do then you might want to tell them that so they know you re on the same page however if you don t then it s important to be honest with them while also respecting their feelings,reflect on your feelings for the person consider if you love them if you just enjoy spending time with them or if you even see a future with the person at all saying i love you is a milestone in a relationship that indicates the person has strong feelings for you they ll want to know if you reciprocate those feelings if you don t then it s important to be aware of that and decide how you ll move forward from there 1 x research source for example if you really like the person but you re not sure if you love them you might want to continue the relationship and see if those feelings develop over time however if you have started to feel like your relationship with this person isn t working then it might be time to let them know this so that you can both move on say i love you back to the person only if you mean it if you love the person and feel ready to tell them that then now is a great time to say i love you too however it s important to be honest if you re not ready to say i love you even if you develop feelings of love for the person eventually saying it before you mean it is dishonest and it could lead to problems down the road 2 x research source never say i love you back if you don t mean it because this will introduce a lie into your relationship give a direct response to let them know if you re not ready if you don t feel ready to say i love you it s fine to respond in a simple straightforward manner listen to your instincts if you re not ready to say it back and be totally honest with the person just make sure to be polite and considerate of their feelings 4 x research source try saying something like sorry i m just not ready to say that yet or i m glad to know you feel that way i m not there yet but i want to keep our momentum going tell them you value them if you re not ready to say i love you one way to respond to someone who has just said i love you is to focus on their positive traits and let them know that you value these things about them think about what you like about the person and what makes you want to spend time with them then focus on these things in your response 5 x research source try saying something like i m so happy you feel that way i enjoy spending time with you too you re such a wonderful listener or you might say i care about you too you re kind smart funny and i just love spending time with you give them a hug or a kiss if you want to providing a token of affection for the person is another great way to respond you hug or kiss the person instead of responding with words you can also add a hug or kiss if you said i love you back or if you told them you don t feel ready to say i love you yet just don t hug or kiss the person if you are thinking of breaking up with them this will send mixed signals which can cause the person distress once they learn the truth 6 x research source for example if you ve just said i love you too then lean in for a hug or a kiss if you ve just told the person that you re not ready to say i love you yet and let them know that you value them and enjoy their company you might offer a hug as a way to show you re sincere if you ve just told the person that you are not interested in continuing the relationship then giving a hug or a kiss is not a good idea however you might reassure them with a less intimate physical gesture such as a pat on the arm or back expect some disappointment if you don t say i love you the person may look disappointed or even embarrassed after saying i love you if you don t reciprocate this is normal it s fine to show empathy for them but don t feel pressured to say i love you or feel guilty for being honest about your feelings allow them a moment to sit with their feelings before you respond 7 x research source you might even offer to let them have some privacy if they seem very sad or embarrassed try saying something like i m sorry if that came as a shock if you need a minute to yourself i can leave and we can talk again later watch for extreme reactions like anger it s normal for someone to feel sad or disappointed and even embarrassed if you don t reciprocate their feelings but it s not normal for them to respond with anger or rage if the person starts yelling storms out throws or breaks something or becomes physically aggressive towards you leave immediately and stay away from them these kinds of reactions are all red flags that the person may become abusive towards you 8 x research source call emergency services if the person becomes violent or aggressive towards you and you are alone with them accept that everyone moves at their own pace within a relationship even if your significant other is declaring their love for you already this does not mean that you have to do the same for the relationship to continue you might need more time and that is perfectly fine it s normal for people to move at different paces in a relationship take your time and don t say i love you until or unless you are actually ready 9 x research source for example your significant other might be ready to say i love you after only 3 months of dating while you might need 4 months or longer to develop those feelings be aware that there is a possibility that you will never feel the same way about them as they feel about you honor your true feelings and do not continue the relationship if this is the case do something fun to commemorate the moment if you responded positively after the person says i love you it might be a good idea to do something enjoyable to commemorate the moment go for a walk together watch a romantic movie or do something else that you both enjoy however if you did not reciprocate and you don t expect to continue the relationship you might want to do just the opposite and spend some time on your own if you want to commemorate the moment try saying something like let s go do something fun are you up for a movie or if you need some time to yourself try saying something like sorry but i have to go let s talk again tomorrow okay,Relationships

how to ignore someone who hurt you,when someone says or does something that hurts you you may feel angry sad embarrassed or even scared while it may be tempting to lash out in return sometimes the best thing you can do is put on a calm face and ignore the hurtful behavior after the hurtful event give yourself some time to feel upset understanding where the other person was coming from and owning your feelings about what happened can also help you start to move on,stay calm if another person is intentionally trying to hurt or upset you it s important not to give them what they want on the other hand if they re not being intentionally hurtful reacting with anger can escalate the situation unnecessarily even if you re furious sad or scared do your best to appear calm and collected 1

only make the situation worse instead of blurting out the first thing that comes into your head in the heat of the moment stop and think about whether what you want to say is necessary true or helpful if not don t say it resist the urge to yell cry or insult the other person try gently biting your tongue or putting your finger to your lips if you feel tempted to snap back or speak before you think if do you want to respond but you need time to calm down and choose your words first try saying excuse me i need a moment step out of the room so you can calm down 3 x research source walk away if the

won t respond to the hurtful behavior anymore make sure to follow through on the consequences you set sometimes it s helpful to offer an alternative to the hurtful behavior that way you can ignore the bad behavior but reinforce the better alternative 6 x research source for example say something like i m not going to have a conversation with you if you laugh at me or insult me we can talk when you re ready to be respectful and really listen to what i have to say get away and find help if you feel like you re in danger if you feel physically threatened don t try to confront the person get away

include the other members of her group in the conversation so they won t be left out however make sure you are still fun of the conversation so that you are also getting a chance to talk to the girl while having fun most girls think it s nice when guys are nice to their friends disengage if it doesn t work sometimes the best tactic is to chat for a while and then move elsewhere keep making eye contact with the girl you were trying to talk to this can be a great way of seeing if she s interested in talking more with you if she leaves the group and goes to find you good sign if you never meet back up wait unit the end of the night when her group is leaving pull her aside quickly and tell her what a great time you ve had tell her you d love to meet her for coffee or a drink sometime ask more questions than you talk what is this group interested in what do they like are are they like if this group could be a kind of dessert what would she be just find fun and light things to chat about to see what she and the rest of the group are interested in here are some good group questions if you re not familiar with the group how do you all know each other how often do you all hang out

to other people 5 x expert source laura bilotta dating coach matchmaker expert interview 7 july 2020 listen to what they re talking about and respond to the subject positively and kindly with something of your own if the group is taking about a movie ask what everyone thought if someone says boring say oh really what movies do you like keep the conversation flowing and positive to show that you re an interesting person that this girl should want to talk to the follow up is the most important part of a conversation nobody knows how to talk to a stranger without listening to what they say and responding 6 x research source keep turning the attention of the group to the girl you want to talk to if one member of the group is giving her opinion about a particular topic turn to the girl you want to talk to and say what do you think this is an excellent way of contributing to the break in the conversation and including her in it as well it also signals to everyone that you re interested in talking to her specifically look for something you have in common if you know she s in a particular club likes a certain band or is particularity interested in something focus your conversation by asking her about it ask how long she s been interested in that hobby why she likes it and let it lead to finding out more about her and seeing what you guys have in common tell her about yourself conversation is give and take and if you only talk about her she might feel like you re prying be open about your life experiences to help her feel more comfortable 7 x expert source laura bilotta dating coach matchmaker expert interview 7 july 2020 after asking her about herself think about something that has to do with what she says and then respond 8 x research source at the

to a group try to keep things light and positive encourage others in their opinions and laugh at their jokes don t interrupt anyone or dissent from the group at first until you re sure of the dynamics lots of pick up artist schemes recommend subtle insults as a way of getting a girl to be attracted while this has mixed results it s always a terrible idea to try in a group full of girls little jokes can work fine but there s a difference between saying something teasing and flirty like i can t believe you hated iron man have you no soul prove to me you have a soul and telling a girl that her perspective on birth control is childish be yourself 10 x research source don t try to make yourself into someone else to get her attention or pretend to be interested into things you don t like if you end up not having much in common that s okay go look for other groups and other conversations forget about lines start by introducing yourself and shaking her hand than everyone else s hand ask if you can sit down with them talk to everyone equally and be genuinely interested in what they are saying that s how a conversation should get started with a group not with are those space pants don t try to show off as part of a group jokes and gimmicks are more likely to get you a drink in the face than an invitation to coffee,Relationships
how to fight for a relationship,relationships are hard it s a challenge to manage two people s different personalities wants and needs and even the best of us go through rough patches or breakdowns but these relationships are usually worth the effort worth fighting for to fight for a relationship you ll need to reach out to your estranged partner come to terms with the past and ultimately accept that person for who they are,apologize if need be relationships strain when one or both partners feel hurt whether because of a fight careless words or long term resentments all relationships go through this to some extent the important thing is to reach out and apologize when you ve done wrong apologizing shows your commitment to your partner and the relationship 1 x research source 2 x research source to apologize well you have to be sincere specific and recognize the hurt you caused accept your role in having damaged trust or respect in the relationship this doesn t mean accepting all responsibility but owning up to your part be sincere and specific only apologize to make amends and heal damage and not for some other ulterior reason at the same time be specific about what you are apologizing for and how it hurt the other person for example i m very sorry that i stormed off during our argument i can see that it hurt you and made you feel humiliated please forgive me avoid weasel worded apologies these don t really accept any responsibility and come off as insincere i e i m sorry if what i did offended you or i m sorry if you took it the wrong way don t request an apology in return mutual forgiveness is important but your partner may need time to process their feelings asking for an apology will only seem like a demand listen to your partner an apology is only the first part of reaching out it won t fix things but can break the ice and start the healing process don t be surprised if your partner reacts emotionally or even interrupts you resist the urge to interrupt and defend yourself though and instead be patient and respectful and listen 3 x research source try not to react defensively or insist on finishing your side of the story your first urge may be to correct or refute your partner but instead let them speak by showing patience you also let your partner speak openly without fear or reprisal and demonstrate that you re serious about healing the rift keep in mind that the point of an apology is to heal the relationship it is not about proving who was right and who was wrong leave the door open but don t over pursue make it clear to your partner that you want to save the relationship at the same time accept that these things take time resist the urge to pursue your partner especially one who has become distant or you may end up driving them further away allow for some time and space while leaving the door open to reconciliation 4 x research source be clear that you are ready to talk if and when your partner is ready make sure they know you are open to communication at the same time people often want physical and emotional space after an argument or hurt try to recognize and respect this need for distance do not hound your partner seek counseling together or as an individual counseling isn t a sure fire fix but it can help you air and work out problems as well as learn how to communicate more effectively with your partner consider couples counseling if your relationship is in trouble however even going to counseling on your own can be helpful 5 x research source 6 x research source ask your partner to go to counseling with you if you ve been having communications or trust issues if you ve grown distant and are just occupying the same space or if one of you is acting on negative feelings try to find a counselor that you both can work with this may take several tries ask potential counselors questions about their credentials experience and fitness to help you and success rate think of a counselor as a consultant rather than a fixer a counselor will advise you but the most important work will occur outside of your sessions consider finding a counselor or therapist even if your partner refuses to attend be ready to explore your past history to fight for a relationship you ll need to face problems head on and not just paper them over allowing them to fester with a counselor or not be ready to talk deeply about the issues in your relationship this isn t easy it means revisiting old hurts talking about resentments and expressing disappointment 7 x research source 8 x research source be ready to listen to your partner the key to moving forward is to attend and understand past hurt with empathy be willing to express your own frustrations but always do so tactfully resist the urge to blame or justify behaviors in the past and instead look to understand the underlying motives you may see that these were not as malicious as you thought recall what drew you together there was a reason you and your partner ended up together in the first place try to reflect together on why you loved each other and whether it s possible to regain that spark learn to express your feelings constructively putting your feelings out in the open will help you to understand motivations and needs so learning how to talk and even disagree is critical it can help you and your partner reassess assumptions about one another as well as to state your needs clearly and openly 9 x research source 10 x research source if you are having counseling make sure to talk about effective communication with your counselor follow the rules of effective communication and fighting fair for example try to avoid accusatory language start sentences with i think or i feel rather than saying things like you always or you never avoid generalizations as well be specific and stick to the facts and your feelings talk about what you need from your partner not what you think they are failing to give you i e i need but don t feel your support for my career as a businesswoman or try i feel ignored because i want and need more public affection from you instead of you ignore me because you never show affection in public invite the other person s point of view don t interrupt but listen and then try to restate what you ve heard learn to accept your partner to really fight for your relationship you have to be willing to take your partner as a whole person even the habits and behaviors you may dislike or resent this is no small challenge but it s a necessary one if you want to salvage your connection 11 x research source 12 x research source try to see things from the other side say you ve always hated your partner s messiness try to reverse the situation and see their point of view are they really so messy or are you overly concerned with tidiness accept that you don t have control over your partner or your partner s background and raising seeing their incorrect habits as a reflection of upbringing or deeply held priorities and values can help to soften the tension maintain certain boundaries though you are under no obligation at all to accept destructive or abusive behavior let go of feelings of superiority to save a relationship you ll not only have to compromise on small things like habits and behavior but also on the larger feeling that you re in the right this attitude isn t usually helpful it can prevent you from changing the way you see your partner and yourself 13 x research source remind yourself that if one of you is right the other is not necessarily wrong your partner s contrasting opinions don t invalidate yours they are just different for example your notions of etiquette how to act talk and socialize politely might be very different from your partner s but one of these views is not necessarily more correct than the other they are simply different honor and support your partner s needs probably the most important thing in fighting for a relationship is building empathy and the result of accepting your partner s opinions and values should be an effort on your part to try to meet their emotional and physical needs as best you can without compromising yourself 14 x research source be open to compromise so long as your partner s needs don t break with your own values for example say religion is very important to your partner but not to you are you willing to support this part of their life or say you ve squabbled over affection and now realize that your partner expresses affection is different ways than you maybe through gifts or gestures are you willing to learn this language an effort on your part will make your partner feel more valued find out if your ex is still interested sometimes we want to fight for a relationship that has ended or is in the process of ending this is not an uncommon thing in fact as many as 50 of younger adults reportedly reconcile at least once after a breakup try to read the signals to see if your ex is still interested in you 15 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source 16 x research source be subtle your ex may feel badgered if you overdo things so it s best to keep your distance at least at first don t force contact and avoid having friends investigate on your behalf try to glean hints from things like social media from people like mutual friends or from your ex partner if you are still have some contact remember the odds are probably in your favor make contact if you are still interested and have reason to think your ex is too you ll need to reach out try something low key send your ex partner a short message on facebook for example or a short email be brief and do not be overbearing otherwise you may scare them away 17 x research source have a reason for initiating contact for example say something like i was eating ice cream today and it made me think of how much you love chunky monkey how are you doing or i just saw your name on facebook and thought i d say hi i hope you re doing well let your ex s response guide the next move if the reply is curt i e yeah hope you re well too your prospect of a reconciliation might not be good a more effusive response can indicate interest try to arrange a meeting if the response is positive ask to talk over coffee or a drink for example make it clear that you just want a short meeting with no strings attached clear the air know what you want to say beforehand and how you want to say it choose your words carefully because your ex probably still harbors strong feelings for you both good ones and bad say what s on your mind express regret apologize if you need to but be tactful say that you are sorry things didn t work out and want to talk to put the relationship in perspective e g i just wanted to see how you ve been and to talk about what went wrong between us let the discussion guide what you say don t press the issue if your ex is happy and seeing other people but gradually steer the conversation toward reconciliation if they seem to retain strong feelings for you take things slowly if your ex wants to rekindle the relationship there were probably good reasons why things ended issues that you ll need to talk through seriously maybe in counseling be ready to move on if your ex isn t interested in reconnecting at the very least know that you can have final closure on the matter,Relationships
how to get pet custody after a breakup,breakups are difficult enough but when you and your former partner brought a pet into your lives that you both care for who gets the pet can become a serious issue u s law is slowly but surely recognizing the deep bond that many people share with their pets and courts will determine custody arrangements for pets just as they do for children however in most cases it s better for you to try to work out something with your former partner rather than letting someone else make the decision for you 1 x research source 2 x research source,consider the context of the relationship if your relationship with your former partner involved physical or emotional abuse attempting to negotiate pet custody with them directly may not be the best option for you breakups are seldom completely amicable but unless there are abuse problems you should be able to get your former partner to listen to reason however if your former partner was abusive or if you suspect they might hurt your pet call an animal law attorney immediately to learn your options you can find an attorney by doing a general internet search for animal law attorney with the name of your city or state you also may be able to find names through your state or local bar association s online directory in some cases animal law attorneys have been successful with getting restraining orders that include pets if you re concerned for the safety of your pet as well as yourself talk to a family law attorney who has experience with restraining orders you also can seek help from a local domestic violence shelter schedule a private meeting ideally you want to talk about pet custody in a private environment where the two of you can talk about the issues involved with a minimum of distractions 3 x research source you may want to choose a neutral location such as a local café or restaurant go for a time when you are both available but try not to make it late at night or on a weekend when the place will be packed let them know what you want to talk about when you schedule the meeting if they try to insult or demean you for making such a big deal over it simply tell them that it means a lot to you and you d appreciate it if they would give you the benefit of the doubt and take you seriously when you call to schedule the meeting try to keep your conversation civil you want to meet and discuss the issue but there s no need to get in a fight about it over the phone do not relinquish possession of your pet according to state law pets are considered property this means that with pet custody as with determining ownership of other items of personal property the law favors the person in possession 4 x research source you may have heard the phrase possession is nine tenths of the law this phrase is true in most cases and applies to the issue of pet custody if your former partner already has taken your pet with them coming to an agreement together may be the best chance you have of getting your pet back if you end up having to take them to court and they already have possession of the animal chances are the court will end up awarding custody to them take written notes to use as guidance there are a lot of issues wrapped up in pet care including food activities and veterinary care assuming that both of you love the pet and want what s best for the animal you want to go over all of these aspects at your meeting with your former spouse 5 x research source create an outline of your history with your pet starting from the beginning this can help you create arguments for why you should get pet custody after the breakup for example suppose you are the one who initially adopted the pet your former partner was reluctant at first and wanted nothing to do with it but eventually came around and grew to love the animal in that case the fact that you originally adopted the animal works in your favor it also helps if you are typically the one to take your pet to the vet or the groomer and buy its food money can be difficult if you and your former partner had a joint bank account in that case think about who provided most of the care and attention you also may want to think about which of you the animal is more attached to although typically that will be the person who most often feeds and cares for the pet use an objective rational approach it can be difficult to hold back your emotions if you re particularly attached to your pet but try to do your best to look at the situation objectively and determine which of you is best suited to take care of the animal 6 x research source 7 x research source regardless of your feelings if your former partner would take better care of your pet than you would be able to you may want to let them have custody just make sure it s understood that you want to be able to come and visit your pet for example to visit once a week and take the dog for a walk in the park on the other hand if you have the time and money to adequately support your pet use the reasons you wrote in your outline to explain to your former partner why you want custody of your pet avoid insulting your former partner breakups rarely happen for no reason tensions are bound to be high anyway but the last thing you want to do is turn your pet custody meeting into a shouting match 8 x research source try to keep in mind that you are there because you both love and care for your pet if your former partner didn t care about the animal they probably would have let you have it with no problem if you find yourself getting angry or frustrated turn your attention back to your pet keep your pet s face in your mind and remember what you re doing this for it also can help to remind your former partner if things start to get heated that you re both there for your pet not for each other make an effort to listen assume that your former partner genuinely cares about your pet and its well being they may have serious concerns about your ability to provide adequate care for the animal 9 x research source you can only learn these concerns by keeping an open mind and listening carefully try to ask your former partner questions if necessary to draw out their reasons for not wanting to give you custody of your pet by listening to your former partner s concerns you may be able to find a solution that makes both of you happy and puts your pet in as good a position as it was before the breakup for example suppose your former partner is concerned you won t have time to take the dog for a walk during the day because you have a 30 minute commute to work and are gone all day in that situation you may be able to work out an arrangement in which you allow your former partner to come over during the day to walk the dog in exchange you could pay them a small amount which could potentially save you from having to hire a stranger to walk your dog put any agreement in writing when you sit down and discuss the situation rationally hopefully you and your former partner are able to come to an agreement regarding custody of your pet if you do draw up a written agreement that both of you can sign 10 x research source 11 x research source a signed written agreement is legally binding but it s not necessary to stress that point nor do you need to hire a lawyer or draft a complex contract with lots of legalese a simple agreement that outlines what you ve decided is fine include everything you ve discussed about your pet s care both of you should sign it then make sure your former partner gets a copy of the signed agreement to avoid any problems later grab someone to witness the signatures or take a photo on your phone of each of you signing the agreement locate a community mediation center most towns and cities have community mediation clinics that offer mediation services for common disputes that people have including pet custody issues 12 x research source 13 x research source to find a community mediation center near you do a search on the internet or call the county court clerk s office particularly if you live in a larger city you may find several different service centers look at their websites or call for more information to find the one you like the best you also may be able to get a recommendation by calling a local animal law attorney they may have a particular mediation clinic that they prefer most community clinics are relatively affordable you can expect a single mediation session to cost a few hundred dollars although many have sliding fee scales to assist lower income individuals discuss mediation with your former partner since mediation is a voluntary process you can t force your former partner to participate if they aren t interested however you can tell them about it and do your best to convince them it s the easiest way to resolve the dispute 14 x research source the mediation center you ve chosen may have a pamphlet that explains their process and services in a straightforward way emphasize to your former partner that with mediation a neutral third party will work with the two of you to emphasize a mutually agreeable solution they will not pressure you to come to an agreement and if you don t reach an agreement you can walk away another benefit of mediation is that any agreement you reach is confidential this may be helpful if your former partner is concerned about how it will look to be arguing about pet custody in a public forum such as a courtroom prepare for your session if you already attempted to resolve the dispute with your former partner in person you may have notes from that attempt that you can use to frame the points you want to bring up in mediation 15 x research source a previous attempt also can help you isolate the issues about pet custody that are particularly contentious it can help the mediator if you can figure out where there is significant disagreement as opposed to more minor issues on which you could both find common ground take some time to think about what your goals are for the medication perhaps your ideal outcome is that you have full custody of your pet and your former partner never has anything to do with either of you given the odds of that outcome happening are slim or you wouldn t be at this point try to think of some areas on which you would be willing to compromise you can present those ideas to the mediator arrive for your mediation appointment on the date of your mediation appointment try to get there at least 10 minutes early so you have time to get to the right place and get settled before the session actually starts 16 x research source mediation is not court the session typically will be in an office like setting however try to dress neatly and conservatively you want the mediator to have a good impression of you bring with you any notes or other materials you want to use in your negotiation you also may want to bring a picture of your pet so you can look at it and focus on that during negotiations typically you ll be directed to a private room although you may have to wait in a waiting room if your former partner is not there yet you may meet your mediator but don t expect to engage them in conversation your mediator usually will keep conversation to a minimum so they can remain neutral and assist both of you in finding a mutually agreeable solution to your problem give opening statements once you and your former partner have arrived the mediator typically will provide a brief introduction and explain the basic procedure then they may ask each of you to give a brief opening statement 17 x research source your opening statement doesn t have to be a long involved speech like an opening statement in a courtroom nor should it include a single conclusory statement like i want full custody of my pet this kind of statement is not helpful for mediation come up with two or three points in your favor that you want to emphasize for example you might say i believe i am entitled to full custody of the dog because i brought him home from the pound named him and feed him every day i have taken him to the vet regularly and his registration is in my name this isn t just about factual arguments though if you re short on such points you may be able to point to the unique bond you share with your pet for example you might note that your cat sleeps with you every night and comes running to the door when you come home from work work with the mediator after the initial part of the mediation has concluded the mediator typically will have you and your former partner move to separate rooms so the real work of mediation can begin 18 x research source before moving to separate rooms the mediator may identify particular issues upon which both you and your former partner can agree if you re able to find common ground it sews the seeds for continued agreement and compromise even if the issues you re able to agree on are fairly minor points once you ve separated the mediator will move back and forth between you discussing the situation and trying to find room for compromise sign a written agreement if you and your former partner are able to reach an agreement through mediation the mediator typically will write up an agreement for you both to sign read it over carefully and make sure it reflects everything you ve discussed 19 x research source your custody agreement can cover many different aspects of pet care including not only which of you gets to keep the animal in your home but what kind of food your pet can eat as well as specifying activities or particular veterinary services for example your former partner may be willing to let you have custody of your dog if you agree to take him to his favorite park at least once a week take this agreement seriously even if it includes relatively minor things and understand that once signed it is a legally binding document and can be enforced in a court of law identify the appropriate court if you re thinking about suing your former partner for custody of your pet you need to first figure out what court has jurisdiction over both your former partner and your dispute 20 x research source 21 x research source 22 x research source if you and your former partner were married and are seeking a divorce the issue of who gets the pet will bewared up in your divorce case if you were not married however you ll have to file a lawsuit on your own in most cases small claims courts are equipped to handle a pet custody issue however keep in mind that small claims courts only award monetary damages if you file a lawsuit in small claims you run the risk of winning your case but being awarded the monetary value of your pet rather than the pet itself your county court typically also has jurisdiction over these sorts of claims and can order your former partner to give your pet back to you if they currently have possession of the animal consult an attorney if you intend to pursue custody of your pet in the courts you ll have the best chance of success if you have an experienced animal law attorney on your side even if you have a family law attorney for your divorce an animal law attorney will understand more about the ins and outs of animal law in your state 23 x research source keep in mind that animal law is a relatively new area of law it may be difficult to find an attorney who specializes solely in animal law unless you live in or near a fairly big city however because animal law is relatively new and is rapidly changing it s important to find someone who has experience litigating cases similar to yours your local humane society or other nonprofit groups dedicated to animal rights may be able to connect you with an attorney who can help you file your claim for pet custody after consulting an attorney if you want to sue your former partner for pet custody you should do so as soon as possible you can initiate a lawsuit by filing a complaint with the clerk of the court you ve chosen to hear your case 24 x research source 25 x research source if you re not using an attorney check with the clerk s office or on the court s website for forms you can use to draft your complaint the complaint lists factual allegations which you believe if proven entitle you to custody of your pet keep in mind that this is a legal argument so you must have facts that tend to indicate you are the rightful owner of the animal when you file your lawsuit you ll have to pay a filing fee typically amounting to several hundred dollars if you can t afford this fee ask to apply for a fee waiver if your income and assets are below the court s threshold your court costs will be waived take your complaint forms to the clerk s office along with at least two copies the clerk will stamp all of them filed with the date and assign a date for the next time you have to appear in court they will then give your copies back to you have your former partner served one of the two copies of your court documents is for your own records the other copy must be delivered to your former partner using the correct legal service of process 26 x research source technically you can get anyone over the age of 18 who isn t involved in your lawsuit to hand deliver the documents to your former partner you might choose a trusted friend or relative after service is completed they must sign a proof of service form for you to file with the court you also can hire a sheriff s deputy to hand deliver the court documents to your former partner or mail the documents using certified mail with return receipt requested wait for any response from your former partner when your former partner receives your court documents they have a limited period of time typically only a couple of weeks to file a written response to your lawsuit 27 x research source if your former partner does not respond to your lawsuit you may be eligible to win your case by default however you still must show up on the date your hearing is scheduled if your former partner does file a written response it will be served on you using a process similar to that which you used to serve your former partner it also is likely that your former partner will contact you seeking to come to an agreement rather than go through a trial the other option is that your former partner will decide to fight you every step of the way perhaps even filing a motion to dismiss arguing that you have stated no legal claim to ownership of your pet gather evidence to support your claim lawsuits are won or lost based on the weight of the evidence in your lawsuit you must show that it is more likely than not that you are the rightful owner of your pet and should therefore be granted custody 28 x research source 29 x research source 30 x research source depending on the court in which you filed your lawsuit you may share evidence with your former partner through the discovery process unless your former partner has decided to fight you every step of the way however you shouldn t expect this to be an extensive process evidence that will support your claim for pet custody in court includes things such as proof that you adopted the pet state registration or veterinary records that list only you as the owner and even receipts for pet food and other pet supplies present your case in court when your hearing date arrives you will have the opportunity to tell the judge your story and present your evidence to show that you deserve full custody of your pet if you have an attorney your role in the actual proceedings may be limited but you still should expect to take the stand 31 x research source 32 x research source try to show up at the courthouse at least 30 minutes before your hearing is scheduled but keep in mind that the judge likely will be hearing several cases on the same day once you ve passed through courthouse security take a seat in the courtroom gallery until your case is called then you and your attorney if you have one can move to the front of the courtroom as in any trial you can introduce evidence and even call witnesses if you want to support your arguments for example you may call a friend to testify regarding your relationship with your pet your pet s veterinarian or a veterinary assistant in their office also can be a good witness if you were the only one who ever took your pet to receive veterinary care or treatment listen to your former partner s arguments once you ve presented your side of the story your former partner will have the opportunity to respond just as you did they may introduce evidence or even have witnesses testify on their behalf 33 x research source when your former partner is speaking watch your body language and try to pay attention avoid shouting out or interrupting your former partner even if they interrupted you if your former partner calls any witnesses to testify on their behalf you will have the opportunity to cross examine them through your attorney if you ve hired one pay close attention to their statements and draw on your own knowledge of the person called to question their reliability and the trustworthiness of their statements receive the judge s order after the judge has heard from both sides they will enter an order deciding who gets custody of your pet you may learn the judge s decision immediately after the end of the hearing however it may be a few days before he written order is ready 34 x research source keep in mind that if the judge rules in your favor the court isn t going to enforce the order for you you must do this yourself an attorney can help you determine what you need to do if your former spouse does not immediately comply and deliver your pet to you if you filed your case in small claims court your ability to appeal a decision that wasn t in your favor may be limited in any case if the judge doesn t rule in your favor you have a limited period of time to file an appeal typically 30 days or less talk to an attorney immediately to find out if you have a possible case for appeal,Relationships

how to console someone,when someone is experiencing intense emotional suffering it s hard to know exactly how to go about consoling them it s important to remain calm and positive yourself whether someone has just had an accident has received heartbreaking news or has lost control of their emotions an account of ongoing stress in their lives there are some reliable basic steps to take when seeking to console someone 1 x research source,tell the person that you care there s no right thing to say when someone is in emotional pain especially when there is a perfectly reasonable reason for their suffering choose your words your voice and your manners in terms of what will convey that you care at the simplest level this requires that you act as normally as possible further only say things that are sympathetic non judgmental patient and accepting these will often be simple open ended statement that will encourage the other person to open up another possible thing to say is i m so sorry about ______ don t be worried about mentioning something painful if they are upset they are already thinking about it say things like it s perfectly alright to cry avoid false cheerfulness there will come a time for lighthearted jokes and hopeful statements when someone is feeling deeply distressed or is experiencing intense sorrow any cheeriness may ring hollow worse anything that comes across as insincere may be seem to belittle the gravity of what they are feeling respect how the person is feeling by taking care not to disregard their current emotions 2 x research source avoid statements like look on the bright side or otherwise trying to put a positive spin on something that is obviously giving someone immense pain in sum don t say anything with the sole intention of cheering someone up instead allow someone in emotional distress to release any feelings of despair or anger not repress them focus on conveying the fact that you are simply there for them with statements like you re not alone in this i m right here with you be sensitive to the situation depending on why someone is upset you need to avoid saying things that but may come across as insensitive for instance never say anything along the lines of it was god s will such a statement does absolutely nothing to address how a person is feeling 3 x research source whenever unsure make sure that what you re saying does not minimize or invalidate the suffering that another person is going through sometimes even statements that are true must be avoided for instance you do not want to tell a mother who just miscarried that she could have another child while this may be accurate it ignores her current suffering regarding the loss of her pregnancy open the door for them to do the talking at some point they should talk about how they re feeling you may even have to guide them to do so say something like i know it may hurt to talk about but you should feel free to talk to me about______ now or whenever you want to feel free to do this at any point after they ve calmed down even some time after a traumatic incident 4 x research source avoid equating your own experiences to what someone else is going through don t say i know how you feel even if you have had a similar experience 5 x research source instead say things like i know how much ____ meant to you be honest when you re at a loss for words by saying something along the lines of i don t know you re feeling but i care about you and i want to help you can also say i don t know what to say but i m here for you and i m always willing to listen offer to follow up often people will receive a lot of emotional support immediately following a traumatic incident unfortunately this support will often wane indicate that your support will be ongoing by saying something along the lines of hey can i call you back in a few weeks to see how you re doing 6 x research source do not be concerned that you re bringing up something that someone may not want to talk about if they don t want to they ll say that but chances are they need to either way the knowledge of your continued support will be a source of comfort don t rush to establish the next move someone enduring emotional hardship may struggle to be decisive or may simply not know how to behave or what to do this is an indication of vulnerability and is an entirely natural reaction to distress they may not even want to talk about whatever happened and you shouldn t push them to do so unless someone else s safety or well being depends on it 7 x research source if someone insists they need space give it to them tell them you ll check back with them in a few days let them know they can contact you whenever they wish to do so and that you re there for them whenever they want to spend time together maintain contact don t be incessant but make sure you behave in a way that lets them know you re still thinking about them and that their wellbeing matters to you call or send a card if a week goes by without hearing from them avoid texting emailing or using social media to convey condolences as these communication tools are informal and impersonal 8 x research source don t avoid or ignore someone because you re uncomfortable with what they re going through or don t know how to talk to them if you re uncertain about what to do or say convey your condolences and ask if there is anything you can do accept their silence if they seem to want you around but aren t saying much don t let their silence bother you don t allow your own nervousness to lead you to talk nonstop remind yourself that they may simply want your company feel free to ask questions about how they re feeling or what they re thinking about if they are persistently thinking about whatever happened they likely need to talk about to it release any pent up emotions 9 x research source avoid asking someone how they feel if you run into them at a social function while you should encourage them to talk about how they re feeling do so in an environment where you have privacy and can give them your full attention help with basic needs following a traumatic incident some people will be physically exhausted or depressed they may sleep more than usual and may let struggle to complete everyday chores help out by doing a load of laundry or cleaning the dishes take care not to do everything though as this may impede their recovery or make them feel pitied people need to feel capable of taking care of themselves even when they need a bit of help doing so 10 x research source help them make plans to move forward when the person seems ready ask them what they plan to do don t be surprised if they do not know or are not excited to talk about it provide some potential routes that they might take while offering to help them do so even when making recommendations try to do more listening than talking and only offer actionable advice 11 x research source any suggestions you make should be based on things they ve said themselves asking them who and what they think might help is a good place to start stay alert for any signs of worsening emotional distress if you ever have the inclination that they need professional help encourage them to get it be prepared to do so by having the contact information to relevant people and organizations available assess the situation as you approach someone when you don t know why someone is upset first ensure that no one is in danger and then attempt to calm them down the best way to get the information you need to do so is to ask what has happened before doing so however assess the situation to make sure you can approach someone safely 12 x research source initially look around are others around who may know what happened or may be able to help are there any apparent dangers in the area offer to help approach the person and indicate that you re there to help if you do not know the person introduce yourself as well be saying something like hey i m ____ and i m here to help if they do not say anything continue by asking if you can join them and beginning to do so as you sit down say something along the lines of if it s alright with you i m going to sit with you for a while 13 x research source if knowledge of your career might also comfort a stranger for instance if you re a teacher doctor or firefighter you might also want to mention this as well avoid giving generalized reassurance though it may be tempting to say something like everything will be okay this ignores how the person is feeling in the moment statements like this may even make someone who is upset less willing to receive consolation ask what you can do to help it s important to establish what has happened keep questions simple but straightforward and try to figure out what has happened specifics things to look for include any indications that a person may be suffering from more than emotional distress and what the person needs recognize that it is unlikely that you will be able to resolve the situations your focus is on getting them calm and seeing to it that they get further help if needed 14 x research source speak calmly slowly and softly avoid whispering or shouting be ready to back off if the person perceives you as a threat or acts aggressively towards you if either of these occur make sure that authorities are on the way but remain at a safe distance listen listen listen listening closely to someone especially someone who is upset takes patience and care holding eye contact may not be appropriate as someone who is upset may feel vulnerable or embarrassed sit with someone quietly ideally beside them make sure your body language is relaxed and don t move around 15 x research source as the other person is speaking offer non verbal encouragement by nodding and making affirmative sounds to indicate that you re listening do not argue with that an upset person is saying they may be saying things that do not make sense or that may even be insensitive keep in mind that your goal is consoling the person not having a conversation and that their brain is likely flooded with emotion stay calm a person experiencing intense emotional distress will also be experiencing changes in their body chemistry that prime them to fight or to flee aside from being extremely sad they will also likely be jumpy easily irritated and confused they will have trouble listening and concentrating and may not be able to follow what you re saying accordingly focus on conveying a sense of safety and an environment of calmness 16 x research source if the person insists on a drastic or unreasonable action do not argue with them rather propose alternatives and otherwise attempt to distract them from any course of action that may be unsafe use humor cautiously while humor and lightheartedness can help people cope it may not be appropriate when someone is deeply distressed let the suffering person take the lead if they crack a joke about a humorous side effect of something that has happened join them in their laughter 17 x trustworthy source american cancer society nonprofit devoted to promoting cancer research education and support go to source humor may be especially helpful in serious situations wherein a moment of respite might help someone calm down just make sure you know the person who is upset will appreciate any humor before trying to lighten up the situation stay with the person until they calm down as long as the person isn t injured or at risk in another way they may simply need to calm down for instance if someone received traumatizing news or witnessed a traumatic event they may become extremely emotionally upset but not be in any medical danger in these situations an ambulance is unnecessary and may contribute to further distress continue providing emotional support and wait until the person is able to speak with you or someone else about what to do 18 x research source,Relationships
how to let him go,no matter how much you love a guy you may reach a point when you realize that things just won t work out this can happen with committed relationships vague relationships or relationships that never quite came to be regardless of how things went down though there are a few essential things you can do to help yourself let him go and move on,ask yourself why you want to hang on even if you consciously want to let him go the fact that you have not been able to do so yet suggests that you are subconsciously hanging onto him ask yourself what exactly it is that you can t let go of oftentimes it is not the person himself but what he represents a relationship the feeling of love the hope of love and so on 1 x research source accept the loss tell yourself that things are over maybe you once had a committed relationship with him or maybe you never quite reached that stage either way you likely realize that the hopes you had regarding him are gone now you need to be honest with yourself on that point before you can move past it clinging to false hope and expecting things to work out will only make you more unhappy when the things you want don t come true 2 x research source grieve there s no shame in crying something sad has happened in your life you have experienced a loss and as with any loss you will go through periods of grief and anger instead of trying to ignore your feelings let them all out the end of any relationship can send you through the standard stages of grief you ll go into denial about what happened then you might feel hurt and guilt after that the anger will likely come followed by a stage of bargaining in which you might tell yourself that you could change for his sake the last stage will usually include some depression and loneliness after you make it through the grief though you ll reach a place of acceptance unfortunately it s only by working through the natural stages as they come can you reach that state of acceptance remember the good and the bad some people want to remember nothing but the good others will remember nothing but the bad either option is less than ideal though because fixating on one side will skew your memory remember both the good and bad parts will keep your thoughts and feelings more balanced it s estimated that roughly 20 percent of people complicate their grief by longing after romanticized memories as such it is easy to keep the guy you lost on a pedestal and to remember your interactions with him as all positive 3 x research source you don t have to demonize him but you do need to accept that he was only human and that the relationship had its issues stop the blame game don t blame him for everything that went wrong but don t blame yourself for everything that went wrong either both of you likely share the guilt and most of what went wrong could very well have been out of your control and his even if you force an apology out of him for the things he did that were hurtful the pain will still remain so there isn t much purpose in persisting in that course reword your negative thoughts into neutral perspectives for instance instead of saying i wanted this from the relationship but he never gave it to me tell yourself our goals were not compatible 4 x research source make a clean break one of the simplest yet most difficult parts of letting a guy go is to cut off all ties with him delete his phone number out of your phone quit cyberstalking him remove all traces of him gifts things he left behind etc from your home it might be difficult to make a clean break if you have to see the guy regularly like at work or at school in these cases keep your interactions with him strictly professional don t socialize with him during breaks and don t go looking for him when you don t have a work related or school related reason to do so find the love inside of you you ve been craving his love and as a result your focus has been entirely on an outside source of love locate the loving spirit inside of you and apply it to yourself in simpler terms learn to love yourself again loving yourself is for your benefit more than anything else but also keep in mind that loving yourself will make it easier for a future romantic interest to fall in love with you too accept that some things are out of your control you may have done wrong with regards to him but more often than not many of the reasons things came to an end were completely out of your control this includes both his feelings and external influences you cannot control how another person feels or how he treats you you can only control your own reactions to that person and the things he does similarly if outside factors like financial troubles put stress on your relationship most of those will be out of your control as well release your regrets regrets are only natural when you face a situation like this instead of ignoring them acknowledge your regrets and release them out into the world by sharing them in some way like telling them to a close friend another option is to write out your regrets and complaints keep a journal specifically for that purpose or type it all out on your computer when you fill the journal or otherwise feel satisfied with what you ve written out you can destroy it the act of doing so is often therapeutic avoid sharing your regrets with the guy in question even if the two of you are still friends and even if he says that he s okay with it sharing your regrets with him will only strengthen the emotional bond you feel toward him which will make it harder to let him go forgive yourself even if you ve acknowledged the parts that were out of your control and released the regrets you have part of you might still feel guilt over the way things ended if that is the case then you must take the time to forgive yourself for any role you had in letting things go sour acknowledge your mistakes but don t beat yourself up over them you re only human and all humans err if you can forgive others for their mistakes you should be able to forgive yourself as well reconnect with who you were when your focus is on a relationship or another person you tend to stop doing the things you enjoy as an individual now that you are trying to shift your focus off the guy in question turn back to old hobbies and interests you involved yourself in before he came along at the same time try new hobbies pursue an old interest you never acted on before or try something that is completely unlike you you can reconnect to who you were while simultaneously transforming yourself into a new improved you talk to someone else find a reliable trustworthy friend or relative to talk to during this time the healing process tends to be smoother when you have a shoulder to cry on and it can be easier to love yourself when you are continually reminded of the friendship or familial love that others have for you once you get past the initial grief of your loss it might be a good idea to ask your friends to stop you once you ve vented for 10 minutes or so it ll ease the burden on them but it can also help prevent you from dwelling and drowning in your feelings if you don t have a friend or relative to talk to you could consider talking to a counselor refresh your entire being right now you are likely focused on yourself as an emotional being you also need to take care of yourself as a physical mental and spiritual being though addressing each aspect of your being will help you become more balanced making it easier to achieve emotional well being focus on the good things going on in your current situation to help your emotional healing this can include loving friends and family a fulfilling career or anything else that makes you happy take care of your spiritual self by praying meditating or involving yourself further in your faith if you have one 5 x research source enrich your mental health by keeping your brain busy and off the past challenge yourself by learning new things and engaging in new experiences your physical health is also important you can indulge yourself with the occasional tub of ice cream but it s far better for your overall well being if you balance out your comfort food cravings with exercise and physical activity as well know that there is no such thing as lost time regardless of whether you spent 1 year or 20 years on this guy that time was not a waste you learned and grew as a person after all your life may not be where you want it to be right now and your focus on him might be partially at fault but that doesn t mean that the experiences you did have were worthless focus on the areas of your life that have experienced growth while your love life was stagnant this could include friendships relationships with your family progress in your career or increased interest in your hobbies any forward motion is positive no matter how small it might seem reflect on the experience think about both the positives and negatives and apply the lessons you learned during that time to your present and future life you might want to put the whole mess behind you but learning from past mistakes and triumphs will make you a stronger person overall figure out your priorities ask yourself what you really want out of life and which things are really important to you by figuring out where your focus should be it will be easier for you to peel that focus away from the guy you lost love can still be a priority but focus on the opportunities to love that are still in front of you in the form of friendships and relationships with your family you can hope for romantic love but set it aside and focus on other things for now cast away your fear and consider the possibilities the future can be a scary notion especially when your plans for the future have suddenly been changed instead of looking at the unknown ahead of you with fear however think about all the possibilities it might hold for you fear causes you to cling to what is familiar and to the things of the past that made you happy even when those things are hurting you in the present considering the possibilities will set your mind in motion on how you can improve yourself the excitement of making a fresh start can often help ease the pain of an ending have hope for the future it can be easy to think that you will never fall in love again after letting go of a guy you felt so strongly for if you tell yourself that too often though you can turn it into a self fulfilling prophecy instead tell yourself that you will have other chances at love in the future even if you don t want to make the pursuit of it a priority right now 6 x research source you need to let go of the old before you can embrace the new so your future relationships can only thrive after you let this guy go understanding that your future happiness in love depends on you letting go of this guy can help you move on imagine the next guy before he arrives cook up an ideal man in your imagination give him all the positive attributes the last guy lacked and let yourself believe that such a man exists and is waiting to be found if you tell yourself that someone better is waiting for you in your future it can be easier to let go of your past imagine a guy who can give you what you never got from the guy you lost and imagine creating a more positive relationship with that guy try to be a little realistic about it though don t imagine some perfect guy who has no flaws then expect to meet him simply imagine a guy who doesn t possess any deal breaker traits that would make a healthy relationship with him impossible be realistic about your expectations the odds of getting together with the guy you lost are slim falling in love with another guy will not solve all of your problems your current pain will disappear someday but it will take time acknowledge all of the unpleasant truths about the future so that you can have realistic expectations about what s to come be optimistic yet realistic at the same time to avoid future disappointments,Relationships

how to know if you re being used for sex,feeling like you re being used for sex is a horrible thing to experience and the dynamics can often leave you wondering if you re overreacting pay attention to things like how often you spend time together without the expectation of the evening ending in sex how they respond if you aren t in the mood or are sick and if you feel emotionally connected to this person trust your gut and be honest with yourself about your interactions to determine if you are being used or not,notice what time of day or night they most often contact you if the texts and calls come late at night or when they re drunk or lonely you may want to consider the possibility that you re being used for sex pay attention to whether you ever hear from them during the day or if they respond to your messages and calls within a reasonable amount of time 1 x research source if they text you every time they re out drinking at a bar and it s late at night they re probably looking for a hookup if you talk often throughout the day about things other than getting together to have sex there may be more depth to the relationship assess how often you stay in rather than go out on dates do they prefer to come over to your place or have you over to theirs if you ask them to go out and do something do they seem uninterested keep in mind that this could be done under the guise of being romantic but staying in means the chances of having sex are much higher than if you re out in public 2 x research source some people are just homebodies and that s okay if the person you re seeing likes to be home think about how often you spend time together that doesn t end in them initiating sex observe how often your conversations have a sexual overtone look at your text messages and see how often the conversation takes on a flirty or sexual tone think about whether or not you have conversations that are about everyday things like work hobbies or funny things that happened 3 x research source pay attention to how your conversations go when you re together too if things always seem to take a sexual turn that most likely means that person has one thing on their mind take some time to think about whether your needs are met during sex if the other person doesn t take the time to make sure you both are having a fulfilling experience they may be interested only in their own needs if at the end of the night you re left feeling unsatisfied and unheard listen to that feeling it may be that you need to speak up and have a conversation but it also could mean that they aren t concerned about your needs 4 x research source if you do ask them to try different things or tell them what you prefer and they don t listen that s a clear sign that they re there for their own benefit think about if they compliment you on things other than your looks everyone appreciates being complimented on their looks but if this person doesn t seem to notice the other great things about you like your intelligence humor or compassion they have a one track mind it comes down to whether or not you feel known and connected or if you feel like your body is the only thing that matters 5 x research source try asking them what they find attractive about you if their list is full of physical descriptions ask them what they like about you other than your looks this could jog a deeper discussion or cue you into their true intentions consider whether they ve ever introduced you to their friends or family if you re regularly having sex but have never met any of their friends or family it could mean that they aren t interested in having a real relationship with you similarly pay attention to how they act when you mention introducing them to your friends are they interested or do they always happen to be busy 6 x research source give their actions more merit than their words a person could tell you lots of sweet romantic things about how they want to be together but if their actions don t match up with those sentiments they may be using you if they say they want you to get to know their friends but never manage to arrange a hangout they don t want it to happen if they say they want to go out on nice dates but are always too tired when the time comes around that signifies that it isn t a real priority for them 7 x research source on the flip side if they are saying things like i just want things to be casual or i m not looking for a relationship right now listen to them those are clear statements about their intentions that shouldn t be ignored ask them to do something that won t end in sex to see if they agree pick an activity outside of the house that has nothing to do with hooking up like volunteering working out going to a community event or even just meeting up for a coffee make it clear that you have a commitment afterward so you won t be able to hang out all day or evening and see if they agree if they always make excuses or are busy they may not be interested in anything other than sex 8 x research source for example send them a text that says something like there s a super cool event downtown next saturday morning want to meet up and get coffee and walk around together i have to meet my mom that afternoon but i d love to spend some time together beforehand you could also say something like i ve been feeling a little cooped up lately and need to get out of the house want to join me for a run at the park after work tell them you re not in the mood and observe what happens next the next time you re together and they go to initiate sex simply say i m not in the mood let s just spend time together if they stop being charming and affectionate once sex is off the table that s a clear sign that they were mainly interested in hooking up 9 x research source if they say that s fine and settle in to simply hang out that is great but if they get cranky or leave you have your answer pay attention to how they act once sex is over after you do have sex do they leave soon after or act like they re ready to be alone do they get on their phone or turn on the tv and stop interacting with you try engaging them in some other activity like getting something to eat going to the movies or just talking to see if they re interested in spending time together even after sex 10 x research source pay attention to how you feel you re treated after sex if you feel ignored or used there is a reason for that chances are you re not being unreasonable or dramatic you should trust your intuition text them about something personal and see how they respond send them a text about a work problem or a conflict with a friend and pay attention to what they say and how long it takes them to respond look for concern compassion or advice if they don t respond or just say something flippant like that sucks they aren t providing you with any kind of emotional support 11 x research source someone who is only interested in sex isn t going to be very invested in your emotional well being observe how they treat you when you re feeling under the weather the next time you re sick or just feeling a little down tell them see if they offer to help you or do something to cheer you up if they aren t interested in seeing you or talking until you re feeling better that is a sign that they re mainly interested in their own needs 12 x research source if they check up on you bring you food or do something else for you that s super nice and shows that they do care about you ask to meet their friends or invite them to spend time with yours try moving your relationship outside of the bedroom if you re worried about it being only about sex try to arrange a hangout with their friends out at dinner or a bar or invite them to spend time with your friends or family the next time you have plans together 13 x research source if they always come up with excuses or are busy when you want to see their friends or have them meet yours pay

how to have a mature relationship,mature adult relationships are founded on good communication and trust when these factors are in place both partners feel supported by and committed to the relationship if you want to help your relationship mature work on building a healthy bond developing positive communication habits and improving trust between you and your partner it may also help to get insight into your past habits to solve common relationship problems,allow your partner to live their truth a mature relationship is free of judgments and unrealistic expectations so you ll have to stop trying to change your partner committing means letting go of the idea that you are right and your partner is wrong it s rarely either you re just different show maturity by accepting and respecting those differences 1 x research source give yourselves permission to keep being individuals because you ll only resent your partner if you give up your own opinions interests and goals for the relationship for instance don t work so hard to convince your partner to like your favorite types of music or food the fact that you both have varying tastes keeps the relationship interesting and vibrant explore the overlap in your core values while it s okay to disagree about small things like how to launder darks the two of you will be happier if you are on the same page about the big things your personal values honesty family charity should be similar or at least complementary 2 x research source sit down and have a conversation about the important topics to come to an agreement mature partners know where their significant others stand on important issues like major career goals whether you want to get married whether you want kids and where you want to live you may not exactly agree but you should be knowledgeable about your partner s values if you do disagree about your partner s stance on major issues like politics and religion ask yourself if you can agree to disagree or if this is a dealbreaker for you define commitment for yourselves commitment in modern relationships means different things to different couples do you and your partner plan to be mutually exclusive in the relationship or are you okay with a more open fluid relationship 3 x research source have a conversation with your partner about what each of you wants in terms of long term commitment others such as friends and family may not agree with your definition of commitment but all that matters is that the two of you agree keep the flame alive mature relationships don t keep themselves going they stay satisfying and happy because both partners have shared interests they still date one another and they make the relationship and intimacy a priority 4 x research source put effort into your relationship by spending quality time with your partner doing things you both enjoy schedule a weekly date night to engage in shared hobbies relax together have sex or merely have an undisturbed one on one conversation make conversation a part of your day build better communication with your partner by finding multiple opportunities to interact and make small talk throughout the day share your goals for the day over breakfast with a prompt like so what s on your agenda today talk at dinner by taking turns sharing peaks and pits of the day if your partner offers short answers during small talk tease out more detail with clarifying questions you might ask what happened that made your day tough today hun when your partner describes having a tough day make small talk more engaging by sharing things you re each excited about such as an upcoming music festival or a special desert your partner prepared be an active listener immature relationships often consist of nonexistent communication patterns which slowly destroy the connection mature partners must strive to keep the lines of communication open by giving and receiving listening is an especially big issue for many couples so be sure to freshen up your listening skills 5 x research source when your partner speaks give them your undivided attention listen to understand rather than listening to reply let them finish completely before saying anything to cut down on misunderstandings restate or paraphrase it sounds like you re saying what you heard to be sure it s what they meant if your partner feels that you actually hear them out they will be more likely to be attentive when you are talking too say what you mean tactfully don t beat around the bush or expect your partner to mind read if you want to voice an opinion or ask for a need to be met speak up however do so tactfully without attacking your partner in the process i or we statements can help you do this 6 x research source for example if you feel like your partner is not practicing adequate listening make a request using an i statement say something like i don t feel like you re paying attention to me can you please put down your phone when i m talking i d really appreciate that stay above the belt in disagreements mature relationships involve partners who fight fair no matter how angry you get strive to keep your voice level and save the insults adding negativity to an already stressful situation only heightens the tension and makes it harder to reach a solution 7 x research source if you become overly angry pause take a break and breathe deeply come back to the discussion when you have collected yourself and are ready to communicate properly to signal that a break is needed you might ask can we take 15 a break is different than giving the silent treatment though don t try to use breaks to avoid conflict once you ve cooled off you need to return to the issue and discuss it with your partner do what you say you will when you don t keep your word in your relationship your partner starts to doubt you and your commitment seemingly minor broken promises slowly eat away at trust and bring insecurity into the relationship aim to be reliable only make promises you can keep 8 x research source for example if you promised your partner you would spend time together over the weekend don t flake at the last minute to hang with your friend keeping your word shows that you prioritize the relationship and makes you appear worthy of trust if you are running late to a commitment or if you cannot make it call as soon as you can to let your partner know what is happening and apologize set and respect each other s boundaries as your relationship progresses you and your partner should feel more comfortable communicating your personal boundaries after boundaries have been communicated do your best to uphold and respect them doing so builds trust 9 x research source for example if your partner expresses a boundary that you not go through her cellphone don t give your partner privacy if either partner refuses to respect boundaries you will have trouble developing a mature relationship try talking to a couples therapist to work on boundary violations rely on your partner for help trust deepens when you and your partner are able to show that you are there for one another you can build trust for your partner and vice versa by asking them for favors if they come through and hold up their end of the bargain you are more likely to trust them when you need assistance in the future 10 x research source for example you ask your partner to pick you up from work when your car is with the mechanic if they come on time they will seem more dependable asking for help can also build intimacy sense you are showing that you trust the person enough to do something for you admit when you re wrong and be forgiving failing to own up to your mistakes jeopardizes trust as does holding wrongdoing over your partner s head although it may seem counterintuitive you build trust by admitting wrongdoing and offering forgiveness 11 x research source if you make a mistake immediately fess up and ask for your partner s forgiveness similarly if your partner makes a mistake be willing to forgive them and move forward holding grudges will bring resentment to your relationship and hinder its growth in some cases forgiveness may not come immediately and that s okay some indiscretions require more time to get through but if you stay true to one another you can overcome anything disclose some of your secrets another way of building trust is making personal disclosures with a partner if the person keeps your secret then they prove themselves worthy of your trust 12 x research source if you re just starting out make a minor disclosure if the person maintains your confidence with a small disclosure you can work your way to sharing deeper more intimate secrets examine old patterns do your past relationships follow a certain pattern review them closely and look for common threads most people s past relationships follow a certain cadence you meet fall in love and fall out of love however the details of where and how you met what made you fall in love and subsequently out of love can give you important insight 13 x research source take a look at your past relationships and look for recurring themes you might even create a table with met fell in love and out of love and describe what happened during each phase for instance if you fell in love with a past partner because they rescued you from depression it makes sense that you might not have felt the same level of attachment with the person once the depression lifted perhaps after your mood improved you began to notice not so great traits about your ex own your destructive habits the hard part about revisiting old relationships is having to take responsibility for the role you played in them ending reflect on your most recent romantic relationships and think about how they came to an end 14 x research source what caused your past relationships to end what could you have done better you might find that each time your partner wants to commit you cheat on them because you are secretly afraid of commitment take ownership for whatever role you played in the relationship s end set concrete relationship goals once you have identified the common patterns that occur in your relationships and the roles you play set action oriented goals to change these patterns 15 x research source let s say you realized that you have a tendency to run from conflict you might set a goal to learn better conflict resolution skills to face your problems if you have commitment issues you might communicate this to a new partner so they can help you take measures to resist sabotaging the relationship when things get serious see a therapist changing faulty relationship patterns is challenging to do on your own it can help to see a professional therapist who can work with you to spot and overcome negative relationship habits so that you can have the healthy mature relationship you desire 16 x research source if you are already in a romantic relationship you might choose to bring your partner along to some of the therapy sessions so you can learn techniques for addressing both your bad relationship habits if your partner is not willing to seek help or work on serious communication issues be cautious about staying in the relationship improvement can t come from just one person,Relationships
how to avoid falling for a one night stand,one night stands can be a great way to relax and have some fun although there is nothing wrong with engaging in a one night stand it can sometimes be difficult to separate sex from emotion however if you take time to prepare yourself emotionally then you may find it easier to have a one night stand and have a great time if you are still thinking of someone after a one night stand then there are also some things you can do to process these emotions and move on,avoid thinking of a one night stand as a way to get a relationship sometimes people have the mistaken idea that one night stands are a great way to find a relationship but this is rarely the case instead use a one night stand as a way to satisfy your need for sex and as a way to have fun and enjoy yourself 1 x research source think about whether you want a relationship or you just want a bit of fun if in reality you want a relationship then try looking for that instead you might get lucky and have a one night stand that leads to more but if you don t you ll end up feeling confused and regretful tell them you re not looking for anything serious it may feel a little awkward but telling the other person up front that you don t want a relationship with anyone at the moment will make sure you are both on the same page this will also eliminate any awkwardness later 2 x research source keep it light and casual before you head home with your lover you can simply say i just want to be up front so that we re both on the same page i want to go home with you but i don t want this to go any further than tonight is that alright with you this can also help you avoid wishful thinking if you have said this to the other person and they have reciprocated that they also don t want anything you won t be left wondering if they wanted something more remind yourself that it is just for fun if you find yourself having feelings that you don t want to have try reminding yourself that you had a one night stand just because it was something fun that you wanted to do not because you wanted to meet your next boyfriend or girlfriend try to be grateful that you met a nice person to have a fun experience with and leave it at that think about why you want to have a one night stand is it because you re just in the mood for sex or is there another deeper reason maybe you re feeling slightly insecure and you think a one night stand will make you feel valuable they key to a one night stand is having it clear in your head that it is just something you want to do for fun if it s because you want to feel needed or desired you may end up feeling bad later on if this is your reason then it may be a good idea to skip the one night stand instead do something that makes you feel good about yourself treat yourself to a facial or go to the gym getting validation from another person may feel nice for a minute but the only person who can truly make you feel good about yourself is you keep things light and superficial when it comes to a one night stand it s best to keep things light and somewhat superficial to decrease the chances that you will fall in love avoid focusing too much on the person s personality values interests etc instead try to find someone who you find physically attractive but don t worry too much about his or her personality 3 x research source try sticking to non serious topics when you are talking with the person flirt talk about the drinks the music the moment or the events of the evening try to avoid getting into deep discussions such as about the person s values passions and other intimate topics you might even try searching out someone who you have little in common with or who has a personality that you don t really enjoy think of a time when you ve thought to yourself that you found someone physically attractive but had no interest in pursuing that person because you didn t like their personality this may be the type of person you can have a one night stand with and not have to worry about falling for them don t stay the night if you end up at their place leave once you ve had your fun staying the night might create a false sense of intimacy because you re sleeping and maybe even cuddling with the other person when you leave you don t need to seem cold or uncaring just explain that you ve got a big day tomorrow and you don t want to be rushed for time in the morning 4 x research source keep in mind that this doesn t mean you have to get up and run for the door as soon as the fun is over you can hang out for a bit if it feels comfortable to do so don t however hang around for hours if they are staying at your place it can be a bit more complicated you could casually mention that you have a really early meeting to get to and they may take the hint if they don t take the hint be polite and let them stay if they want to leave first thing in the morning if you do end up staying the night for whatever reason don t hang around in the morning minimizing the amount of time you have to get to know each other will keep you from developing feelings for them 5 x research source don t be rude about it if they ask you to stay for awhile make up an excuse say that you have plans and you need to get going so you re not late say thank you for a nice time and leave if you think you will end up staying the night e g because it is already really late then consider casually mentioning that you ve got a lot going on the next day do this during the evening that way the other person won t be expecting you to hang around don t exchange contact information if you want to avoid falling for a one night stand the easiest thing you can do is resist the temptation to exchange contact information don t give them your number and don t ask for theirs 6 x research source you should also avoid looking them up on social media if they look you up deny their friend requests it may sound harsh but limiting contact will make it easy to avoid falling for them if the other person gives you their number without asking throw the paper away at the first chance this will help you avoid seeming rude but will also eliminate your ability to contact them if they do send you a friend request and you don t want to deny the request without any explanation you can also just send them a quick message saying something like thanks for the request i had a great time with you but i don t really want to take things any further than that i wish you all the best skip the one night stand if you don t think you ll be able to avoid developing feelings for the other person and you don t want to deal with the aftermath of those feelings consider skipping the experience altogether this is not to say there is something wrong with having one but if it leaves you feeling sad then maybe it isn t worth it don t friend them on social media if you haven t already looked them up on social media then resist the temptation to do so if you have already done so then delete them having access to their social media will only make you miserable 7 x research source similarly if you have any other contact information of theirs delete it this will make it impossible to contact them to see if there is any interest from their side don t hook up with them again if you choose not to get rid of their contact information or if they contact you for another hookup say no it may seem like a good idea at the time but it will only drag you further down the rabbit hole be aware that you will probably try to rationalize with yourself about why it is a good idea to hook up again for example if they call you up and ask you to come over you might say to yourself well hooking up with them again might help me get it out of my system or hooking up again will remind me that i didn t think they were that great anyway it is very unlikely that either of those things will end up being true remind yourself that it was just for fun use your one night stand as a learning experience perhaps from your one night stand you have learned that it isn t so easy for you to have casual sex without letting feelings get involved now you know that it isn t something you take lightly and that is ok too 8 x research source try to think of it as a learning experience for example you had a fun time with an attractive person or you got to experiment sexually you have to deal with the repercussions of that night but that doesn t mean it has to become a bad memory think about the mismatched aspects of that person when you have feelings for someone especially early on it is easy to dismiss the aspects of that person that don t mesh well with who you are since your goal is to get over that person try to focus on the differences in your personalities lifestyles interests etc hopefully this will help you realize that a relationship would not work out for example maybe that person was a really bad fit in terms of personality lifestyle or in other areas such as being a really shy person while you are someone who likes to get out and socialize try to be as honest with yourself as possible when you think about the ways that you and this person are mismatched look for a more meaningful relationship many people recommend giving yourself time to heal after a breakup but in this case you didn t break up with someone so there is no reason why you can t look for a more emotionally committed relationship this will help you realize that the one night stand was great but it doesn t necessarily equal love 9 x research source you can try online dating if you aren t sure how to meet other people looking for relationships ask friends if they know of anyone they could set you up try doing something that you enjoy which also gives you an opportunity to meet other people for example volunteer for a cause you care about if you are religious become a member of a church this will help you find people that you share values

how to know if you stand a chance with someone you like,though it can be very exciting to have a crush it can be nerve wracking as well making the first move might be scary but remember that more often than not many people are attracted to you without your knowledge through assessing the situation reflecting on the signs and flirting with the person you like you can determine if the feelings are mutual,assess your current status with them if you have never spoken to the person you like this could be potentially advantageous or problematic for you depending upon the situation if you are already friends with them or know them in some capacity it may be easier to approach them with this information and more risky the more aware you are of your status with them currently the better able you will be to develop an approach that will be successful if they are currently in a relationship you should respect that relationship and not initiate any romantic contact if you are just acquaintances you stand very little risk but you also don t know if they like you at all you should assess their actions and move forward if you think you could have a chance or it feels important to you to express your feelings though you should be good at handling rejection and not taking it personally before you take this risk blindly if you are just friends you know them already but you also run the risk of messing up your friendship think about if changing your friendship is worth it and if you could still be friends if they are not interested talk to your friends your friends particularly those who know the person you like will be able to give you invaluable insight into whether or not you have a chance with them think about which friends will be honest with you some of your friends may be too afraid to hurt your feelings and encourage you even if they don t think you really have a chance with that person if you have a friend with a history of being honest with you even in difficult situations ask their opinion of whether or not you should make a move on the person you like the next time you all are around the person you like ask your friends to pay attention to the situation so they can give you feedback later plan a group outing a group outing is a great way to assess their level of interest in a non threatening way plan a trip to the bowling alley movie theater or mall and invite them as well as your mutual friends this is a great way to interact with them in a safe setting and have your friends exist as buffers should you get nervous or should things get awkward if they try to stay close to you throughout the night more so than with others you can determine that you do have a chance with them group outings are also a great way to allow them to see you having fun which could result in them developing an interest in you watch their friends often times when people have a crush they tell their friends and their friends give away clues notice if when you are around them if their friends make little jokes or hint at a relationship between the two of you if they encourage physical contact like trying to make the two of you hold hands this could also be a sign that your crush is crushing on you as well 1 x research source check out their social media see if they have posted anything lately about having a crush or being interested in someone don t search too far back into their history however opt instead to just skim over what kinds of things they have been posting over the past few weeks you never know one of their statuses or tweets could be about you this may also help you figure out if there s someone else in the picture if they post something like had and incredible day with someone really special and you didn t see them all day then you might consider that they have a crush on someone else see if they allow you into their personal space if your crush backs away from you when you get close this could be a sign that they are not interested if they remain in the same spot or move closer to you however then perhaps they do like you when you are interested in someone often times you want to maintain a closeness with that person 2 x research source think about if your crush goes one step further and initiates contact with you do they give you hight fives hug or tickle you this may indicate they have feelings for you too reflect on how often they try to spend time with you one of the true markers of whether someone is interested is if they make an effort to be around you if you do not know the person this information may be less relevant but if you are already friends or if you are in a class together this can easily be assessed 3 x research source if they try to spend alone time with you this could be a sign that they like you if they try to be your partner on a group project or sit with you at lunch this could also be a sign that they are interested also consider how much and often they text or call you and if they regularly like or comment on your social media posts if you are acquaintances notice if they say hello or make an effort to chat with you when you cross paths assess their level of engagement one surefire way to know if someone is interested is to assess the kinds and quality of interactions the two of you have typically when someone likes you they will try to learn more about you often through asking questions they also tend to notice you more closely than the average person or friend would think back on any times that your crush remembered something about you or something you told them in the past if you can think of such times then it is likely that they like you 4 x research source consider the kinds of questions they ask you the deeper the questions the more likely it is that they are interested assess their body language beyond them trying to get closer to you consider other ways that people show interest via body language often times when someone makes eye contact with you when you are speaking or when they are speaking to you this can be an indicator of attraction eye contact is a way that people show interest in the conversation and by extension how they express interest in others 5 x research source notice as well how they interact with others if you see them being touchy feely with everyone else but not with you then perhaps they are not interested at the same time treating you differently from everyone else could indicate they feel nervous around you because body language can be confusing try to look at other factors as well notice if they face you in a crowd gravitate towards you or sit near you when possible see how they react to your touch their reaction to your touch says a lot you might try touching them on the arm during conversation such as when they make you laugh or even resting your head on their shoulder if you are friends these are great ways to test how comfortable they are around you if they don t like you they will likely tense up and this can serve as your sign to stop touching them in that moment however if they feel comfortable with you they will act normal or even better eventually start touching you back if they start touching you back this is one of the biggest signs that they may develop feelings for you 6 x research source try touching their shoulder randomly for a second or two while they re speaking or elbowing them gently and casually in the arm when they make a funny joke the safest way to touch them is to mirror the ways they touch you if they do things like nudge you in the shoulder or hug you when they see you then you can do those things with them as well without them first initiating change up your body language flirtation and expressing affection for someone is about much more than just words your body can also express your feelings use your body language to make gestures that indicate that you like them 7 x research source lean into them slightly when they talk look softly at them in their eyes when they speak smile brightly at them when you see them or when they say something cute laugh at their jokes put your hand on their shoulder briefly when you laugh at them or touch their knee briefly when you sit side by side and are speaking to them you can also hug them when you see them and when you are about to leave compliment them more this is a great way to let someone know you like them without actually having to tell them most people enjoy receiving compliments and your crush is likely no exception if they look particularly attractive one day let them know if they do well on a school project or an assignment at work let them know that you admire their intelligence and work ethic 8 x research source if this is a little too bold for you you might simply say it s been really fun talking to you as you part ways don t overdo the compliments however too much of a good thing can sometimes be a bad thing stick to once or twice weekly for a while show interest in them being a good listener is often a very attractive quality and it shows that you are interested in their lives interests and opinions when your crush is talking ask questions and make eye contact so they know you are listening try to remember key parts of the conversation so you can bring it up again later for instance if your crush was talking about a band that they like you might go home and listen to them the next time you see your crush you can say hey i checked out that band you were talking about or if your crush says they are nervous about a big test coming up you can follow up later by asking them how it went be respectful whether your crush likes you or not you should always maintain respect for them people respond positively to being respected and treated well and your crush is no different whether you begin dating this person or if they ask you to maintain your distance never speak badly of them and always respect their boundaries 9 x research source in addition to only speaking kindly of them respect their wishes if they ask you to tone it down on the flirting you should do so give them the space that they need go for it if you have determined that you have a chance with your crush whether that chance is slight or large you should go for it set aside some time to talk to them in person and tell them how you feel do it in a quiet space like a park so that noise does not distract them face to face interaction is best but if you cannot do so you can also write them a letter or call them on the phone good luck remember that if they are not interested in dating you it s not a reflection on you it simply means this isn t the person for you you deserve to be with someone who is excited to date you so try not to waste any more time on this person evaluate your feelings before you make a decision to pursue this person fully you should think critically and carefully about why you like them and why you want develop a relationship with them sometimes we find ourselves developing false attractions to others just because they are popular or because someone else likes them take a few moments to think about the things that you like or that intrigue you about this person and determine if a relationship with them is worth exploring 10 x research source for instance if you want to date them just because they are attractive this may not be a good enough reason to pursue a relationship however if your heart skips a beat when you see them or if it makes you jealous to see them date other people your feelings may be worth exploring journal your thoughts after taking some time to think about the person you like and why you like them consider writing out your thoughts on paper or in your diary many people benefit from processing their thoughts via writing and this can often help elicit thoughts and feelings that you may not have been aware of write out a pros and cons list of pursuing a relationship with this person determine if they are a good match for you often times we can be so caught up in the emotions of liking someone that we forget to consider logic though having a crush can be an exciting time it can also be a time when people make foolish decisions certainly follow your heart but make sure your head is involved in the process 11 x research source consider the values this person has and if they align with your own values for instance if you are very religious but this person is not that could be a problem in the future don t ignore this if you don t know the person very well you may not know much yet about their values you can however look for any glaring red flags for instance you may have heard that this person is always getting hauled into the principal s office for bad behavior or has even been in trouble with the law as cute and mysterious as this person might seem this is a red flag that you probably shouldn t date them talk to someone you trust though your friends can be a great source of help and support sometimes you can t beat the advice of mom and dad they have likely experienced many more crushes in their lives than your friends have and might have very good advice on how to proceed and whether or not you should proceed at all you might say something like hey mom i was wondering have you ever had a crush on someone but didn t know if you have a chance with them i d like some advice work on overcoming your shyness perhaps you are a person who keeps to themselves and is very quiet you may find it difficult or stressful to make friends or interact with new people instead of thinking of yourself as being nervous consider yourself as being excited often times the feelings these emotions elicit are very similar but it is up to us to control our minds so that we can be the masters of our own destiny stay calm take deep breaths and approach the situation with confidence and excitement make a list of your strengths to help boost your confidence try writing out what you would like to say to your crush practice your conversation in the mirror and visualize the conversation going really well,Relationships

how to stop criticizing others,criticism is toxic to healthy relationships while it s okay to express frustration if someone is behaving in a way that hurts you being overly critical can cause tension in any relationship over time 1 x research source first work on changing your own behavior to catch criticism before it begins from there find effective ways to communicate if someone bothers you lastly work on educating yourself and challenging any assumptions you have that make you an overly critical person,think before you speak before you dish out criticism pause and consider whether you really need to say anything at all if someone did something to get on your nerves do you really need to point it out sometimes it s best to let small indiscretions go try taking a few deep breaths and leaving the room instead of criticizing 2 x research source it s best not to criticize someone s personality people have very little control over personality quirks if your friend jane has a tendency to get caught up in her own interests it might be best to just smile and nod while she s going on and on about a new tv show she loves if this is just something she does criticizing it will probably not result in the behavior changing 3 x research source avoid criticism that goes for someone s personality over his or her actions for example it may be a problem that your boyfriend forgets to pay his phone bill on time each month however saying something like why are you so forgetful isn t terribly productive it may be best to be quiet for now and later when you re calm talk about finding productive ways to better manage bill payment such as downloading a phone app that will provide a reminder when it is time to pay the phone bill every month 4 x research source be realistic critical people often have very high expectations of those around them it s possible your tendency to criticize stems from expecting too much from those around you if you find yourself consistently annoyed or disappointed with others it may be a good idea to adjust your expectations 5 x research source think about the last time you criticized someone what lead to this criticism were your expectations in the situation realistic for example say you criticized your girlfriend for not answering your texts quickly enough when she was out with friends you told her this made you feel uncared for and that she should have answered right away pause and examine these expectations can you really expect your girlfriend to be on her phone when she s socializing isn t your girlfriend entitled to a social life outside of your relationship you have probably occasionally missed texts or returned them late if you were busy in this case maybe you could adjust your expectations it may not be reasonable to expect a text returned immediately if you know your girlfriend is hanging out with other people depersonalize other people s actions oftentimes critical people have a tendency to personalize events that occur around them this can bleed out into personalizing the actions of others if someone gets on your nerves or makes your life difficult you may feel the urge to criticize that person however remember other people have their own separate lives and struggles if someone did something to bother you the majority of the time their actions were not directed at you for example say you have a friend who routinely cancels plans you may take this as an act of disrespect and feel compelled to criticize that person for not valuing your relationship however realistically your friend s actions are probably not personal look at the situation from an outside perspective is your friend very busy is she just generally a flaky person is your friend more introverted than others a variety of factors may make a person cancel plans often chances are it isn t about you personally criticizing may add more stress to someone whose life is already stressful separate the individual from their actions critical people are often guilty of filtering this means you only focus on the negative aspects of a situation or a person failing to see good qualities alongside negative ones 6 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source this may lead to your criticizing others if you find yourself making assumptions about a person s character stop yourself try to separate a frustrating action from the person doing the action we all behave poorly sometimes but a single action is not a reflection of character if you see someone cut in line do you immediately think that person is rude if so stop for a moment and reconsider maybe that person is in a hurry maybe he has a lot on his mind and he did not realize he cut you can be frustrated by the action getting cut in line is annoying however try not to judge a stranger s character based on the action 7 x research source if you work on separating the person from the action you may naturally want to criticize less as you come to realize you cannot judge a person s character based on a single choice or decision you will be unable to call someone out for being rude or disrespectful focus on positives oftentimes being critical results from how you re choosing to see a situation everyone has flaws and imperfections however the vast majority of people have good qualities that outweigh these flaws try to focus on a person s positive qualities over their negative ones having a positive attitude can change the way you react to stress negative emotions activate the amygdala which is a major trigger of feelings of stress an anxiety if you re feeling keyed up yourself this can lead to negative interactions with others working on developing a positive attitude can help you stop criticizing others 8 x research source believe everyone has some natural goodness in them while you may be skeptical of this fact try giving everyone the benefit of the doubt in this regard go out of the way to look for people doing good in the world focus on the person in the supermarket who told the cashier to have a nice day pay attention to the coworker who always smiles at you on your way to your desk 9 x research source oftentimes people s flaws actually stem from other positive qualities for example your boyfriend may take a long time to complete basic household tasks this could be because he s more conscientious than others maybe he spends an extra 20 minutes doing the dishes because he makes the effort to get them extra clean give feedback rather than criticism as stated some people have issues that may need addressing a friend who s chronically late on bill payments could use some guidance a co worker who s consistently late for meetings may need to work on time management however feedback is very different from criticism when addressing an issue focus on suggestions you can make to help another person improve this is more effective than simply criticizing people tend to respond better to productive statements offering them feedback and encouragement over flat out criticism 10 x research source let s return to an earlier example your boyfriend always forgets to pay his phone bill on time each month this leads to unnecessary stress and is starting to affect his credit rating you may be inclined to say something like why can t you pay more attention to bills or why don t you just remember when it s due this may not be helpful your boyfriend already knows he needs to be more conscientious but for whatever reason is struggling to do so instead provide feedback rooted in praise that works towards a solution say something like i love that you re trying to be more responsible why don t we get you a big calendar from the staples downtown when you phone bill comes you can write down when it s due you can also offer to help in any way you can for example i can remind you to write down when the bill s due each month ask for what you want directly inefficient communication often results in heavy criticism if you re not telling someone what you want that person cannot be expected to know make sure to ask for what you want in a direct respectful manner this will eliminate the need for criticism down the road 11 x research source say your boyfriend always forgets to wash utensils after using them instead of letting your anger over this pile up which could result in your criticizing later address the problem right away 12 x research source be respectful when addressing the problem do not say stop putting dirty forks in the sink it drives me crazy just wash them instead try something like can you please work on washing your forks after you use them i notice our utensils pile up a lot 13 x research source use i statements difficult situations do arise in any relationship if someone hurt your feelings or upset you this needs to be addressed instead of criticizing express the problem using i statements i statements are sentences structured in a way to emphasize your personal feelings over external judgement or blame an i statement has three parts it begins with i feel after which you immediately state your feeling then you explain the actions that lead to that feeling finally you explain why you feel the way you do for example say you re upset because your boyfriend has been spending the majority of his weekends with his friends do not say it s very hurtful that you spend all your time with your friends and don t invite me i m left out all the time rephrase the above sentiment using an i statement say something like i feel left out when you go out with your friends and don t invite me because i feel like you don t spend any downtime with me consider the other party s perspective judgment and criticism go hand in hand if you criticize others too often you may be shutting out the other person s point of view try to step in another s person s shoes before criticizing genuinely try to see things from that person s perspective think about the criticism you re about to say how would you feel to be on the receiving end of that criticism even if what you re saying has some truth are you phrasing it in a way that will go over well for example if your boyfriend is consistently late you may be inclined to say you re being incredibly disrespectful to me by always showing up late chances are your boyfriend is not trying to disrespect you and he may feel attacked by criticism phrased in this way how would you feel to have someone lash out at you like this 14 x research source also try to consider outside factors that affect behavior say your best friend has been less social lately she may not be returning your texts quickly or at all is there anything going on in her life that affects her behavior for example maybe you know she s stressed at work or school maybe she just went through a difficult breakup this could be affecting her ability or her desire to socialize try to understand this and not jump to judgment look for a mutually beneficial solution to problems finally a good way to cut back on criticism is to look for a solution to issues you re having with others criticism should ideally be working towards an effective solution to a negative situation simply being critical in and of itself is not helpful 15 x research source tell someone what you want him or her to change let s return to the boyfriend example maybe you want your boyfriend to keep better track of time tell him ways he can get ready to go faster let him know what timeframes you re comfortable with for example maybe you strongly prefer to arrive at events slightly early let him know this so he makes an effort to be ready to go a little earlier you should also be willing to compromise for example getting to a party 30 minutes before it starts may be a bit much maybe you can agree to arrive 10 to 15 minutes early from now on instead challenge your assumptions about others we make assumptions about other people all the time making too many assumptions too frequently can result in being overly critical as you go through your day challenge yourself when you find yourself being critical maybe you assume someone who dresses well or wears a lot of make up is materialistic that person could actually be insecure dressing in a certain way might make that person feel better maybe you see someone who didn t graduate high school as lazy or unmotivated however that person could have had extenuating circumstances at home that disrupted his or her studies 16 x research source remember everyone makes mistakes when you see someone slipping up remember a time when you did not behave or act your best for example if you re judging someone for cutting you off in an intersection remind yourself of your own past driving mistakes 17 x research source work on yourself is there an issue in your own life that you re taking out on those around you if you re unhappy with your job relationship social life or other aspects of yourself try to address these issues the stress of a negative attitude can affect your overall health and well being leading you to unable to handle stress 18 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source this can lead to poor social interactions if you take steps to be a more positive person you may be better at interacting with others you ll be able to cope with conflict in a more effective manner educate yourself many people have hidden disabilities before you judge or criticize a person stop and consider the possibility that person is dealing with an issue you cannot see easily the co worker who seems rude because she does not make small talk may have social anxiety issues your friend who constantly talks about cats may be on the autism spectrum the student in your algebra class who continually asks the same questions may have a learning disability spend some time browsing informational websites that discuss hidden disabilities before you make an assumption about someone s character remind yourself many people struggle with ailments others cannot see 19 x research source seek therapy if necessary if you find your criticism stems from your own unhappiness therapy may be necessary conditions like depression for example can cause you to have angry outbursts directed at others 20 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source therapy can help you better manage your emotions and be less critical if you feel you need therapy you can ask for a referral from your regular doctor you can also find a list of providers through your insurance if you are a college student you may be entitled

demonstrate that the other person needs a break or is to upset to resolve any issues right now though it may seem obvious don t be glancing at your phone scrolling through social media or messaging people this shows that you are fully focused and paying attention to the person in front of you 3 x expert source stefanie safran mba dating coach matchmaker expert interview 8 may 2020 use i statements communication is not about blame it is about responsibility i statements start with how you are feeling about the behavior or action of your partner it means you take ownership of your

things and getting caught up in anger many couples use a 24 hour rule in this scenario if things get too heated they table the discussion for 24 hours so both parties calm down and are able to talk it is pretty rare to find a discussion that can t wait for a cooling down period if need be 6 x research source discuss issues upfront instead of letting them grow in size it is a relationship myth that a solid relationship does not require work be prepared to put the work in you can accomplish this by addressing any problems with your partner before they rear to their ugly heads 7 x research source for example you notice your partner withdrawing more money out of a shared account than usual instead of building a case over time you might address the issue right off by saying i noticed you have been needing more money lately do we need to adjust our budget to account for this you will never be perfect nor can you expect this from a partner there will always be issues that come up and you can either learn to treat them as you would any other obstacle or you can hide them until they balloon into a huge problem make a commitment to hold a weekly check in in which either of you can bring up any issues you have on your chest communicating problems with the idea of tackling them as soon as they come up helps you establish a strong foundation make sure that you try to follow through with whatever you two say and decide over the course of your conversation plans are only useful if they re carried out 8 x expert source stefanie safran mba dating coach matchmaker expert interview 8 may 2020 be willing to compromise pick your battles wisely not every issue needs to turn into a battle there will be some that need to be talked out others that go unsaid and finally some that just end up not being important compared to what you gain from the relationship 9 x research source compromising may include writing out a pros and cons list to points of disagreement and talking through the list objectively talking aloud may clearly point out which choice is mutually beneficial it also means finding a way that both of you can have your needs met without jeopardizing the needs of the other another way you can compromise is doing things one person s way one time and then favoring the other person s opinion the next time for example you may watch one person s favorite movie one night and the other person s top pick the next night before you find yourself waging war against your partner about a small issue assess how important the matter truly is to the happiness and growth of your relationship if it s truly not a big deal move on work through problems as a team relationships are about the we and not the i or you focus on honest communication to work through problems together with room for each of you to give and take learn from one another instead of working against one another 10 x research source for example if you need a sum of money to pay for a big purchase you can sit down and find ways for both of you to contribute each of you can put money into savings for a span of time or cut back on non essential expenses using terms like we as in we will get through this or us as in let us figure out a solution together help foster a teamwork approach every relationship comes with ups and downs when you encounter an issue go through it logically and objectively and make a decision based on a the mutual well being of both partners make your values and needs known to your partner be sure to clearly define what you need from a partner and what you intend to give to your partner follow through on your obligations to your partner and speak up when he or she isn t doing the same in a constructive manner 11 x research source it is a myth that you do not need to tell your partner what you value and need you are mistaken to think that simply because your partner loves you he or she should know what you need mind reading is impossible and the expectation of it merely hinders your growth 12 x research source communicate your desires simply by saying something to the effect of charity is really important to me what can we do to honor that moving forward get on the same page about finances this is one area that can be very dangerous if you ignore it until it becomes a bigger issue make sure you share financial values early on in the relationship if you want to save for the future while your partner lives for the moment this may not end up lasting long term 13 x research source sit down and discuss where each of you stand financially create a budget if you live under the same roof talk to a financial counselor if you have trouble seeing eye to eye date each other no matter how long you ve been together this includes giving your partner the same level of respect and attention you did from the start many relationships end as one partner just stops respecting the value or feelings of the partner and fall into old habits they never would have done early on for example texting an old flame after you are married shouldn t happen if you wouldn t expect a new date to be ok with that why should your spouse ignore it simply because you are married 14 x research source treat your partner with the utmost respect strive to make him or her smile make an effort to schedule quality time shared between the two of you continue to demonstrate

or repair loss trust by 15 x research source being there for your partner both physically and emotionally being consistent in your actions showing up when you say you will keeping confidences respecting your partner s personal boundaries doing what you say you will do have mutual and separate interests you cannot expect another person to complete you or to be everything that you are it is healthy to share interests and to also maintain some activities you do apart when you enter into a partnership you become a team but each part of the team will gain something from also taking time to be an individual 16 x research source a relationship should allow you to be your core self while giving you someone to love and cherish it will not be good for you or your partner if one of you become codependent and requires the other to take an interest in anything support one another s passions and dreams support these dreams and also recognize you cannot make all of them come true you are there to love and encourage their dreams not to take responsibility for achieving them 17 x research source while the two of you should have separate dreams it can also be unifying to have shared goals that you work towards as a team have a talk with your partner and brainstorm some dreams you d like to accomplish together it can be brought simply by stating i think it d be great if we set some shared goals what are some things we can work towards together,Relationships

for someone is reducing the amount of time you spend with them especially time spent alone avoid the person as much as you can if possible if you can t completely avoid them make sure the two of you aren t spending time together alone 5 x research source for example if this person asks you out for drinks suggest that you make it a group activity to limit alone time instead surround yourself with

relationship status if this person has a significant other envision that person s face or name whenever you re fantasizing about them this may help you maintain objectivity accept that the heart wants what it wants being in love with someone and acting on those feelings are two very different feelings sometimes no matter what you try your heart can t prevent itself from falling for someone however if you don t want to be in a relationship or aren t ready for love don t act on those feelings 8 x research source acknowledge that you like the person and really enjoy their company but remind yourself that you re not in the market for love right now one way to do this is by examining key goals in your life that you would like to accomplish before falling in love again for instance maybe you d like to finish your degree before entering a new relationship or maybe you want to travel the world investigate your issues with love it s understandable to want to push others away when you re afraid of being hurt or let down but doing so can prevent you from having someone really special in your life try to get to the root of what s driving your feelings journal or talk it out with a friend 9 x research source for example maybe you fear being cheated on because that happened in the past or maybe you are afraid that falling in love with someone will make you give up on your dreams

experiences with dating and relationships may help you change your luck with love 10 x research source ask yourself questions like what do i usually do in these situations can i identify any common patterns that might influence the outcome for instance during your reflection you might realize that you regularly enter into relationships before you have healed from a breakup in these rebound dates

example is pushing people away because you fear abandonment then when they leave it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy try letting someone in for a change the relationship just might turn out differently change your type another reason you may want to stop falling in love is because you always pick the same type of partner maybe you choose someone who is unavailable who is a bad influence or who can t commit changing your type could lead to a different outcome 12 x research source think about the type of partner you typically fall for now when you re ready to date again go for someone who is the complete opposite for example if you typically go for the bad guy demeanor choose someone who is more conservative maybe you tend to like spontaneous people who blow off their responsibilities at the drop of a dime but you might find that going out with someone who is more serious and reliable may give you a more satisfactory relationship change it up and see slow down are you the type to fall in love in less than a week if so your tendency to rush things could be what s affecting your relationship success taking things at a slower pace may give you more time to judge a prospective partner s character and determine if you are compatible before you re already head over heels think about the pace of your relationships if you tend to meet someone new and end up spending

how to change someone else s behavior,whether you want your girlfriend to respond to your text messages more quickly or want your friend to stop chewing with her mouth open you will find that changing another person s behavior is really hard it is definitely not an impossible task but there are only certain behaviors you can try to change about other people ultimately though you can only make changes to yourself that will hopefully positively affect the people around you,identify the behavior pinpoint the exact behavior that you want to change about the person if you want the person to just be less annoying or text me more often you will not get the results you want pinpoint the exact behavior you want to change and mark exactly how you want it to change for example rather than saying that you want your friend to be less annoying plan to say that you want your friend to stop interrupting conversations she s not a part of or instead of wanting your partner to text you more often you could want your partner to text you good morning and goodnight every day determine if the person is open to changing that behavior ultimately you cannot force anyone to change you can only change things about yourself this idea applies both to you and to the person you re trying to change see if the person wants to change and believes that he has the capacity to change 1 x research source don t actively ask the person if he is open to change instead try to figure out if there s a possibility that the person wants to change in some situations it might be appropriate to ask that person s friends and loved ones what they know about this behavior and what the person has done to change it if the person has tried to quit smoking several times before he might be open to trying again with a different approach if the person has tried he at least at one point believed he was open to change you can also pay attention to what the person says about the topic and life in general if the person says fixed statements like i ll be fat forever or i guess i m just not a smart person the person may not think that he can change if the person does want to change or is at least open to the possibility of change you might be able to help him change his behavior however if the person does not want to change you might not be able to do anything about the problem at this point tell the person that the behavior bothers you the person may not realize the extent to which her behavior upsets you choose a time to talk when you are calm have enough time to have a long conversation and have thought about what you want to say do not raise your voice or yell at the person make your feelings about the behavior very clear to the person for example say when you are late i feel like i am not a priority to you and that hurts my feelings give specific examples when you were late meeting me last week you made us both late to the bon jovi concert and we missed the first song i was really mad about that because i love bon jovi and those tickets were expensive ask for what you do want instead for example say next time you re going to be late could you please call me and let me know once you ve made your wishes clear back off and do not belabor the point nagging her if she already knows what s wrong is unlikely to have a positive outcome know what you can control you can change certain things about yourself such as what you say how you say it and how you act when you try to change someone else you are changing something about yourself in an attempt to incite change in that person accept that you cannot change some things sometimes despite your best efforts someone will not change again it is important to note that you cannot force anyone to change if the person doesn t want to you can say things to try to affect change within that person but you are an agent of change not the change itself no matter how many times you tell your friend to tie his shoelaces he does not have to tie his shoelaces 2 x research source decide if you can accept the person if this behavior does not change get comfortable with the possibility that the person may never change because it s quite possible that he will not how would it feel to simply live with the behavior is it possible you could change your own behavior and attitude to accommodate the person or are there ways to work around it ask yourself if you can accept the person as he is if you cannot accept the behavior then you may need to end the relationship if you can live with this behavior try to avoid situations in which it might arise for example if you hate when your friend sings in the car avoid long road trips or listen to music that he doesn t know consider whether there are any ways to work around the behavior would it work to simply tell the person a time to meet you that is a half hour earlier than necessary is there something that could be purchased that would solve the problem for example if your complaint is that the person will not clean the litter box like he promised can you buy a self cleaning one while these don t address larger problems such as the person not following through with his promises but they may help you accept the person as he is if you cannot live with this behavior you may need to cut off contact with this person if your boyfriend s drug problems are out of control for instance and you think that living with him will be extremely detrimental to your own health you should consider breaking up with him and cutting off contact it can be painful but if the behavior is greatly impeding your life you owe it to yourself to consider your own health and happiness give the person information about the behavior that will encourage her to change it even if the person knows that you do not like her behavior your own distaste for the behavior might not be enough to make her want to change it to attempt to change her mind about changing the behavior try giving her information about the habit that makes it seem undesirable or worth changing for example you could try saying joanie i don t know if you know this but smoking can be really harmful and lead to lung cancer my uncle was a lifelong smoker went through chemotherapy for lung cancer last year and it was really hard for my family to see him through that painful time in his life if you have been suffering in silence or trying to drop subtle hints these few steps may solve the problem entirely often information alone is not enough to change a behavior however information combined with your opinion as a trusted acquaintance friend or family member might be enough to convince a person to attempt to change once you ve made your wishes clear back off and do not belabor the point nagging the person if she already knows what s wrong is unlikely to have a positive outcome increase the person s awareness of the negative behavior the person might not even realize that he is doing this behavior and therefore might be open to changing it for example it might drive you crazy when your friend chews with his mouth open but if he s done this his entire life he might not notice that he s doing it remind the person gently what he is doing and how he could stop be polite 3 x research source for example you could say ed could you please chew with your mouth closed the chewing noise bothers me be nice especially if the person is unaware you should not say ed you re chewing like a cow cut it out this strategy will only work if the person is doing the behavior essentially by accident if you want your mom to stop smoking and you make her aware that she s smoking every time that she smokes your strategy will probably be ineffective give positive feedback positive feedback

how to apologize to a girl,every relationship no matter how strong it may be will see its share of problems and arguments studies in gender communication have observed there is often undue strain in apologizing even if the man otherwise acknowledges he has erred 1 x research source in the majority of cases an apology is and should be regarded as a positive way to reopen dialogue after following a fight an apology demonstrates a willingness to be vulnerable with one another while it can sometimes involve biting your tongue at first a sincere and well delivered apology can mean the difference between lasting pain or growing closer together,acknowledge apologizing as a way to move forward no matter why you are apologizing remember that the goal is to make up with the girl and improve your relationship 2 x research source at its core an apology is an emotional concession that can have great returns if properly and sincerely delivered it has been found consistently in studies that men have a far more difficult time of apologizing than women if you count yourself among those who find difficulty in apologizing approaching the act as a purely practical manoeuvre at least at first can help you get over that first hump give yourself time to relax 3 x research source if you need to make an apology to a girl then you are probably dealing with some pain as well if you recognize that you re not feeling good at the moment you should see first things first and give yourself time to heal depending on how bad the situation is this could mean minutes hours or days don t let yourself put the apology off too long however being silent long enough will be interpreted as a non apology that you aren t sorry and don t want to have anything to do with her again interpretation of what is considered too long will depend on the severity of the situation and the strength of the relationship 4 x research source understand why she is upset apologizing without meaning it or knowing why can make things worse than if you simply kept your mouth shut if you rush into an apology the woman will detect you re not being honest before you apologize it s important you take a moment to stop and reflect why is she upset are the possibly other factors that are playing into her mood how serious is the problem 5 x research source put yourself in the woman s shoes for a moment while you should be considering the way she is feeling you should also imagine the way your actions have been interpreted by her in turn if your apology is because of a certain thing that happened try playing it out in your head from there regardless of who is to blame you should have a better grasp why she is upset keep in mind that empathizing with why she is upset is distinct from necessarily admitting guilt even if you don t think you have done anything wrong per se a healthy relationship involves recognizing where the other person is coming from even if you think at first her reasons for feeling this way are unjustified or even irrational it s important to recognize that the pain is real 6 x research source be sincere with your apology if the problem in question is severe enough a woman will be analyzing your delivery for any possible signs of fakeness the best way to ensure your apology is received as you want it is to make sure you actually mean it if you think you ll need to grit your teeth as you apologize it s a good idea to hold off and reflect upon the apology some more or do without one altogether 7 x research source you may be very angry for the same reasons as the girl this will make it hard to open yourself up to her if this is the case give yourself some more time to relax and breathe wait for the right time to apologize 8 x research source the art of apologizing has partly to do with the right timing you would never want someone to apologize to you if you were in the middle of watching a movie much less cramming the night before a big exam rather you should bide your time within reason mind you and wait for an opportunity where the girl is free and relatively relaxed again you won t want to wait too long before going in for your apology if you wait too long it may be considered by the girl as a conscious decision on your part not to apologize approach her solemnly the way you approach a girl to apologize in person will have a big influence on whether or not the apology is accepted approach her quietly and calmly don t let yourself be distracted by anything else your apology should have your whole attention as you approach make sure to make steady eye contact don t smile too much or act too loosely you want to tell her with your body language that you acknowledge the seriousness of the situation the question of approach is easier if you are apologizing over a text message or the phone though you should keep in mind that an apology will only be at its most effective and affirmative if it s done in person if you re not in a position where you ll be able to run into her easily ask her to meet up keep your invitation simple and to the point but give her reason to believe the reason you re meeting is to give you a chance to apologize if she s too angry at the moment give her some time hopefully she ll come around and give you an opportunity to fess up tell her you re sorry before you go into anything else you should let her know from the start that you re sorry if you try to explain why you re sorry before she actually knows you re apologizing she may interpret it as an invitation to argue once you ve approached her take no time to let her know you re sorry any explaining can wait until after you ve made the basic point being straightforward sounds easy on paper but when there are emotions flaring up from both sides it can be hard to see it through all the way don t let yourself get too worked up over it if need be remind yourself that this is a step in a process towards reclaiming your connection your apology need not be elaborate in fact it s probably best that you keep it in as simple terms as possible no need to be poetic or calculated here just say i m sorry the more complicated you get the higher chance there will be that the apology will be misconstrued as something else express empathy something as simple as i m sorry will go a farther ways than you think but it won t be enough for the more serious things once you ve opened up the conversation like that it s time to go into greater details as to why you are sorry and how you understand the way she s feeling if it develops into a more balanced conversation and the blame wasn t one sided you might take the opportunity to express some of your own feelings as part of the healing process but only once you know the apology s been accepted 9 x research source for example as a general template you might say i m really sorry for what i did i was being really selfish at the time and the way i see it s affected you has made me realize just how bad it was i know i can t undo what happened but i want you to know that i wish i could take it back and i won t let it happen again allow her a chance to respond petty grievances probably aren t worth fussing over too much but more serious issues will probably beget a response to your apology once you ve laid your cards all on the table it may come time for her to tell you how she feels look her in the eyes remain calm whatever you do and process everything she says even if what she says makes you angry try to empathize with her she may still be feeling angry from what happened and this may colour the way she reacts towards you in a less than pleasant manner 10 x research source hug her 11 x research source a verbal apology is often best accompanied by some sort of physical affirmation regardless of the specific type of relationship you re in a hug is almost always appropriate hugging at the end of your apology will give the woman a physical show of how you feel and her acceptance of your hug will offer some closure to the both of you take steps to prevent future incidents an apology is just words if it isn t taken to heart if you are apologizing for something you did work on preventing it in the future doing things to fix the problem at hand has two benefits first it will practically reduce the chances of the situation happening again and second she will see you putting your apology into tangible actions if you make a habit of rinsing yourself of apologies once you make them you ll have a much harder time getting your apologies accepted in the future 12 x research source for instance if you are apologizing for being late all the time set your alarm ten minutes earlier than you usually do this will make your actions more prompt thus reducing the risk of being late again letting the girl know the steps you ve taken will prove to her that your apology was sincere 13 x research source write an apology letter handwritten apologies are the best non verbal way to apologize the length and tone of your message will depend largely on the severity and cause of the message forgetting a birthday is a far different matter than abuse or infidelity for example what is important however is that you write from the heart do away with the pretence of formal letter writing write what you re feeling and let the girl know you are sorry within the first two sentences including a heart at the bottom denotes warmth and may be appropriate if you re in a romantic relationship with the girl writing it by hand is important in this case an apology letter is nothing if it isn t backed by a personal touch and vulnerability it s much easier to mask emotions over a computer however for small matters a quick email or instant message can work as well make amends through positive action if you ve done something to hurt the girl s feelings doing something to make her feel good in consequence is a good way to make up for past faults 14 x research source the way you go about making up to her is as potentially diverse and unique as the relationship itself if you can think of some things the girl is interested in you should think of those as potential opportunities to set things right if you can t think of anything specific there are few women out there who don t appreciate having back massages or dinner being made for them it doesn t need to be anything too elaborate a simple gesture can say a lot about the way someone is feeling make a donation in her name 15 x research source a more formal way of apologizing to a woman could take the shape of a donation in their name although this probably only suits less severe or personal issues an apology can in fact have greater weight when a dollar sign is attached to it of course giving someone money would make it feel like a dirty bribe so making a donation to a charity will carry the good intention without any of the foul undertones donations however small should be accompanied with a specific statement why you re making it explain to the girl that you re making this donation as a way to affect positive change in the world from your apology giving the fight you had an altruistic benefit for the world charity helps the world and is near impossible to argue with,Relationships

can help set you up for success hopefully if you re interested in a particular friend the word will get back to them if you re open to a friendly hook up with a couple of different people this might inspire one of them to approach you it will also be easier for you to suggest a hook up if your friend already knows you re open to it they ll likely be less surprised 2 x research source when you re out with a group you can drop this information into the conversation try sounds like you had fun last weekend i d love to have a no strings attached thing like that with someone cool talk to your friend about your expectations before hooking up take a minute to explain to your friend what you want this doesn t have to be a long in depth talk but before things get physical make it clear that you are looking for a casual hook up not a relationship 3 x research source you could try i m really into you but before we go any further you should know that i m not looking to date you is it okay with you if this is just some casual fun clearly state your boundaries to avoid feeling uncomfortable let the other person know if there are things that you are not comfortable with this might include physical acts or talking to others about the hook up if you state your boundaries upfront this can prevent things feeling awkward mid hookup 4 x research source say something like i m into hooking up with you but i m not into actually having sex okay you could also try can we keep this between the 2 of us please tell someone where you ll be as a safety measure even when you re hooking up with a friend you need to take steps to ensure your personal safety let a friend know where you ll be who you re with and ask if they can check in on you at a certain time it s always better to be safe than sorry this is especially important if you ve been drinking alcohol since that can impair your judgment 5 x research source send a close friend a text that says something like hey i m leaving this party to go to brad s he and i are going to hang by ourselves for a while would you mind checking in with me around midnight to make sure i made it home okay even if you re not planning on hooking up

hook up to just be fun and casual take care to make sure that you aren t left with any unwanted effects use condoms if you intend to have sex even oral sex if you re female you might consider taking additional birth control 6 x research source if the other person doesn t want to use a condom it s probably not a good idea to hook up with them choose a friend that you don t want a relationship with if you ve been harboring a crush on one of your friends it might sound like a good idea to try to hook up with them but remember a friends with benefits relationship might not go any farther than that if you re actually interested in pursuing a relationship with someone try to date them instead of just starting a hook up relationship instead try flirting with a friend that you like but don t want a more traditional relationship with 7 x research source if you have a crush on someone in your friend group you might think twice before hooking up with another mutual friend the word might spread and then your crush will never know you re interested in them flirt with your friend so that they know you are interested it can be hard to transition out of the friend zone so you ll need to make an effort to send signals to your friend try holding their eye contact for just a moment or so longer than normal so that they are sure to notice you you can also find ways to initiate physical contact try leaning forward and touching their hand to emphasize a point they are making you can also gently brush your foot against theirs if you re sitting next to each other 8 x research source you can also try sending a flirty text like i couldn t help but notice you looked great tonight can t wait to see you at the party tomorrow or similar if your friend pulls away from you or seems offended or uninterested back off you don t want to put any pressure on them talk openly about your boundaries and expectations maybe things will go your way right off the bat before you know it you and your friend might be kissing but before it goes any further take a minute to let them know what you are looking for explain what your personal and physical boundaries and what you want to get from hooking up with them 9 x research source you can say this is fun just so you know i m not looking to really date anyone right now are you fine hooking up as friends you could also say i like my own space so if you don t mind i don t like to have people sleep over another good thing to explain is if you would prefer if they don t hook up with anyone else while you two are intimate use humor to combat any awkwardness even though you know each other it might feel uncomfortable when you first get physical try joking around to lighten the mood you can also just acknowledge any discomfort that you might feel 10 x research source you could say something silly like i would have done this sooner if i knew kissing you would be like this you can also just say um i m enjoying this a lot but it s a little awkward isn t it that can really lighten the mood accept no as an answer if the other person is not interested if you ve flirted and maybe even suggested a hook up you might assume your friend is into it however if they say no or make any other sort of excuse you need to respect that while you might feel disappointed your friend has a right to make this decision 11 x research source be gracious and just say that s cool i hope this won t hurt our friendship understand that hooking up can change your friendship before hooking up reflect on your friendship ask yourself questions about how you would feel if it changed and what it means to you if you decide that you aren t willing to risk your friendship consider finding someone else to hook up with for better or worse your friendship will probably be different than it was pre hookup 12 x research source you might discover that this is a fun exciting new element of your friendship that makes you even closer it could also turn into a more traditional relationship unfortunately it might turn out to be awkward and uncomfortable even worse it could potentially end your friendship be prepared to deal with that it you go forward with hooking up check in with your own emotions frequently as your hook up relationship continues it s important to make sure that you are still comfortable and enjoying yourself take stock of your emotions regularly maybe every week or two ask yourself if you re happy with the way your friendship has changed make it a point to notice if you feel sad or uncomfortable 13 x research source if you re happy great carry on if you re experiencing negative emotions you might consider stopping hooking up talk honestly about your feelings even though you and your friend aren t in a traditional relationship it s still helpful to communicate this can help you both work through any issues that you re having whenever you feel the need let the other person know how this is working out for you 14 x research source you can try saying something like i m really having fun with you how are you feeling about hooking up you could also say i feel like things are kind of awkward now when we hang out in a group i think we should stop hooking up allow a relationship to develop if you both want it to you might realize that you are interested in being more than friends with benefits if that s the case tell your friend how you feel likewise be open and honest if your friend initiates the conversation about taking things further if you both want more discuss what that means to each of you 15 x

and awhile it s important to me it makes me feel like things are not equal between you and me how can we fix that thank him when he pays if you have decided that you are okay with him paying then the

x research source try saying something like the following thank you for dinner that was the most delicious lasagna i ve ever had tonight was great thank you i m so glad you were there that movie was

source another way to change it up is to offer to split the bill in half or to go dutch each person paying for what they ordered with the bill it doesn t need to be a big deal just let him know that

split up by parts for example if he pays for dinner then you pay for drinks and dessert if you are going to the movies he can pay for the tickets and you pay for drinks and popcorn pay for alternate dates you can also take turns with who pays for what dates this works well with friends too if he pays for dinner one night the next time you go out you pay then the next date you have he pays and so on back and forth this is a good way to evenly split the responsibility of paying without having to do check math every time the bill comes go on inexpensive or free dates if you are uncomfortable

people often imagine that other members are like themselves 3 x research source use this to your advantage by allowing your conversation partner s imagination to fill in the details they already expect some example questions and responses q what did you do last night a oh the usual you know me i ve always got something going on q what are your plans for this weekend a well i was thinking about meeting up with some people downtown learn the value of a raincheck the key to this strategy is to accept the invitation but not the occasion tell your friend or acquaintance that you ll gladly take them up on the offer some other time but that you already have plans for the date mentioned be careful not to deny offers too frequently or you might end up appearing cold or distant 4 x research source it can help if you have some emergency chores or errands in reserve this can also be a kinder way of postponing plans with somebody as it is less direct and cold than a simple no when you are

been lately i keep missing your parties next weekend i m free if you are you have no idea how much i d rather be hanging with you but something s come up and i have to take care of it divide your

want to take some time to talk one on one with those who are well regarded in your community 7 x research source prus robert c i beyond the power mystique power as intersubjective accomplishment i

or hint at non specifics as an example a hey what were you and the class president talking about the other day b nothing in particular aside from what everyone is talking about but i really don t want to continue that conversation here so maybe we ll pick it up again later use names sparingly language can sometimes have a strange effect on people like making them unwilling to tear paper upon which the names of family members have been written 8 x research source by withholding a name in conversation you leave the subject you are talking about vague and uncertain which by association makes you more difficult to pin down practice using general forms of address i ll be downtown tonight with some people my cousin introduced me to so this guy i met through a friend of mine from way back said he had exactly the same problem as you appreciate the difference between being elusive and being rude the point in being elusive is to evade physical or mental capture but rudeness is hurtful to others

wood or tapping on the frame of a door before entering a room have a soft calendar there s no point in wasting your time alone just to give the impression that you re an elusive person so why not plan ahead and look up activities to keep you occupied in the meantime a soft calendar is filled with events that might be nice to do but can always be done later a soft event like going to the park is flexible where a doctor s appointment you scheduled a month ago is not a soft calendar can also be a source for excuses in the event you offer a raincheck if a friend asks you to come on an outing you might tell him that you were planning on going to the museum and that you would love to join some other time if you should change your mind like in the case of you finding out your best friend was also going on the trip you can always say you know i can go to the museum any day i think i will join you this time stay aware of your surroundings you never know when you might need to make an escape to sustain your elusive charm among your friends when you are spending time at a public place do some reconnaissance the day before or look up a map online this way if you feel the need to disappear

would be off putting and you want to hook his attention first before you really get to know who he is and what he s about make strong eye contact and smile maybe you don t want to approach him directly so make eye contact with him smile then look away repeat if necessary because he may not get it the first time one look and smile may be a fluke but two or three are totally intentional 3 x research source if you don t smile as well as make eye contact you may just come across as creepy so smile ask to borrow something maybe you need a pen or a pencil and you could ask the person next to you for one but why would you do that when you re in class with your crush go up to him and ask him for what you need most people won t refuse to let you borrow something small like a pen or pencil so he probably won t deny your request this also gives you an excuse to go back and talk to him again when you have to return whatever you borrowed take the opportunity to be a little flirty and say something like you re my hero i never could have finished ms pepper s test without your pen be creative and don t waste the opportunity seek assistance maybe you re at the library and need help finding a book maybe you ve lost your backpack whatever it is find your strapping young man and try to get him to help you 4 x research source make sure the request is at least a bit legitimate if you

to him again and thank him for all his help this is the perfect opportunity to start a second conversation sit down nearby once you re in close proximity introduce yourself and start making good conversation if he is sitting at a small table in an empty classroom or is the only one in the dining hall or at the cafe then it will be awkward if you sit next to him try to play it cool keep up the conversation hello is just a start and you won t get very far if that is all you say to him now you ve broken the ice and are having an okay conversation but don t know how to take it to the next level think of some good questions to ask like what makes you smile what s your favorite film video game book if you could travel anywhere in the world right now where would you go and why what sports do you like what was your proudest moment what do you look for in a girl what is the most insane thing you have ever done what do you like eating 5 x research source remember this isn t an audition if you have only an okay conversation you can always start another conversation later the more you talk to him the more comfortable you will be around each other get his number if you ve had a decent conversation ask him for his phone number you will probably see him around a lot but it s always good because then you can call and text each other if he picks up that you re interested in him he may save you the time and ask for your number if you are unsure on how to get his number there are guides that show you all the necessary steps try to be friends this is how to really know a guy building off your first conversation dig deeper and try to find out what really makes him tick small talk is great for first meeting someone but it s called small for a reason there s so little of it you soon exhaust its potential you don t have to think about what to say in advance but think about how you are going to move from discussion about your interests and friend groups and into more substantial things if you don t know exactly how to proceed start by asking your guy friends or your brother s if you have any they are guys too so they may be able to tell you something that you could say or do however remember that all people are unique and their advice may not be the best for the specific person you desire don t make your friendship the final stage of your relationship you became friends with him to get to know him but you want to be more than just friends if you get to know him pretty well and you feel like you want to proceed further try to make that clear to him drop hints about your intentions flirt pay him compliments or ask him to go do things with you if he doesn t pick up on your subtle hints you can be sure his friends will when he tells them about what you two are doing 6 x research source remember he may like you too but people are shy don t be afraid of making the first move if he is someone you want to be with,Relationships

and smile keep your body language open don t cross your arms or legs put away your phone headphones book et cetera so she doesn t think you re busy keep a positive respectful attitude women look for people who will treat them right she wants to know that you ll listen to her take her seriously and take care of her needs you want her to think that you re a catch rule out women who aren t dressed to impress some women dress down as a signal that they re not looking for romance which makes it easier for you to focus on those who are however not every woman who dresses up is looking for a date sometimes women dress up because they want to have fun with friends or to help them feel good about themselves they may not want attention from strangers focus on body language this is much more reliable for finding women who are interested look for women who are looking for relationships some women bounce around talking and flirting with people these are the women to watch because there s a good chance that their goals are similar to yours start meeting her eyes smiling and looking her way try approaching when she s in between people to flirt with watch women s body language some women

for or make the approach a bolder woman may walk over to you or if she s shy or nervous she might be hesitant if you ve caught each other s eyes a few times and she s smiling start with light positive conversation talk about something small the goal isn t to have a deep conversation it s to evaluate her body language and whether she s receptive and for her to check you out too compliment her once or twice talk about the location or the weather listen to her women want to be heard being interested is more important than being interesting ask her about herself and pay attention to what she says if she s talking and talking this means she feels relaxed around you it s a good sign pay attention and remember what she says for later make sure that you re non threatening your goal is to make her feel at ease not to make her feel like prey being stalked you want her to relax and feel safe around you so she can have fun respect her personal space don t come too close too quickly don t block her exit let her leave if she wants avoid pressuring her if she wants to leave she can pick up signals look for signs that things are going well you want one who gives you a good vibe here are signs that she s into you and that she s interested in talking more and maybe seeing where things can go she s an active participant in the conversation talking to her is pretty easy she s looking at you her hands and posture are relaxed she smiles and laughs easily her arms and legs are uncrossed she turns her feet and body towards you both of you seem to be having fun let her go and try a different woman if this woman seems stressed some women are skittish and not ready for a hookup they have a hard time saying no because they re scared that you ll get angry or aggressive if she looks agitated give a friendly smile tell her to have a good evening and walk away then look for a woman who s more relaxed here are signs that she s not into it and you should quit wasting your time she gives short one word or small answers she keeps looking around like she s looking for an exit she doesn t look at you much or at all she seems tense she s fidgeting and looking awkward she gives a polite smile which means her mouth smiles but it doesn t reach her eyes she s crossing her arms or legs she turns her body and or feet away from you she d rather spend time with friends tonight she says she has a boyfriend even if she s lying it means you re wasting your time here you find it hard to keep a pleasant conversation going you re doing all the work slow down if you get mixed signals some women might be confused unsure what they want or struggling to make up their mind relax slow down and follow her lead if she decides she wants to kick it up a notch her words and body language will start showing it pushing her will only push her away keep an easy come easy go attitude would you hook up with any woman on the street of course not similarly women may have a type or different plans for the night that s okay nothing s wrong with you it just wasn t meant to happen let her go and look for someone more open if you re telling yourself maybe i can convince her that s a sign that it s going downhill and you re wasting your time a good catch is one who doesn t need convincing see how she reacts to being complimented talk about her hair her eyes her outfit her smile or something similar if she seems pleased rather than awkward this is a good sign break the touch barrier try brushing some lint from her sleeve or placing a hand on her shoulder find an excuse to gently touch her see if she likes it or if she touches you in return this suggests she s interested see if she starts talking sexy she may try to drop hints that she wants to take this to a bedroom such as by showing off her body to you biting her lip and smiling or talking suggestively invite her to go to your place or wherever she pleases make your invitation and see what happens some women are hesitant to enter other people s places this is normal if she suggests her place instead flash a smile and say sounds great follow her lead some women like to go fast and some like to go slow pay attention to her mood and body language it s okay to ask questions like do you like this or what would you think about ____ many women like this because it lets them know you care what they want and are open to ideas from

your thoughts it shows maturity and patience if you find yourself offending or irritating people with what you say or your constant chattering remember to listen to your brain and think about your

isn t just about you it s about all the people involved 5 x research source if you re talking about your day or something that you do ask the other person about their day or what they ve been doing

they weren t paying attention ask questions about them get to know them better consider saying things about their family interests hobbies favorite movies sports music or other topics that can help you to know the person see if you can remember one thing you learned about them that you can refer to next time you talk to them this will keep you from talking about yourself and let them know you were interested in what they shared encourage others to talk rather than filling up the conversation let s say you re the more talkative person in a group you might want to talk more if others are

them when they are mid sentence briefly apologize if you catch yourself doing this let them know this is something you re working on find spaces or breaks in what they are saying before you add your comment learn to rephrase or echo what they ve said one important part of good listening skills is demonstrating that you were not only paying attention to what someone was saying but that you understood what they were say by rephrasing or echoing what someone said you are asking for clarification more information or a deeper understanding 6 x research source this rephrasing or repeating

being overly talkative is a nervous or stress related habit that can be controlled watch out for any concerns that your excessive talkativeness may be pressured rapid and seemingly uncontrollable maybe it feels like you can t stop and the pace of speech seems inappropriately urgent if this is your situation talk with a mental health or medical professional for an evaluation there may be medication or therapy that can help 7 x research source evaluate if you constantly crave to be with others or get your energy from talking with other people you may be strongly extroverted and thus might come off as bothersome to others if you are constantly restless and want to talk with people be aware that sometimes anxiety and stress can lead to heightened or rapid talking find ways to notice what you re doing and refocus your mind on how to stay calm focused and relaxed in that moment practicing mindfulness techniques and meditation may help get feedback from a counselor if your

aspirations your life goals and your expectations be clear about what you want so you can determine whether or not the two of you are on the same page also keep in mind that people change over time so

way they interact might not work for you don t compare your ideal relationship with someone else s surprise your partner relationships require time and energy try to switch it up a bit and surprise your partner every once in a while this could mean doing something sweet to break the routine or coming up with a grand gesture to show them how much you care 8 x research source try giving your partner flowers or cooking breakfast for them in the morning you could also plan a special date or a trip away for just the two of you make sure to give your partner space as well and do not try to

them about what you think and how you feel 10 x research source work on talking things out even when you re upset at one another talking about your feelings can help you resolve fights and avoid future problems for example try saying things like when you cancel our plans it makes me feel like i m not a priority in your life or you could say i have been feeling a little depressed about my work situation lately so i would really appreciate it if you could be understanding about that and help cheer me up keep in mind that while it is good to be insistent to fully express your wants needs and desires in any relationship be mindful of considering your partner s needs wants and desires also if you push too hard to express what you want in a relationship it might have the opposite effect and

how to get good at picking up girls,picking up girls is a skill and as with any other skill the fundamental idea is the same you start by practicing it consistently and learn more along the way to enhance it below are some key habits and practices that will help you get good at picking up girls,have fun when you go out having fun and amusing yourself should be one of your primary motives as when you are having fun anxiety and fear lessens and you naturally feel non needy and don t take rejections too seriously which is quite attractive to most people so its important to amuse yourself and talk about things that you find interesting and funny with common sense regardless of if the other person would like them or not as you will read later also if you are not having fun you are more likely to give up because you will take rejections seriously go out often like any other skill pick up should be practiced on a regular basis so going out consistently helps a lot don t use going out often as a crutch though as a start it can help to go out consistently until it becomes second nature so you don t always have to dedicate special time to practice you can practice while you re grocery shopping walking around town running errands commuting via public transportation etc it is highly recommended that you read how to cold approach a girl and how to pull a girl home to get yourself started know how to stop girls properly there will be many occasions when you will need to stop a girl to talk to her the way you stop a girl is quite important as it can distinguish you as being either creepy or confident here are a few guidelines for different scenarios when a girl or girls are walking towards you the start talking or wave at them while they are about 7 to 15 feet away from you use common sense don t start talking when they are too far away or too close this would not surprise them much and they would have enough of a time window to let their initial reaction subside for example when you and the girl are walking towards each other wave to her and say something that you find funny like hi do you know who said love is trash people need cash or do you know only when a mosquito lands on your face that you realize the violence is not always the answer or something indirect like hi do you know if there is a coffee place around here or a situational opener like where did you get the hat you are wearing as per the social conditioning she usually would stop then you can tell her your intentions like i was just kidding i thought you are absolutely adorable and i had to say hi you can also remain indirect on the basis of the response and vibe exchange with the girl in fact remaining indirect can help you stay longer in a conversation which helps hone your interactions skills at the same time be sure to honestly sub communicate your intentions as you will read in the next section also if you want to be more dominant simply stand in front of the girl woman as you give her a hand gesture to stop make sure there is enough distance between you and her see if this works for you or not if not no need to keep redoing it a humble smile helps a lot if the girl is walking in the same direction and is in front of you then jog or run up to her give her a light tap on the shoulder and say hi this may surprise her but it communicates confidence alternatively you can just walk up to her until you are shoulder to shoulder turn your head towards her say hi and do your spiel try to make sure that she sees you coming another way would be to call her from the back say something like excuse me or hi as you are a walking towards her and when she stops or turns around do your spiel when a girl is behind you and is walking in your direction simply turn around and do your spiel make sure there is an appropriate distance between you and the girl so you don t surprise her too much stand your ground don t follow the girl or walk backwards if she s walking away despite your assertive request of asking her to stop or after doing your spiel stand your ground and let her walk away you wouldn t want to talk to someone who can t stop for a few minutes to have a conversation with you however it s okay to walk with a girl if she genuinely seems to be in a hurry and or asks you to walk with her it s also fine to walk with a girl for some time to tune into her state when you feel you are in tune you can ask her to stop or simply keep walking with her if you just want to get into a social mood interact with her or build social muscle whatever feels more natural of course only if girl is fine with you walking with her be calmly assertive and lead with common sense most girls like an assertive commanding and leading guy 1 x research source it doesn t matter how confident or independent they are it s because of biological and evolutionary factors 2 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source many of the attractive girls most likely will not stop or have a conversation with you unless you are leading and assertive try this next time when a girl is walking away from you then assertively but calmly say something like hey wait i am talking to you as you wave her to come to you if you do it right it may turn on a biological switch in her head and make her compliant yes attraction is mutual but you are initiating and leading it this doesn t mean to force yourself to be assertive use common sense and naturally calibrate as per the response from the girl and your personality so you don t have to be assertive all the time also since many people are becoming more conscious and coming out of societal and mental conditioning so a growing minority of women don t have high and sometimes irrational expectations like high status good looks muscular a lot of money alpha male etc also keep in mind that a good number of the girls will not be interested in you due to the factors like being taken personal choices biases or life situation 3 x research source manson mark models attracting women through honesty pg 65 just move on and no need to keep doing the same thing again and again if its not working for you being in touch with breath and or inner body helps a lot considering the large number of rejections from cold approach pickup it should not be seen as only way to meet and date girls it has other deeper benefits such as getting out of comfort zone public speaking non neediness having fun being social practicing non reaction present moment awareness making you more aware of deep seated mental patterns caring less what people think etc recognize the level of interest from girls girls can be categorized into three categories yes girls yes girls are those who are attracted to you from the beginning itself these are the girls who are easiest to maintain conversation and go on dates with 4 x research source manson mark models attracting women through honesty pg 68 unless you screwed up something that attraction remains almost indefinitely to identify yes girls here are some signs they keep a longer eye contact with you than usual laughing at your not so funny jokes touching you following your lead and mirroring you inviting you for meetups not leaving even though the conversation is getting cold maybe girls these are those girls who are not sure if they are attracted to you or not to get them to be attracted to you you need to be polarizing from the beginning itself or they will lose interest polarizing means to talk and do things that you genuinely find fun your humor and interesting with common sense and calibration it also helps to filter out girls pretty quickly with whom you would not be more compatible with however at the same time being polarizing may offend others which is ok but it helps to not be highly and explicitly polarizing from the beginning itself as girls may get too repelled so its a good practice to be slowly and subtly polarize to filter out girls who would not be compatible with you so they don t get offended too much for example be alert and notice the girl woman s reaction after you made a polarizing joke which you find funny like have you realized that life is sexually transmitted alertly notice the reciprocation from the girl like how she laughs motivation to continue the conversation body language tone of her voice etc this comes with practice and is quite yielding in the long run especially if you practice at the same venues as quickly you would be able to pickup subtle hints like facial gestures tone in the voice eye contact etc to know if you will get along or not and exit out of a conversation read how to be polarizing for more info on this no girls these are girls who are not attracted to you at all it is better not to waste your time and theirs as you are most likely not going to get anywhere 5 x research source manson mark models attracting women through honesty pg 69 some no girls may flirt with you just to seek attention you may use that to improve interaction and social skills but do not take that seriously the majority of girls will be maybe or no girls sign from these type of girls could be not keeping a good eye contact with you giving short answers ignoring you like checking her phone looking away keeps talking to her friends etc pointing their feet away from you as if want to walk away here s something to observe in your self if you feel like you are trying too hard as if trying to make her talk to you feeling resistance or unease within you like heart chest and face region etc then these could be a signs that she s a no girl or you are not polarizing enough or having fun it may be better to have fun i e polarizing or move on and learn from it record yourself it can be quite yielding to record yourself while practicing pickup watching your recordings can improve your social skills by many folds as it can help clearly identify your mistakes and sticking points of which you were unaware of such things can include body language facial gestures weird noises you make up talk unassertive tone neediness poor eye contact supplicating behavior etc in fact it s so important to record yourself that without it you will most likely end up ruminating for weeks or months or years trying to figure out what you might be doing wrong you don t have to record every interaction just a few recordings from time to time should be good enough to help you recognize your sticking points and make you more conscious of the mistakes you have been making repeatedly before you go out and start recording interactions ensure that it s legal in your country or jurisdiction for example recording someone without their consent is illegal in most states in the us 6 x research source if that s the case do it at your own risk audio recording most smartphones have a recording feature so use yours as a recording device just wear earphones as if you are listening to music or wrap around neck like a stethoscope and turn on the recorder before approaching make sure to test it before going out to see if the voice quality is good enough when recorded from different angles you can also use a digital recorder with a good quality mic for better sound quality look it up on any e commerce website video recording if you want to go more advanced you can have a friend video record you before every approach turn on your audio and signal your friend to start video recording it s pretty fruitful as signalling makes it easier to sync audio and video while using a video editing program or you can use spy or body cam again do it at your own risk yes it may make you cringe to listen and or watch yourself but that s exactly what you need to become more aware of your sticking points and good things as the truth will be right in front of you if you are open to it make a deep genuine connection most guys want something from girls it could be sex social status physical intimacy showing off etc even if they get it they don t feel satisfied why it s because the human mind is inherently needy or insatiable it always wants something without realizing that no possession relationship or achievement can provide it a long lasting fulfillment 7 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 20 read last step of how to stop being needy for more insight here s the deeper truth in essence she s a human being like you this means they have been through phases of suffering and happiness have a life story have passions or interests and most importantly in essence you both are the same isn t that enough to make a deep connection with them the deeper you go into it the more you will realize that sex or physical intimacy is just a by product of true communication dropping the small talk and jumping to deeper conversations is also polarizing be content with what you have rejoice in the way things are when you realize there is nothing lacking the whole world belongs to you tao te ching here are few conversations topics that can help passions childhood goals personality traveling sense of humor ups and downs in life ambition and favorite things watch the linked video for more details 36 questions if you truly realize the essence of who you are it would be immensely easier to make a deep connection with people as in subtle or apparent ways they will be naturally drawn to you if they already have some depth when you realize where you come from you naturally become disinterested kind hearted as a grand mother dignified as a king tao te ching at the same time be practical yes most of the guys are result oriented which means that getting laid is a great motivator and end goal for them so instead of trying to make a deep genuine connection which doesn t work anyway simply be aware of this to naturally internalize it into your game as you explore its benefits in the long run or experiment with it to see if it works for you or not and adapt it in to your game as you will read in section 3 remember that honest communication of intentions is important even if you are making a deep connection with a woman you may not necessarily want to commit to her and this should be communicated through your intentions so she doesn t feel lead sub communication body language tone etc should be aligned with what you say in the long run it s about your priorities what is your intention and is more important to you is it physical looks sex showing off meaningful connection or all and to what degree be very truthful as intention is communicated far more than your words only knowing and accepting this will take you beyond the states of desire and fear this means that if you are into looks or your goal is to have sex then be honest rather than trying to suppress your intentions however simply be aware that your actions are motivated from your desire to have sex with women as mere awareness will eventually take you beyond either way no trying although if you are trying than don t force yourself to not try as you will read later understand romantic connection romance has a very high value for women because of the fundamental idea it s based upon in ancient times men were the ones who used to provide for the family while women used to rear children and take care of the house even though people are slowly coming out of it as many environments supports self dependence but the majority of the people still have the same conditioning 8 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 57 romantic connection implies to a woman that a man will be there for her when she needs him that s what makes it so powerful and rare this is something to become aware of make a habit of talking to older or less attractive girls or even guys when you go out as you can stay longer in a conversation with a less attractive or older girl woman so it d be easier to practice having a normal fun and genuine conversation with them without wanting anything thus helping you improve your social skills and develop non neediness also this practice not only help you to perceive people beyond their looks but also helps change and dissolve your pre conceived concepts biases and paradigms that cause a lot of suffering and missed opportunities it also helps you gain reference experience if you want to see it that way plus it s a practical way to get yourself in a social mood and sustain it so when you approach that hot girl you find attractive you are already in a more fun and confident state polarizing doesn t always mean to move on to other girls because you realize that you are not going to be compatible with them keep in mind that seeing people through concepts or beliefs on the basis of their looks age or background and other traits is not only limiting yourself and others but also missing not so often opportunities to meet some genuinely cool people and know their life experiences by following this practice you may have experiences that can change your current paradigms and mindset for good which can put you on a fast track and can cut down years of effort and frustration this is one of the reasons why you should not reject the opportunities to interact or go on meetups or dates with girls who are taken or are less attractive when people see some things as beautiful other things become ugly when people see some things as good other things become bad tao te ching again at the same time be practical about it yes attraction towards good looking girls women is a great motivator 9 x research source so it s fine to use this motivation to approach and date hot girls but at the same time to go beyond it be aware that the motivation is coming from attraction towards their fleeting physical looks which is based on conditioning desire else you will remain stuck at that level and won t be able to go deeper read last step of how to become mentally flexible for more use non reaction to deal with tests girls are very good at testing your patience and you as a person overall it s an inherent behavior so at times they don t even know that they are testing you they will do all kinds of shenanigans and play games just to get a rise or reaction out of you it s like they are qualifying you to see if you deserve them or not for example if they say something like you are quite older than me i am just a little sophomore girl what would be your normal response it might be something like yeah i know but i am not that old or i have dated girls your age before these are defensive and supplicating responses instead turn the tables by looking deep into their eyes and say something like yeah i am old i don t think you can handle me i always wanted to be a sugar daddy or yeah you better watch out i am a pedophile this way you can also qualify them it s like using the opponents energy against themselves without conflict or using force as it s seen in non aggressive martial arts like aikido or tai chi so play it cool a non reactive and non needy mindset is extremely attractive to most girls second example if they say something like i have a boyfriend or i am seeing someone then instead of replying with generic answers like okay it was nice meeting you remain non reactive you may reply with something like oh yeah me too or amazing let me give you a hug then go in for the hug or oh that s fine i don t mind a three way or but i love you though etc it s like subconsciously telling the girl i don t care if you have a boyfriend or not i m going to have fun either way again having fun should be one of your primary motives when you go out else fear may take you over and you will take rejections seriously and most likely give up read get a girl to go home with you for more third example when a girl is rude or meanly rejects you then instead of reacting channel the reaction into something constructive or fun like bow down as you leave or approach another girl immediately etc instead of dwelling on the reaction from rejection you can also say something like i am just going to tuck in my tail and go talk to that girl or you can simply express what you are feeling by saying something like man that hurts or i knew it you are so tall and good looking girl with a huge vanity or i will just leave i don t want to handle your ego or i can see your future pushing the stroller at grocery store with bunch of cats in it it s therapeutic and vulnerable when you truthfully express your mental emotional state and or just channel your reactions in a fun creative and constructive way 10 x research source of course with common sense reactions are not you but conditioned mental emotional patterns don t take them too seriously read dissolve the ego according to eckhart tolle s teachings for more depth when you realize that you are not your thoughts reactions and emotions you naturally become more non reactive also more you fail at something more likely you are going to succeed at it 11 x research source manson mark subtle art of not giving a f ck pg 156 it s also called the fail fast mentality more non reaction practices are mentioned in section 4 so don t react as in the long run you may realize that rejections or failures can be equally if not more valuable experiences than desired responses read become mentally flexible for more no experience goes waste behind every seemingly bad situation lies concealed a deeper good and that deeper good reveals itself to you through inner acceptance to what is 12 x research source tolle eckhart i stillness speaks i vancouver bc namaste publishing 2003 page 56 eckhart tolle also reactions drain you of energy and as a result you may not be able to practice for long a practical pointer if you react then you may most likely feel uncomfortable when you go about talking to other girls because you just reacted at a girl at the same venue also in western society women are more likely to be believed than men again polarize subtly and slowly to quickly filter out those girls women with whom you will not be compatible with so they don t get offended too much and you don t have to deal with symptoms like this she is good to people who are good she is also good to people who aren t good this is true goodness tao te ching since facts are empowering here s a factual pointer doesn t matter how scarily beautiful they look their physical beauty or body just like yours is subjected to the law of impermanence which means in few years it will wrinkle grow frail and then turn to dust just like your body will turn to dust with this realization comes a playfulness and devaluation of forms and looks 13 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 210 this of course doesn t mean to not care for your body infact when you truly realize the transient nature of all forms you honor and enjoy them even more practice being funny a good sense of humor is on the top of list of qualities of an attractive person as its not only sub communicates that you don t take life seriously but is also intelligent plus its magnetic why do good funny shows or stand ups or movies attract such a large audience if you don t know how to be funny then watch standups funny videos or shows go through funny content etc use apps like ifunny and youtube there is funny and informative content that is posted regularly on these apps that you can use in your own life situation the content on these apps can help you fix the problem of running out of interesting funny and witty things to say however do not use sense of humor as a mask to avoid rejection rejections are unavoidable if you practice non reaction being funny and making deep genuine connections with women or people in general then the below conversation practices are no more than supplements to boost your conversation and social skills use us mentality it s a quite persuasive conversation tool to keep the girl engaged and can make both of you feel comfortable pretty quickly it means making the conversation about both of you rather than you or the girl for example if she says she likes the video game series sims you can reply with something like you know we should play sims game at my place i ll order pizza and you can bring the soda we can build a home together with a garden full of lilies and sh t also what color of paint we should use to paint the room for our baby it s like bringing her into your world or bubble you made for both of you don t be too serious as you could end up pushing her away but again be honest with your intentions use the us mentality in accordance with your personality and humor or else it s not going to come out as genuine experiment to get a better understanding of your humor and personality you could try using sexual plain lame or sarcastic humor in your conversations to see if you find it funny if the girl finds it fun too that s what helps make a good connection remember it s about you and not the girls you always have to put yourself first by talking and doing things that you like it sounds selfish but it s not it s because when you are having fun then in the long run people in your company will also have fun if they are compatible with your personality 14 x research source manson mark models attracting women through honesty pg 42 use roleplay this means you both play roles in an imaginary scenario created by you read the conversation in the image to get a better idea make it sexual if your motive is to have sex with the girl then sexual hints are quite essential some of these practices may come in handy to create sexual energy think about having sex while talking to girls women this charges the conversation with sexual energy be careful to avoid getting lost in fantasizing and or getting an erection use sexual humor with common sense during conversations without forcing it let it come naturally as if you are having a normal conversation with a friend read get a girl to go home with you for more show intent with body language while interacting with a girl try leaning in a little closer touch her sub communicate your intentions with facial gestures etc don t force it though let it come naturally keep a strong eye contact it s quite effective to keep a strong eye contact your eye contact should be piercing her soul as the expression goes physical escalation this is gold if you can learn how to do it properly it works best during the night time although its fine to do it in daytime in moderation read make out with a random girl and pull a girl home for more details stop masturbating abstaining from masturbation or at least reducing the frequency helps naturally build sexual energy within you that surfaces during your interactions keep in mind that this may or may not work for you also if and when you masturbate think of your sexual experiences or fantasies rather than masturbating to porn this helps improve your imagination and doesn t let you to use porn as a crutch relying on pornography can be a destructive habit that can affect your sex and personal life

verbal examples you look cute pull but you don t seem to be my type push here put your number in my phone pull but promise me you won t call me again and again push let s go to my place pull but promise you won t touch me below my waist push you forgot my name go away i don t wanna talk to you push however i forgot your name too pull here are some physical examples while making out push at the right moment when her craving for you is the highest this will make her want you even more while touching the girl don t go for her breasts or vagina push instead gently touch around other areas pull know the difference between persistence and supplication persistence is when you continue to persuade or pull the girl into a conversation when the girl woman seems interested but is bound by social conditioning yes and maybe girls signs could be laughing at your average jokes trying to walk away but still not leaving smiling keeping a longer eye contact than usual playing with her hair giving vague answers when you ask for her number or going for a beverage etc use common sense while looking for these signs though if she is serious move on there are plenty of women read get a girl to go home with you for more tips on this keep it simple if a girl is not properly replying to you or your texts or calling back take the hint that she s not interested or has other priorities there may be no need to continuously persist move on yes some girls do like to play games but in the long run you may realize how irrational and futile they are although keep in mind some girls may be genuinely busy so as a guideline its ok to contact them once or twice a few days after your last text experiment with your approach pickup is very subjective as you meet many different people who all have vastly different personalities mental interpretations to things conditioning humor and list goes on for example suppose telling a joke to a girl martha makes her laugh and telling the same joke to another girl anna creeps her out does this mean that martha is cooler than anna perhaps there could be many reasons for their different reactions a few of them could be your personality and sense of humor resonates better with martha as the joke was polarizing anna could be in a bad mood didn t like you or the joke didn t like your physical appearance likes taller guys likes guys her own race thinks you smell bad doesn t like to crack jokes with random strangers is insecure or has irrational beliefs realizes you were not confident enough for her maybe you didn t groom well saw that you are not wearing good clothes is a no girl etc you have no control over other people s reactions actions personality and mood and if you worried about it you will just suffer even your own thoughts and emotions are not in your control they are automatic and conditioned read how to become mentally flexible and how to surrender to the present moment for more depth so work only on the key practices or habits as mentioned in the article and related articles that are in your direct control read become mentally flexible for more for example dress well groom and smell good work out speak with confidence and assertiveness learn from your audio recordings keep focused eye contact stop girls properly keep an observation journal be nonreactive meditate keep some attention with in inner body or breath make a deep connection correct your body posture have fun etc try new things practicing pickup as an experiment means you can try new things as test cases and just observe their outcome like a good scientist without any emotional or mental interpretations let the true unconditioned interpretation come naturally and you will clearly see what works and what doesn t work for you tao te ching says a good scientist has freed himself of concepts and keeps his mind open to what is for example if you learned that maintaining eye contact during interaction builds attraction then don t just reject or accept it right away use it as an experiment test case practice maintaining a gentle and focused eye contact in all of your approaches and observe the outcome like a good scientist don t get identified with the outcome this may go on for some days or be over after a few approaches it will depend on your personality your openness to try new things your humility depth and learning curve like a successful scientific discovery is adopted by people on a larger scale integrate what you discover into your game be aware of the mental constructs a construct like when i keep a strong eye contact girls seem to be pretty attracted to me so if i keep doing that i will get same or similar results all the time would be another mind made concept made in a futile attempt to understand the world through mind it s fine to use concepts in the beginning or from time to time but as you go along you shouldn t cling to concepts as they fragment the reality so a truly intelligent and intuitive

unconsciously or subconsciously as a result people may find you threatening even though in reality you may be a nice person yes there is a possibility that they may find you threatening because of their irrational beliefs or stereotypes this may make you perceive yourself the same way like a mirror although deeply realize that the primary reality is within so you need to make these conditioned patterns conscious and realize them as not who you are to go beyond this loop read become mentally flexible for more depth most of these irrational and negative beliefs exist because of identification with personal and cultural conditioning misinterpretations i e identification with mind 18 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste

thought that comes before approaching girls that says what s the point she s going to reject me anyway or she s going to frown on me then test the validity of these beliefs via experimentation this means when you approach a girl simply observe if it s really the case when the evidence suggests otherwise that s what helps to dissolve these self limiting beliefs don t just stop after a few approaches as mentioned above it depends on your personality openness and level of awareness to add more evidence think of any experiences when girls have been receptive and interested in you this

a girl rejects you and you say see i knew she will reject me this means there was an unconscious expectation attached to it this implies that your mind is more open to evidence that would support the belief rather than seeing the subtle truth of the situation again like a good scientist be very honest open to what is and just observe without any attachment or expectation in other words be there as the background awareness without adding any interpretation to anything these unconscious beliefs however slight or subtle or deep seated can survive in you for decades and continue to reflect in your

which is actually most effective to dissolve self limiting and negative beliefs this also implies to deeply realize that you are not your mind thoughts emotions and reactions but the one who allows it to be that s when your true power shines through you get another opinion while observing your recordings an unbiased third person wouldn t care whether you do good or bad he she would just observe there is a strong identification in the word i and its forms in the sentences i failed the test or she failed the test which would be more distressing and yet they are no more than thoughts or concepts in your head alternatively you can simply ask the girls if they find anything about you that could be improved you will be surprised how many of them tell you however just because they have a vagina doesn t automatically make them de facto expert about dating and pickup also girls usually are not a good authority to tell why they like or don t like certain things 22 x research source manson mark models attracting women through honesty pg 89 here s an analogy you don t ask fishes about how to catch a fish you ask the fisherman keep a journal after practicing pickup jot down the good things and things you need to improve in a journal you cannot always record yourself so keeping a journal can be quite yielding to become more aware of the mistakes and good things you have been doing during your interactions or we can say to become more aware of the truth you can also make voice recordings of your mental notes read the notes in the image for a better idea find your demographics as mentioned everyone is different have different personality passions and interpretations so it helps immensely to go to places where there is a higher possibility of finding like minded

going to meditation events facilitate the events or instead of going to libraries organize book clubs events where you can share your thoughts about books and of course meet girls this doesn t mean that you shouldn t go to places like bars events or outdoor clubs you can still meet cool people there and practice social skills as almost all people have more than one interest but your chances may not be high so keep a balance again its not always about getting girls but going out consistently helps you in other life aspects like public speaking dissolving irrational fears and social anxiety

emotions to present moment anchors or channel it out by making the situation fun and silly for example you can say to yourself or girls something like i am feeling dead inside or i am being a vagina

having a good balance between these three aspects is important to get good at pickup as all these aspects are interconnected and back each other up people who maintain a good balance between these aspects have a good potential to quickly get good at pickup as they will easily be able to connect the dots between these areas and sub areas for example people who have a good social life are more likely to be confident and successful while lack in one of the aspects would most likely affect the other two in the long run for instance if you are investing too much time in making money wealth and working out health there is a good possibility that your social life relationship may suffer which may affect your wealth and health emotional and physical in the long run similarly if you have the right amount of wealth but don t have good social life or health then it may eventually affect your wealth but if you completely accept the lack in one or more of these aspects that could work for you too this can also work like a priming effect 26 x research source this means if you are spending a lot of time just doing pickup you may realize the importance of relationships health and wealth in

looks status race and wealth matter let s clear this up yes they matter and if someone says otherwise they are lying or don t know in some cases they matter more and in others not as much for example in western countries girls generally find white guys to be more attractive as compared to other races yes its harder for non white guys in western world but at the same time if you simply accept it without any reservations then it can also work to your advantage and can potentially help you access inner timeless beauty within in other words you become less dependent on fleeting looks also when

how to choose a loyal partner,perhaps one of the most valuable assets you can have in a romantic relationship is loyalty you may be struggling to find a partner who is loyal and reliable especially when confronted with a difficult situation or a tricky relationship issue or you may already be with someone but are unsure if they are loyal and have what it takes to be your life partner you can choose a partner who is loyal by looking at how they behave you should also consider how you interact together as a couple and watch for any red flags that indicate the person is not as loyal as they could be,notice if the person is reliable and honest you should consider the individual traits of your partner or a person who may be a partner to you in the future one of the key traits you should look for is reliability and honesty ask yourself does this person appear reliable and honest and how does this person demonstrate they are reliable and honest 1 x research source for example you may notice that the person shows up when they say they are going to and does not flake out at the last minute on plans you have together you may also notice that the person does not cheat on tests or exams even though they might get away with it this is an indication that they have a strong moral compass and will not simply take the easy route if it means less work for them consider if the person is supportive of you a loyal partner will honor your individual traits and skills you should note if the person shows clear support for your interests and goals having a partner who is supportive also shows that they are interested in you as a person and care about your future for example you may notice that the person always shows up to your games or matches or makes every effort to be there maybe the person takes on extra duties at home so you have time to study for an exam or time to spend on an important project for work you may also note that the person tells you directly i support you and think what you are doing is great or i believe in you and your abilities i want to support you in every way i can determine if the person is emotionally mature emotional maturity is a key trait in a relationship as it indicates that the person is comfortable in their own skin and willing to be there for you emotionally being emotionally mature is a good indicator of loyalty and a good sign that your relationship is healthy 2 x research source for example an emotionally mature person will be a good listener and put their needs aside to focus on your needs they will also be comfortable talking about their feelings wants and needs with you and be willing to ask for what they want an emotionally mature person will also be able to make their own decisions and choices without the influence of others this is a good trait to have as it shows that they can be accountable for their own choices and be responsible with their decisions determine what loyalty means to you take some time to think about what loyalty looks like to you look at the obvious things as well as more subtle situations does loyalty mean not cheating emotionally physically both not talking about private matters with others showing up to company events collaborating on financial decisions prior to purchases checking in before committing to plans what exactly are you expecting from a partner when you use the term loyal you need to have a clear idea of what these behaviors are in order to look for them in others and have a conversation about them talk to your partner about what is important to you instead assuming your definition of loyalty matches your partner s have a discussion about which behaviors indicate loyalty to you for instance your partner showing up to your soccer match may be a demonstration of loyalty in your eyes but maybe your partner doesn t mind if you don t go to their events so they don t realize how important it is to you that they go to your events take the time to express which behaviors are important and which meet your needs for a relationship and allow your partner to do the same look at how you handle conflict when trying to determine if you have chosen a loyal partner you should consider how you handle conflict in your relationship are you both able to talk about any issues or problems you may be having can you speak openly about how you feel with your partner having good communication skills and listening skills are important aspects of a fulfilling loyal relationship 3 x research source you may also think about how your partner handles conflict between you do they get upset and shut down are they able to talk to you about their feelings and concerns note how they react in difficult or challenging situations and whether you feel they react in a healthy honest way consider if you trust each other you should also take a moment to consider if you can place your complete trust in that person and if they can do the same with you ask yourself can i trust in this person completely if the answer is no or maybe you should consider why you are hesitant to trust your partner you may write down why you cannot answer yes to the question and consider if the reasons for no are not fixable or able to addressed with your partner 4 x research source for example you may write down that you cannot trust your partner because they are not honest with you about their feelings you may then consider talking with your partner about being more open and honest with their feelings communicating with them about your concerns may help you learn how to trust them in the future think about how your relationship has progressed you should also look at the big picture and consider your relationship as a whole think about where your relationship started and where it is at now does it feel like you and your partner have grown and matured together does your relationship feel stronger now than it did in the past if your relationship is healthy your sense of loyalty for your partner should expand over time and you should feel you can trust them after so much time together 5 x research source if you feel your relationship has not developed as much as you hoped it would in terms of trust and loyalty you may decide to talk to your partner about how you are feeling you should consider what you can both do to prioritize your relationship and develop a stronger sense of loyalty look at how the person treats their friends and family you can tell a lot about a person s loyalty based on how they treat those they love and those closest to them consider if your partner is loyal and honest with their family and their friends or if they are flaky and unreliable a loyal person will treat those closest to them with respect admiration and consideration it may be a red flag if your partner is not as supportive or considerate of those closest to them as they could be for example you should consider if the person treats their friends with loyalty and consideration do they try to support their friends in their endeavors do they try to spend time with their friends and follow through on their commitments to their friends you should also consider how your partner treats their family though they may not be close to their family they may still go out of their way to help a family member in need or try to support a family member who is suffering or having a hard time determine if the person follows through on their commitments you should also consider if the person is able to commit to things and follow through on their word this is an important indicator of loyal and reliable behavior you want a partner who is not flaky or unable to commit to anything as it could be a sign they have a hard time being loyal to those around them 6 x research source for example you may notice that the person is good at texting people back and responding to messages from friends who are in need they may also make plans with friends or coworkers and then make sure they always show up and put in an effort you may also note that the person is able to commit to short term plans and long term plans with you perhaps you make dinner plans for next week and the person makes sure they can make it you may also plan a vacation in a few months and note that the person makes sure they are able to go with you before they commit check that the person sets boundaries with others you should pay attention to how the person interacts with others and ensure they are good at setting boundaries having boundaries is an important part of being loyal as you want a partner who is able to be friendly but not too flirty with others if the person tends to get too close to friends or coworkers and is not good at saying no this may be a red flag 7 x research source your partner should be aware of when they are stepping over the line and possibly breaking your trust by spending too much time with someone else or by devoting too much emotion to another person if you express concern about their relationship with someone else they should listen to your concerns and try to show you that you have nothing to worry about for example you should note if your partner is able to have relationships with the opposite sex or the sex they are attracted to without ending up getting too flirty or too close this could be someone they work with or a close friend they should be able to maintain friendly platonic relationships with others and also devote enough time to your relationship note if the person has cheated before you should also consider if your partner has cheated in the past with other partners a person who has a history of cheating may have difficulty with commitment and monogamy you should think about if you are concerned about your partner s loyalty because of their track record with other partners and view this as a red flag 8 x research source if you have some concerns about your partner s loyalty you should speak to them about trust and commitment your partner should try to assure you that they can be loyal to you and show you that they can be loyal you may also ask them to show you that they can be trusted and will not cheat on you like they did with their other partners in the past,Relationships

deal etc never pressure the other person with regards to sex or expect it to happen within a certain time frame allow it to occur naturally you may have to wait several dates for it to even be a possibility be patient and give them plenty of space after your first date continue with your other activities and make it clear that you have a life beyond dating because you do the idea is to

how to know if a woman is a cougar,cougars are popularly defined as women in their 40s or older who date significantly younger men generally at a 10 year age gap or more pop culture paints the cougar as predatory and pathetically desperate but women have recently begun fighting the stereotype real cougars they argue are confident successful single women over the age of 40 who tired of unromantic and narrow minded men their own age date younger more active and more adventurous men 1 x research source 2 x research source this article offers tips on identifying and attracting a cougar also and preferably known as an older woman,forget everything you think you know about cougars in fact forget the term all together if you are interested in dating and or having a romantic encounter with an older woman you ll need to treat her like a human being not some sexist stereotype of how a sexually active older woman looks and behaves determine the woman s age the generally accepted age group for cougars is 40 plus however some people go as low as 35 in their definition with new creams and procedures available many men and women are able to look much younger than they are some things you can look for which apply to both sexes 3 x research source dry dull and or thinning hair both men and women experience a decrease in the quality of their hair as they get older you might notice that an older woman has brittle looking hair that lacks the shine and fullness of younger people her hair might also be dyed to cover grey hairs 4 x research source sparse eyebrows and eyelashes as we age our hormones drop and hair growth slows which can make our eyebrows and eyelashes less lush some women might opt for pencilled or tattooed eyebrows and eyelash extensions so it still might be difficult to judge their age based on these factors alone thinner lips and eroded tooth enamel our lips wrinkle and thin with age and our teeth wear down and erode you might notice thin lines around an older woman s mouth thinner lips maybe partly hidden with lipliner and duller or translucent teeth thin skin as men and women get older the smooth skin on their necks gain ridges and wrinkles unless they use botox or have a face lifts that is thin skin will also be apparent on the hands making veins knuckles and tendons more visible dry and saggy knees and elbows with age the skin around our knees and elbows begins to dry and sag around the joints the skin around the elbows in particular can become darker and much drier than the surrounding skin evaluate her makeup evolutionary psychology has shown that when evaluating women s desirability physical attractiveness is a more important factor than it is in evaluating men s desirability 5 x research source this means that while less attractive men might still be desirable based on their intelligence humor income etc women are still largely judged on how they look for this reason it makes sense that with age a woman might amp up her makeup routine to try to hide the signs of aging that will make her less desirable you might notice an older woman wearing more foundation and structuring creams and shades to help give her face a smooth contoured look she might also be more likely to wear lipliner to make her lips look fuller a brow pencil to fill in her eyebrows and blush to make her cheeks look more youthful and rosy contouring is a popular makeup technique right now used by women in all age groups from their teens upward don t think you can judge her by her fashion sense the comical cougar stereotype is of a woman wearing clothes that are much too young and often too tight for her usually in tacky fabrics such as animal print the reality is that women of any age can dress in a tasteless and unflattering manner how a woman dresses regardless of her age depends largely upon her own personal sense of style while women of all ages wear push up bras older women may find them even more useful as their breasts will sag with age pay attention to her self confidence in general the older a woman gets the better she knows herself and what she likes and the more confident she becomes some signs that she is confident 6 x research source good posture whether sitting or standing a person with good self confidence will likely have a straight back and a head that is well balanced on the neck with the chin pointed neither

peace with herself she won t be very fidgety eye contact confident people make eye contact and maintain it in social interactions that said there s a difference between maintaining eye contact and staring intimidatingly at someone looking someone in the eye roughly 60 of the time you are talking to them is a good rule of thumb know what you want and be honest about it whether it s just sex or a long term relationship knowing what you want will help you figure out your best course of action to get it it s also important to be honest with the woman about what you want don t act like you want a relationship if all you want is sex women enjoy sex too she might be fine with some no strings attached fun some questions to consider is it sexual a checkmark on your bucket list or are you interested in something long term with someone who is more mature than your previous partners perhaps you have someone specific in mind already and are wondering how you can get her to notice you if you just want sex with an older woman for example your best bet might be dating sites geared specifically toward older women seeking younger men and vice versa there are even cruises devoted to connecting older women with younger men 7 x research source dating sites are also a good option if you are seeking a longer term relationship with an older woman again just be clear about your intentions from the beginning women in and over the age of 40 have lives too this means that you can meet them literally anywhere from the gym to a boating club to an acting class or even in your local grocery store spaces are shared interest are great for meeting people in general no matter your age forget the stereotype sure some older women might fit the traditional cougar stereotype but just as many if not more will not as with all people desires and behaviour differ depending on the individual when approaching an older woman for romantic purposes you ll do well to forget the cougar stereotype and simply treat her with the same respect and consideration that you would treat anyone else some websites would have you believe that there are specific types of cougar the moneyed cougar or sugar mama the angry cougar the sweet cougar alpha versus beta cougars 8 x research source 9 x research source while there is often some truth in stereotypes you re better off getting to know the individual woman rather than trying to lock her into some predefined narrow minded and generally unflattering idea of how a mature woman behaves show her you re interested if you re interested in a mature woman let her know how you show you re interested will vary depending on your own situation including where you meet the woman and how well you already know her if you meet a woman at the bar you might show your interest by smiling at her and seeing if she smiles back wait to see if she keeps looking back at you if she does this might be a sign that she s interested you could then approach her and ask to buy her a drink if you are interested in a woman who is in the same running club as you your tactic would be different you might gauge her interest by starting a conversation with her after the run it doesn t have to be anything too serious small talk about the weather and the run will do to begin with be prepared for rejection and take it gracefully if you approach a mature woman and she rejects you don t be a jerk about it it s okay to be disappointed and to even express your disappointment in a polite or witty manner it s not okay to call her names or threaten her do i m devastated but if you change your mind i ll be over there don t are you kidding me you re lucky to have a young guy like me show interest in you be young if you are trying to attract an older woman don t get stuck on the idea that you need to act like a man their age might act many women in their 40s admit to seeking younger men because they are more open minded adventurous and romantic when going out on dates be adventurous and willing to try new things share your interests with her and learn about her interests too as with any relationship take pleasure in learning and growing together you ll also benefit from being adventurous and open minded in the bedroom chances are she ll be clear about what she likes so it s important that you re willing to listen and possibly follow instructions be honest about who you are if a mature woman says that her last relationship ended because her partner was an unromantic stubborn workaholic and you know that you re approaching a critical time in your career where you will need to prioritize work over everything else it might not be the best time to get into a relationship with this woman be reliable and uncomplicated most older women and men have had enough relationships to know what works and what doesn t they re not interested in playing games cancelling plans at the last minute and forgetting to call for days to weeks might have been tolerated by younger women but more mature women will likely not put up with this behaviour 10 x research source,Relationships

of you are compatible your relationship will develop soon enough don t start talking about marriage or starting a family before you ve even met their close friends and parents raising such issues prematurely can create tension from the outset and may stall or even bring to an end an otherwise productive and caring relationship don t feel the need to show off or impress them you don t need to prove anything to them you simply need to be present and engaged in listening being attentive and sharing your interests be honest while being honest to your partner is very important to the point of being paramount it is equally important that you are honest with yourself if you overreact or make a mistake you can acknowledge your error and apologize if you re feeling vulnerable or upset you can sort through your feelings and verbalize them to them in a non accusing way 2 x research source and the most important thing here is that you will be open about your feelings as much as possible for

ll know sooner rather than later whether this relationship will endure or fizzle out speak your mind don t be afraid to make your desires needs and opinions known even when they may conflict with your partners you don t and shouldn t exist solely to please them besides showing that you are your own person with your own needs desires and approach to life will keep them interested in getting to know and understand you as a person if you re comfortable with speaking your mind then they ll be comfortable with speaking their mind too 3 x research source just remember to express yourself in way that doesn t attack anyone else s opinion or lifestyle in any way you can be humble and outspoken at the same time by using assertiveness strategies and remaining considerate of their feelings too be yourself don t create a fake you just to impress them it might be tempting if you think they d prefer a different type of girl but usually this is just cobbling together snippets of things said or suggested and you re likely to be wrong after all they want to date you not some imagined form of perfection and if you really feel tempted to change things about yourself because they insist that you d be better thinner taller prettier quieter whatever then it s a good indication that you re not compatible if they actually say such things to you in a badgering persistent manner then it is not love but an attempt to control you don t pretend that you share their interests if you don t it might be amusing or safe to do so initially but it s extremely hurtful when they learn that you don t really love what they love they could be basing their thoughts about your role in their future on something that isn t real and it ll end up hurting both of you take an interest in their interests remember what they like to do and what they like to talk about you don t have to act like you love their hobbies but at least try to understand why they re such a fan if they love a band try to understand why if they just love to be playful and immature remember that it might just be their way of releasing stress in learning to accept their unique way of being you ll also be learning more about yourself and ultimately whether you could see yourself spending the rest of your life with this person 4 x research source you don t have to take an interest in all of their interests if they enjoy watching baseball but you just can t get into it that s fine too just asking about their interests and talking about the things that matter to them can be enough learn to work as a team as in any healthy relationship you ll experience your share of conflicts some tiny some big remember to be true to yourself and try to abandon any significant selfishness a relationship is a matter of teamwork and a symbiotic relationship not a parasitic one where a party gives and the other one just takes without giving enough back in a team you have each other s back you don t undermine one another and you openly cherish each other in front of others 5 x research source in times of hardship a team approach can help you to work through problems in a less emotionally attached way in that both of you

strong by bringing variety and diversity into the relationship try different and new things together relationships are about having fun together learning together and growing together compliment them more than you criticize them if everything you say around them is a criticism or an attack they won t look forward to seeing you and they ll start reconsidering being with you all the same you don t always have to agree with them just because they are your partner tactfulness is a better strategy in mature relationships and establishing boundaries and making compromises are important relationship strategies to learn and adopt 6 x research source though you can bring up a valid criticism when it feels right you should say at least four positive things about them for every negative thing you say don t nag them just because you re in a bad mood or things aren t going perfectly learn to compromise if you want to be a good girlfriend then you have to learn to compromise instead of fighting or being angry the second you don t get your way to compromise well you both have to be able to calmly and rationally discuss a situation while understanding the other person s perspective try to understand where your significant other is coming from instead of blindly focusing on what you think you need 7 x research source you don t want to be that girl who always gets her way just because your partner would rather give in than stand their ground because you get so angry and upset whenever things don t go your way give each other space you should support your partner but you should also

your partner 8 x research source they should know that you re thinking of them and rooting for them even if you re not around if you feel insecure and doubt the strength of your relationship the

overly protective girlfriend let them go out without them feeling watched remember that they don t need you for everything and that you are separate people as well as a couple when they need some space don t take it personally recognize it for what it is their time to rejuvenate and to share different interests with others but do make sure they know that you re always there for them be affectionate there are various ways to show your affection some are more obvious than others and the way you approach this will depend on how openly affectionate you like to be personally affection is

bear especially in public of all things good communication is the vital part of any relationship so make sure that they know how much you like them regular lovey dovey texts and emails can be a plus

video of your song to youtube don t get jealous you should be loving but not to the point where you start seeing red the second your partner talks to or even just mentions another girl nothing will turn your significant other off faster than a girlfriend who is so insecure that she can t stand the thought of other women existing in the universe your partner will appreciate you even more if you re nice to their female friends instead of talking about how ugly or annoying any girl you see is 12 x research source if they re out with their friends don t text them every two seconds to make sure

about your partner s nudism from others if it makes you uncomfortable or causes you stress simply say ned s a great guy and we don t need to talk about his lifestyle schedule me time having time to yourself is an important part of any relationship and maintaining your well being make sure you have plenty of me time to get your mind off of any stress or discomfort you feel with your partner s

how to cold approach a girl,so you ve spotted a girl out in public that you want to get to know but you don t know how maybe you re shy or considered socially awkward by most or maybe just not really into the whole dating game and don t really know how to approach someone that you re attracted to cold approaching anyone can be a tough process especially if you re unsure of how to start a conversation however it s possible to cold approach a girl and have the interaction go fairly smoothly,understand women while it can be quite tough to understand women even for women themselves gaining an understanding of women and how they think is vital to approaching them in any way everyone s heard the stories of trying and failing to impress a stranger that you want to get to know and effectively ruin your chances if you want to be able to effectively cold approach a girl and have the approach go smoothly it s crucial to understand her beforehand while there s no way of generalizing women and how they think there are a few things you can recall to improve your chance of the cold approach going well 1 x research source many women prefer long term relationships over hookups and can tell which one a guy wants chances are if you approach a girl solely to have sex with her she ll know what you re up to arrogance and playing yourself up to be manlier than you really are will backfire as many women are interested in people who care about the feelings of others she ll also discover it eventually if you were faking masculinity women are often emotion based so it s important to be sensitive and put yourself in her shoes if you say something rude she won t appreciate it while many women want to find a partner they often prefer friendships first it s best to approach a girl with the intent of making a friend not getting a date tune up your social skills while it s important to have some social skills before approaching anyone women in particular have some finer social nuances than others may pick up on there are exceptions of course but many women prefer to be treated respectfully and as though they re being approached for more than just how they look while it takes a lot more than just knowing how to have a good conversation to tune up your social skills here are a few things to keep in mind when approaching girls for a conversation 2 x research source avoid calling women terms like b tches sl ts wh res or any other terms considered derogatory towards women avoid swearing as well this will turn many girls away from you don t comment on her body unless you re out at a club you re not going to get a girl to want to go anywhere with you if the first thing you comment on is her breasts or butt or any other part of her for that matter as you may creep her out try to avoid commenting on her body especially with your opening lines there s a fine line between flirting and sexual harassment however nobody likes to be sexually harassed a woman who looks uncomfortable towards your sexual advances or asks you to stop does not want you to keep making those comments and you may be sexually harassing her show respect above all treating anyone male or female like they re lesser than you will not only make you seem callous and dismissive but it will also drive most people away from you girls included when they see how you treat others be confident it s very important that you are confident confidence is not only attractive but also gives you courage to approach and carry out a conversation with a girl you just met thinking negatively and bashing yourself for mistakes you ve made in previous cold approaches doesn t help just use those experiences to prepare yourself for now show that you re sure of what you re doing and that you don t doubt yourself many people love others who are confident 3 x research source don t worry about what people will think of you yes it s a cliché but there will always be people who ll dislike you and what you do a big part of confidence is living the way you want to despite whether or not it s the way others want you to live if you stop focusing so much on what other people think of you including the girls you re approaching it ll make you much happier and more confident 4 x research source be aware that some people may have very valid concerns so at least take the time to listen to them and consider them in particular if female friends or family members are giving you warnings take note and heed them girls often know what other girls like and don t like know that you re taking a chance but it s not a big one if you re nervous about cold approaching a girl you may ruminate about what ifs such as what if i catch her at a bad moment or what if she s rude and calls me a name remember though you can t read her mind you don t know how she might react when you approach her so you have to be willing to take risks being afraid to approach girls just because of the what ifs may prevent you from approaching girls and seeing if any of those what ifs are actually true keep the benefits in mind this is a method which is out of the norm and could be scary that s one of the reasons the benefits are great think about it it helps you overcome fear which gives you a deep inner confidence and therefore sets the stage for you to become a more confident person who can move forward easily and if it goes well you get to meet a new person who could potentially become your friend or even girlfriend be comfortable in your own skin yes you have negative traits but so does everybody else and it doesn t do you any good to pick yourself apart or mull over your flaws so what if you have a stutter your clothes don t match the trends of what most girls seem to like or you don t have a fantastic job that makes it possible for you to go out to fancy five star restaurants with others a girl who s worth befriending or dating will accept you for who you are even if you can t necessarily know what kind of person she is when you cold approach her know that if she s the right person for you she ll accept you despite your flaws this doesn t necessarily mean that you shouldn t work on things that are in your control your grooming habits for example are within your control and are important to control a girl won t be very inclined to talk to you if you haven t showered or worn deodorant in three days and your shirt is covered in old pizza grease stains understand that rejection can and will happen while not everyone will reject you and rejection doesn t define your worth it s very possible that at some point a girl will reject you when this happens take it in stride apologize if she seems offended or creeped out and take some time away to let the awkwardness

something you know about you can say something about that such as nice shirt you watch that tv show too steer clear of questions that can be answered with a yes or no response since it s hard to continue a conversation with most of those have good body language how you present yourself is very important when it comes to having a good conversation having open body language is crucial as you

talking don t think about the next thing you re going to say if you zone out you only prove to her that you don t think whatever she s talking about is something you re going to listen to 11 x research source don t cross your arms or legs or put anything in front of you as this is a sign of being disinterested and closed off it s often seen as barricading yourself gauge her interest you don

all you can use to judge how interested she is things like openness about herself whether she focuses all her attention on the conversation and how much she s talking can be indicators of how interested she is a conversation isn t a solo act she has to be contributing too open body language a genuine smile laughter and carrying on the conversation without having to be prompted are signs that she s fairly comfortable 12 x research source if she s smiling uncomfortably not making eye contact facing her body away from you or giving monotone one word answers she s most likely not interested wrap up the conversation thank her for her time and move on carry on the conversation she may be someone you don t know but she very likely hangs out with her friends has hobbies works studies has a life story family music movies has other interests and so forth these things should be enough to make you feel curious about her finding out more about her can be a great way of getting to know her and keeping the conversation going simultaneously getting her to talk about herself is key to finding out more about her and thus finding new avenues of conversation learn about her interests asking her what she likes to do for fun is a good start if you saw her doing something that could be seen as a hobby e g you met her at the gym or saw her painting something it s also great

yourself don t lie she ll find out eventually and no good relationship is built on a lie obviously use common sense avoid using profanity before she does and never make sexual comments about her or other girls ask her on an instant date or make plans for the future if the conversation is going well and you re both having fun then ask her out for a coffee or beverage it doesn t have to be a big proposal a simple have you got anything to do after this i was wondering if you wanted to go for a coffee afterwards can work magic if she says that she s busy immediately afterwards try to arrange a time when you can see each other again noncommittal answers or not making concrete plans to meet you as well as constantly sidestepping making plans e g she always has something to do on every suggested date and time is a sign that she s not interested in seeing you again and that you shouldn t press the matter any further get her phone number if the conversation is going well ask for her phone number and call her later for example you seem like someone i would like to get to know better how about we exchange numbers and talk sometime later don t necessarily wait for the end of your conversation to ask her for the phone number do it when you feel you have reached a very powerful connection with her during the conversation and it just feels the right moment to do so it s called window of opportunity use it wisely 13 x research source call or text her within the next day or two of meeting her this is very important as the more you delay contacting her the more likely she s going to forget who you are and lessen your chances of seeing her again calling her instead of texting may be more effective since it not only reflects someone who is confident but it s more personal than texting and also provides an opportunity where you both can start a conversation from where you left off wrap up the conversation well even if the approach has gone wonderfully and you both feel like you could spend the entire day talking to each other the conversation does have to end at some point and it s important to leave her wanting more when it s time to go tell her that you ve enjoyed talking with her and if the conversation went well ask her for her phone number or make plans for meeting again cold approaching is all about making a good impression and it s important to leave her

hands or get cozy if you can read your date you may see your date s own strong signals that he or she wouldn t mind you getting closer for an intimate snuggle this can help you pluck up the courage needed choose the right time and place there are wrong times such as when he s slurping his linguine with clam sauce or she s trying on a pair of shoes and there are right times to sneak your arm around your date choose an intimate moment and exercise patience the right time will present itself in due course perfect arm sneaking times include at the movies during a romantic sad or scary point

move at the same time such as saying you know that i find you so adorable while sliding your arm around his or her back at the same time or go window shopping together and as your date is peering at something closely sidle up and mention how interesting the items in the window appear while at the same time sneaking your arm around your date s back make it fun try this on for size ask your date if you were a pirate would you have a parrot on this shoulder point to the shoulder closest to you or this shoulder point the shoulder furthest from you when your hand reaches the shoulder furthest from

cheek you get the drift have courage but don t go over the top if you re certain that it s the right time and place then go with your instinct and trust that your date is ready for the arm sneak on the other hand if your date shrinks back asks that you kindly remove your arm or looks horrified then it s either too soon or it s never going to happen be polite and remove your arm with a short apology and simply move on by suggesting that the two of you do something else the implications of the response may be something you need to reflect on and you may even need to discuss the future of your relationship after some reflection choose the right place this move can be made at the movies in a bar wherever you re seated together etc wait for your date to appear at ease this includes signs of having settled in comfortably not talking too much nerves and enjoying the occasion start yawning bring your hand up to your mouth to stifle the yawn follow the covered yawn action with a stretch

14 x research source before you take any kind of action consider the source the way you handle a person using sexting to blackmail you will be different than telling your partner or friend that their text messages simply make you uncomfortable consider why the sexting upsets you it might be the source of the messages such as from a friend or acquaintance rather than from a lover and or it just feels too intimate for your preference or it might be the content being just too lurid for your liking your feelings are valid you may enjoy or dislike receiving the messages or you may be unsure about them do you not like receiving the messages at all tell the person to stop are the messages too vulgar and you would like something more discreet let the person know you prefer sweeter or more coded language how the messages make you feel will also determine how you handle the situation ask the text sender to stop sending you inappropriate messages or photos the first step to getting someone to stop sexting you is to simply request they stop contacting you this way it is quite possible that they really do not know that it is offending or upsetting you and most reasonable people will apologize and cease immediately obviously determining how to deliver the request could be a little tricky especially if you re trying to ask someone you like such as a friend or boyfriend girlfriend to stop the sexting talk to someone who you can trust to help you handle the situation this may be a friend family member teacher or school counselor you could also write down what you plan to say or stand in front of the mirror and practice decide how to talk to a romantic partner maybe your sweetheart thinks that sexting might heat things up at home but you re a little grossed out maybe your new date is using sexting as a means to seduce and perhaps even impress you they don t know you well enough yet to realize that it s actually upsetting you and perhaps you re too polite or confused to say otherwise tell the person hey i m not really into sexting or sexting makes me really uncomfortable i would rather you not send me messages like that for a love interest it can help to explain that you believe that intimacy should only be a face to face thing and that sexting feels sneaky unreal and smutty to you you could also add that texting is no replacement for talking and that you just don t appreciate sexting as a substitute for direct talk seek help if you are at work a co worker or supervisor may start sexting you perhaps a friendly gesture in the lunchroom or a comment you made during the last staff meeting gave one of your co workers or a casual acquaintance the wrong idea and now they ve taken the liberty of sexting you there are multiple ways to handle this you can tell the person to stop because maybe they just have the wrong idea you can also go the human resources department at your job and report this because this is considered sexual harassment handle a sext from a stranger have you received an inappropriate message or photo from an unknown number did a stranger send you something online in this case just block the unknown number or the sender it is best not to engage or respond to a stranger do not ask who it is or how the person got your contact information engaging with an unknown person on any level may encourage them to continue sometimes a person you dislike has your number just block them because they are probably sexting you to get on your nerves and bother you determine how to talk to a friend your friend might sext you as a joke or think it s not a big deal simply respond to your friend the next time it happens keep it light the first time you ask them to stop you could return the text or facebook message by saying something like gross no thank you or my mom spouse kids etc reads my messages so you probably shouldn t send me stuff like this if that doesn t work tell them in person or over the phone that sexting makes you uncomfortable and to stop doing it if all else fails you may have to block your friend until the message is clear do not encourage the other person s sexting have you done anything to encourage sexting perhaps you sent a photo of yourself in a scantily clad pose or perhaps you said something sexy that seemed to open the doors to more sexting if any of these things have occurred from your end you ll need to explain that you didn t mean for it to become a regular occurrence or to become more serious than you originally intended in the future always think twice before sending sexy photos of yourself or sending provocative words even if you have sexted with the person in the past you always have the right to change your mind and stop sexting do not feel guilty if you no longer want to participate don t play along if you don t want to communicate with the person in this manner being forthright about your preferences at the outset of the start of sexting is best talk to a parent or

day and time to talk don t make a lot of small talk on the phone and definitely do not say things like i love you or i miss you avoid confusing the situation even if the other person is the one who says it first stand strong but be gentle prepare for the meeting if you have to rehearse the delivery do it just don t have notecards out in front of you and refer to them while you re breaking up punctuate the other person s positive qualities first but make no qualms about why you re there to break up ask the other person if they were truly happy in the relationship you may be surprised to learn that he or she wasn t happy either be prepared for them to say they were though in which case asking them will backfire on you and you ll have to apologize and recognize that they were happy but explain that you re still not other points to consider 3 x research source avoid telling the other person that they drove you into the arms of another that will only escalate into an unproductive discussion and says more about your inability to be independent minded than it does about them it s not a tactic to escape unscathed it s a way of telling your soon to be ex that you re making excuses don t lead the other person on to think that you could possibly get back together make it clear that it s over don t point fingers it takes two to make a relationship work or not work acknowledge your own faults lack of participation and inability to contribute fully to the relationship don t drag out the past remain in the here and now instead of talking about the time he or she kissed someone else for example the idea is to not apportion blame or to try to make your soon to be ex look bad rather help them to see that this is ultimately a good decision for the two of you be on time for the meeting show the other person respect by being prompt and exactly in the place where you agreed to meet at the time you agreed if you know that they re never prompt take something along to do to pass the time so that you avoid getting frustrated waiting for them take a book your ereader or play phone games just resolve to stay calm until they arrive and after of course remain calm and in control throughout the discussion keeping in control of a conversation means being ready to open it and to lead with the news of the break up as quickly as possible also be prepare to ask questions as much as or more even than you re asked questions questions about how the other person is taking the news how they re feeling and what they ll do next by making them respond to your questions it shows that you care enough about their welfare to be interested but also deflects a focus off you all of the time as they re forced to think over how they re taking it and how they re going to move on 4 x research source all the same anticipate the possibility that your significant other could flip out so keep that in mind during your break up delivery if you remain calm perhaps you can tone down the situation

want them to collect their own things if they want to keep an eye on the time don t allow the break up to last more than an hour you owe the other person the time to discuss his or her feelings but you don t want to drag the break up out for hours doing so will just encourage unhealthy wallowing and your ex will be tempted to raise a whole raft of reasons why this shouldn t be happening and why you need to reconsider have a good excuse ready such as meeting someone else having to get work done or needing to get to bed early for an early meeting etc offer to drop them back home if it helps or to shout them a taxi ride try to end the meeting on a good note this may be impossible especially if the other person wasn t expecting it or didn t want to break up if the other person storms off

to identify any future plans or friendship dynamic 5 x research source after speaking with your now former significant other arrange to meet your new squeeze to reassure him or her that you went

how to handle valentine s day in a new relationship,valentine s day for new couples may feel as awkward as a 10 ton gorilla doing ballet given that your feelings for one another are very new and you re not sure where your relationship is headed whether you ve been on only one date or have been seeing each other for a few weeks the dreaded red hearted holiday can make even the most confident dater feel insecure about how to approach the holiday however having a simple conversation about the holiday or picking a low key gift or event can take the stress out of the day and turn it into something you enjoy,ignore it if it s too soon if you ve only been on a date or two it s probably best to ignore valentine s day altogether jumping on a romantic holiday may push your potential date away so it s probably a good idea to skip it for this year 1 x research source ask yourself what you really want think about how long you ve been in the relationship and how much you realistically expect the other person to contribute if you think dinner and a card is reasonable get the other person a card and ask him or her out to dinner on or near the day 2 x research source talk to your new crush one way to alleviate the stress is to simply talk to your crush about it you can suggest keeping it low key since you re new to the relationship as well as make a plan for a nice dinner or an outing if you d like 3 x research source for instance you could say our relationship is still pretty new why don t we keep valentine s day low key we could say no gifts though cards are fine do you want to have a nice dinner together ask the other person what they think of valentine s day some folks actually despise the holiday referring to it as a hallmark holiday it might be a good idea to even take the other person s temperature about how they even feel about it before pursuing a date on the day for example you could say i know our relationship is still in the early stages so i thought maybe we could talk about what we want to do for valentine s day are you a fan of the holiday or do you prefer to ignore it discuss the fact that you ve only been dating a short time and that you re both now confronted with a highly romantic holiday be honest about how bizarre it is to begin a new relationship as other couples are declaring their love from the rooftops let the other person know that you get the fact that both of you may not be ready just yet for poems and love songs as an example you could say so valentine s day is coming up i don t really know how to treat it since we haven t been dating very long what do you think we should do i know we re probably not ready for poems or love songs haha but i thought i would bring it up one option is agreeing to ignore valentine s day altogether if you re both happy with that option make a compromise if you both want different things try to make a compromise for instance if your new crush prefers something fancy but you d prefer to keep it low key maybe you could settle for a fancy home cooked dinner if you like to do it up big but your crush seems uncomfortable with that try to tone it down a bit if your new crush is a someone who gets you you should be able to find a reasonable compromise keep it simple at this point in the game you don t want to be too extravagant as you can scare the other person off a diamond necklace is over the top and too much if the relationship is still new however flowers or a nice box of candy may go over well 4 x research source definitely keep it under 50 if you ve only been dating a month or two 5 x research source also it s a good idea to skip any type of sexy or sexual gift such as lingerie this early in the relationship you don t want to scare the person off try a cute card you may not want to get too mushy at this point but a little mushiness mixed with some humor is fine for instance you may not want to pick a card that says i ll love you forever but a whimsical card that says i think you re cute or you make my heart go pitter patter would work better 6 x research source bake something another option is to bake your new crush a sweet treat a batch of brownies or cookies is thoughtful but you re not throwing a huge amount of money at the person gift your favorite book or movie this gift is personal as you re giving a bit of yourself to the other person however it s not so personal that you ll drive the other person away it s sweet and thoughtful but not over the top just be sure you know your crush s preferred method of reading books digital or book form or watching movies as an added bonus you could watch the movie together on valentine s day 7 x research source don t forget to add a note in the cover if you give a book including why you enjoy it it can act as card and gift go with a classic flowers candy and wine are always good gifts but try to do it with a bit of a twist for instance if you get flowers consider getting a pretty potted plant that will continue to bloom or a small pot of succulents if you know his or her favorite candy or wine wrap it up in a pretty package 8 x research source consider just getting drinks a nice no pressure event for valentine s day could be going to have drinks if alcohol isn t your thing you could get coffee instead that way you don t have the pressure of creating a monumentally romantic evening 9 x research source try cooking a nice meal if you re far enough along in your relationship that you want more than just drinks try cooking a meal for your lover it s not as big an expenditure as a fancy restaurant but it still shows you re thinking about the person enjoy a nice lunch or daytime event you don t have to go out at night a lunch or daytime event is less romantic than dinner doing a fun daytime event could take the pressure off the holiday while still letting you have fun keep your day date casual and low key go out around the holiday if the relationship is still new maybe you want to acknowledge the holiday somehow however with restaurants so busy on the day and lots of pressure about being in love maybe it s best not to go out on the actual day instead try going out the day before or after that way you still have a good time but there s not as much pressure take a stroll through a park or have a picnic another low key event is to go on a picnic in the park that way you don t have the pressure of going to a fancy restaurant and you can just enjoy each other s company plus you have the added bonus of swing sets if you are the playful type remember it s just one day valentine s day is only special because the culture acknowledges it to be but it s really just one day out of the year don t worry about it too much if your relationship is new if it s meant to last you ll have many valentine s days ahead to celebrate your love though you can also celebrate it every day you spend together 10 x research source,Relationships

overly aggressive maintain eye contact lean in and pause when your faces are close before you go any further to make sure your partner is also interested in a kiss from kissing slowly lead into something more physical take it slow when making a physical first move so you ve started kissing but you want to take it a bit further go slow to ensure the other person is on the same page as you light touches and closer body contact will not only make your intentions clear but can give you an idea of the other person s interest make sure to go slow enough to give the other person time to say no you want to have a fun consensual and safe time with each other this includes making the person feel comfortable if the person isn t ready to take it as far as you are then respect her wishes make sure you have protection this one seems like a no brainer but if you re preparing for a first move always have condoms on hand regardless of your gender women should bring their own too part of having

news to a parent who is easier to talk to can clear the way for talking to the other parent 3 x research source for instance if you grew up as a daddy s girl meaning you can now wrap him around your little finger you might start with your dad on the other hand if your dad tends to be overprotective you might start with your mother instead this approach can be an especially helpful idea if you are a teenager with your first boyfriend on the other hand if you think both of your parents will take it equally well or badly just rip off the bandaid and tell them both at the same time pick a good time you don t want to tell your parents when they are busy with something else or when they aren t in a good mood if you want you can ask them when a good time to talk would be try to choose a time when the house is calm and your parents are not stressed or distracted by something else 4 x research source however don t use picking a good time as a way to continually put off telling them you will need to tell them eventually so you might as well get it over with identify what you re feeling you are hesitating about telling your parents for a reason do you think that your parents will be mad because you re dating maybe you think they won t approve of the person you re dating on the other hand maybe you just prefer to keep your personal life private knowing what you re feeling is important because you can use that in the discussion 5 x research source for instance if you think that your parents think that you aren t ready to date you could say mom and dad i need to talk to you about something i ve been a little hesitant to tell you that i have a boyfriend because i think you think that i m not old enough get it over with once you sit down you just need to get the conversation over with don t beat around the bush however you can soften the blow with qualifiers for instance you could say i really love you two and i don t want to make you mad also i really want to be honest with you about my life i want to tell you about the boy that i ve started dating talk about why you feel you are ready to date if you are trying to make a case for dating lay out the reasons why you think you should be able to for instance maybe you think that you should be able to date because you are in high school and most people your age are allowed to date be reasonable and don t get angry if your parents don t agree your parents probably won t respond well to but everyone else is doing it however you can pull statistics off the internet about the average age that people start dating and you can bring up points about how you ve shown your maturity in the last year be willing to negotiate if you re parents don t want you to date and you re asking them to let you you need to be willing to compromise maybe you can suggest that you only see your boyfriend at school or that you only go on group dates with other people your parents just want to protect you so you have to be willing to give up some of your freedom 6 x research source listen to what your parents have to say and consider if their concerns are legitimate although they may be frustrating sometimes remember that your parents are older and have more experience than you do they may spot red flags or issues of concern that you haven t experienced yet if they express concerns watch out for signs that they could be true discuss the person tell your parents about your boyfriend talk to them about his family and what you like about him highlight his good qualities so they get a sense of who he is it s also helpful to have a photo for them to see 7 x research source your parents will probably have many many questions it is advisable to answer every question as honestly and fully as possible to reassure them about your new relationship if you try to hide or lie about something your parents may become suspicious and anxious if your boyfriend has a good relationship with his family make sure your parents know this trait is a major plus for many parents because it lets them know that this new guy in your life knows how to value others and can appreciate the tight ties of family don t try to hide it one of the most important things to do if you want your parents to accept your boyfriend is to be the one to tell them about your relationship if they find out about your relationship from someone else they may assume that you were trying to hide it because you felt you were doing something wrong 8 x research source you should tell your parents about your boyfriend even if you do not plan to make any formal introductions any time soon as a general rule the sooner you own up to the relationship the better avoiding the conversation will only make it harder to have eventually and will increase the odds that your parents may find out from another source once you get older and have already moved out of the house you do not necessarily need to bring up every date or every boyfriend you have wait until a guy comes along that you can exclusively and seriously commit to before getting everyone worked up wait on the negatives if you know something about your boyfriend is going to bother your parents don t start out the conversation with that instead wait until the middle or end of the conversation to talk about it for instance if your boyfriend is older than you you might want to hold off on that bit of news until near the end of the conversation 9 x research source understand your parents may be upset if you re going against your parents expectations of you they are probably going to be upset you re just going to have to deal with their anger and even tears until you can get them to see reason 10 x research source give it time it may take a little while for your parents to get used to the idea if they get upset while you are talking to them and tell you no they might change their minds later when they ve cooled down a bit either way you need to respect the fact that you still need to have a relationship with them meaning you can t just write them off as evil because they told you no 11 x research source wait until the time is right this kind of discussion is a difficult one especially if you aren t sure how your parents will react wait until you feel comfortable having the discussion it can be hard if you re questioning your sexuality as your parents may try to convince you re actually not gay 12 x research source if you show any hesitation about your sexuality your parents are likely to ask questions such as are you sure it s okay to discuss your feelings and reservations with them just realize that they may want to ask if you re positive about your feelings if you re not 100 sure it s okay you can have feelings for another guy now yet decide later that you prefer women sexuality can change over time but even if that happens later on it does not invalidate your current feelings or your current relationship do a practice run while coming out to anybody is difficult try coming out to someone who you know is sympathetic first for instance if you have a gay friend or know someone who is a gay ally talk to him or her about your sexuality before addressing it with your parents it s very hard to say the first time so trying it out on someone else first can make it slightly easier on you when you do go to your parents plus the person may be able to give you some tips if he or she is gay just be sure you completely trust the person first 13 x research source present them with the facts if you need to convince your parents try presenting them with facts about homosexuality you can find many good resources out there about homosexuality such as planned parenthood s website on the lgbtq community 14 x research source it s also good to have materials to give them or websites they can visit to read more about it 15 x research source give them time many parents need time to adjust to this announcement because most parents expect their kids to be straight they have to change their own thinking about who you are let them know it s okay to take time to adjust 16 x research source for instance you could say i know this announcement is a big one and i understand if you need some time to adjust to the idea i know i did understand when it s not a good idea if you know your parents will react very badly because of their beliefs you may want to rethink coming out to your parents that is if you think your parents may kick you out or even be physically violent with you it s best to wait until you are able to support yourself 17 x research source you may also not want to tell them if you are emotionally insecure and you know they would come down very harshly on you 18 x research source prepare ahead of time for how to deal with a bad reaction from your parents plan where you will go if things get heated and know who you can turn to for emotional support you can get help with coming out from a nonprofit center dedicated to lgbtq issues such as the trevor project https www thetrevorproject org trvr_support_center coming out sm 00019zneyztt2eehw0y1c8qhs18yj listen to their concerns love can blind us your parents might be overreacting to the fact that you have a boyfriend on the other hand they probably have some legitimate concerns that you should take into consideration 19 x research source calmly and politely ask your parents why they do not approve of your boyfriend maybe a trait of his makes them feel anxious and that anxiety could very well have validity and be something you should think more deeply about even if the reasons they give do not seem significant listening to their doubts and fears will give you an idea of what you need to do to convince them that the relationship is okay after all understand their role good parents take the job of protecting their children very seriously so it is only natural that they may have to struggle to accept the fact that you are growing up try having a little compassion for them 20 x research source along with being compassionate you should also be respectful no matter how the conversation goes you should treat your parents with respect if you can disagree with them about something in a respectful way your parents are likely to feel less upset and may eventually be persuaded to change their minds determine whether or not to keep the relationship going figure out how much the relationship with your boyfriend means to you and how drastically your relationship with your parents might be strained if you continue dating weigh the pros and cons of all sides to reach a conclusion about what to do yes of course you love your boyfriend but your parents will be your parents for life 21 x research source keep talking if you are unwilling to stop seeing your boyfriend keep bringing the topic up to your parents the more you talk things through the better both sides will be able to understand each other you may even get your parents to relent 22 x research source you should also provide more opportunities for your parents to get to know your boyfriend the more time they spend with him the more accurate their perception of him will be if he really is a good guy they might eventually drop their guard long enough to see that it s a good idea to arrange a casual meeting before you tell your parents about your relationship for example your boyfriend could attend a group hangout in your home with other friends this allows your parents to become familiar with him discuss the matter with your boyfriend a good guy will understand that winning the approval of your parents is an important step in your relationship together the two of you might be able to figure out some way of convincing your parents to confer their blessing upon you 23 x research source if your parents have never met the guy he might offer to introduce himself to them as a way of easing their minds if your parents offered specific reasons for why they do not approve of your boyfriend letting him know about these reasons may prompt him to try to fix whatever behavior or condition has them feeling anxious ask his parents for help discuss your relationship with your boyfriend s parents and seek their approval if they approve they might be willing to talk to your parents and try to persuade them too 24 x research source this step can be especially beneficial if you are a teen and he is your first boyfriend adults tend to relate to each other better than they relate to teenagers so if two respectable adults approach your parents and defend your relationship offering their assurances about their son in the process your parents might be willing to take this new evidence into careful consideration,Relationships

pick up every time or to pick up on the first ring if the girl feels like she can reach you whenever she wants then she ll be less likely to miss you if it seems a little bit hard to get a bit of your time then she ll value it more of course if she seems upset and really wants to talk as soon as possible then you should be there for her instead of acting aloof but if she s calling or texting just to check in then you shouldn t feel compelled to get back to her immediately continue pursuing your own interests don t give up all of the things you love just to be with the girl if you want her to miss you when you re not around then you should spend time continuing to do all of the things you love keep going to your soccer practice working on your novel or learning japanese let her know what

finger 4 x research source if she knows that you have plenty of friendships you care about then she ll see that you re an interesting person who lots of people want to spend time with if she feels like you re just sitting around waiting for her to call because you have no one else to hang out with then she ll be much less likely to miss you find a healthy balance between seeing your girl and seeing your friends you don t want to see them so much that you never have time for your girl and make her lose interest but you also don t want to see them so rarely that she feels like she s the only thing you care about keep her guessing if you want the girl you like to miss you then you can t let her know exactly what s on your mind and exactly what you re doing all the time though she should know you re interested you can t tell her that you think she s the greatest girl in the world and that you d do anything to have her though you can let her know your true feelings once she opens up to you more and spends more time with you you should leave her wondering about where she stands just a little bit 5 x research source you can compliment her and tell her things you like about her but you shouldn t tell her everything you think about her or you ll be putting yourself in a vulnerable position you should keep her guessing about your plans too if you have to leave early to catch your brother s basketball game you don t always have to tell her where you re going check in with her a bit when you re apart if you want the girl to miss you when you re not together then you have to remind her of your presence from time to time send her a text to say hi or to see how her day is going or give her a quick call to tell her about what you ve been up to you can also send her an email from work or shoot her a quick text when you re away with your friend for the weekend make sure you talk to her just enough that she doesn t forget about you but that she also doesn t feel smothered by you either if you re apart make sure you re not always the one getting in touch first you can call or text her from time to time but you shouldn t make her take you for granted and feel like you ll always call even if she doesn t if you know she has something important coming up such as a job interview or a volleyball game then check in with her to wish her luck if it just happened check in to see how it went this will show her that you care and that you are paying attention even if you re not always around be the last thing she thinks about at night one trick to getting the girl to miss you is to make sure you re on her mind as she s getting ready for bed you can send her a sweet text or plan your phone calls so you talk to her later in the evening so she thinks of you as she goes to bed and maybe even dreams about you she also may wake up thinking about the great conversation you had and will miss you even more as a result talking to her before she gets ready for bed will give you a better chance of really capturing her attention she ll be winding down and will be able to focus on you more easily instead of talking to you while having a million other things going on at the same time of course make sure it s okay for her to talk on the phone late at night you don t want her to get in trouble with her parents give her something that reminds her of you another way to make sure that the girl misses you is to give her something that makes it so you re never far from her mind it can be a necklace you gave her for her birthday a letter you wrote to her a sweatshirt that smells like you that you let her borrow or a book or cd that you thought she would really like these physical objects will make it so you have a bigger presence in her life and she ll be more likely to miss you while you re away you can get her a memento on one of your dates winning her a stuffed animal at a carnival or getting her a small souvenir from a trip you go on together will give her something that reminds her of you you don t need to splurge on this item what s most important is that it makes her think of you not the heft of the price tag write her a sweet note another way to make a girl miss you is to write her a sweet and sincere note about how much you like her it doesn t have to be long or too detailed but it should make her see that you really do care for her you can hand it to her on one of your dates or even mail it to her if you re apart she will keep the note and may even read it over again to be reminded of you giving her some physical proof of how much you care for her can make her miss you even more you shouldn t write the note just to get her to miss you make sure that everything you write is sincere and from the heart if you re too calculating she ll be able to tell ask her questions to show an interest in her life if you want the girl to miss you and to care for you more then you should ask her questions about herself whether you do so in person over the phone or in a letter you don t need to pry or ask her too many things to show her that you care if you re with her in person you can ask her about her family her pets her weekend plans her friends or her hobbies if you re texting her you can follow up about an important event in her life or just ask how her day is going the truth is that if you really want to get a girl to like you you have to show that you re interested in her this is much more important than being the coolest or most fascinating guy around at the end of the day girls just want guys who actually care about them if the girl really feels like you care about her then she ll miss you even more when you re gone make sure you actually remember the answers to your questions if the girl feels like she has to keep repeating herself around you then she ll get the sense that you don t really care treat her well when you re together you don t need to be mr too cool when you re with the girl you like if you want her to miss you when you re gone then you should do your best to make an impression on her when you re together make sure to charm her make her laugh make her feel special and generally let her see that you do care about her without coming on too strong you want her to remember you for the caring smart interesting person that you are so you have to make the most of your time together especially if you don t have a lot of it be attentive pay close attention to her to make sure she s having a good time and that she doesn t need anything like a glass of water or a change of scenery 6 x research source make her laugh don t worry about being romantic all the time relax and be a goofball around her and she ll like you all the more for it let her talk make sure you don t do more than roughly half of the talking you don t want her to feel like you re lecturing her or showing off by talking too much leave your conversations on a good note when you do spend time with the girl you like you should make sure that you don t overstay your welcome instead wait until you re having a great time talking and then tell her that you have to get going as long as you weren t supposed to hang out with her for longer this won t hurt her feelings when the conversation is at its peak she ll be thinking highly of you so you want to leave her with a positive impression of you when you re gone if you hang around too long until you both are struggling to come up with something to talk about then the girl won t remember you as being a fun person to talk to instead leave while you still have plenty of things to say to each other so she feels excited to pick up your conversation the next time don t try too hard to make her jealous though there are some tricks you can pull to make the girl you like be more inclined to miss you you shouldn t try to make her so jealous that she feels like she shouldn t bother with you because you re a player or because she doesn t want to fight for your affection while you don t have to tell her where you ve been all the time don t talk about other girls too much or openly flirt with every girl who comes your way unless you want the girl to get annoyed with you though some light flirting with other girls can make the girl you like see that you re a catch you don t want to push it so far that she feels like you don t care about her if she thinks that you re likely to mess around with other girls when you re away then she won t miss you very much if you see her out you should gather your confidence and give it a minute or two before you go up to her if you act like you don t see her or she s not cool enough for you then she won t be jealous of the people you re talking to she ll just think you re a jerk don t try to be someone else just to win her over as corny as it sounds at the end of the day it s important that you be yourself if you really want to win the girl over you shouldn t try to put on an act or be a guy who you think she d prefer to you instead you should work on letting her see your best attributes and take some time to open up about your more quirky interests though you don t need to act the exact same way around her as you would around your buddies you shouldn t put on an act either or she ll be able to see through it eventually if you really like the girl and want her to miss you then you should make sure the person she s missing is really you not some polished version of who you are though it can take a while for you to open up and show her who you really are you should try to be as genuine as possible when you re getting to know each other don t play too many games sure limiting your phone time or the time you spend together and playing a little hard to get can make the girl more interested in you and can make her more likely to miss you but if you take it too far then you ll just be confusing the girl and may even be confusing yourself in the process if she feels like your entire relationship is based around mind games and she doesn t really know who you are then her patience will wear thin pretty fast if you re kind and affectionate one minute and then cold and distant the next then she ll quickly get frustrated though you don t have to give it all away if she feels like she has no idea what s going on in your head she ll start to give up on you don t be afraid to tell her how you feel about her while it s important to leave her wanting more and missing you you don t want to take playing hard to get so far that she has no idea that you actually do care for her even if you re a bit shy you should tell her that you do like her and that you do want to spend more time with her don t let her do all the work or she may get tired of you because she ll think that you don t really like her you have to be willing to meet her at least halfway if you force her to chase you too much she may go for a guy who is more open with his feelings instead,Relationships
how to know if a woman is a cougar,cougars are popularly defined as women in their 40s or older who date significantly younger men generally at a 10 year age gap or more pop culture paints the cougar as predatory and pathetically desperate but women have recently begun fighting the stereotype real cougars they argue are confident successful single women over the age of 40 who tired of unromantic and narrow minded men their own age date younger more active and more adventurous men 1 x research source 2 x research source this article offers tips on identifying and attracting a cougar also and preferably known as an older woman,forget everything you think you know about cougars in fact forget the term all together if you are interested in dating and or having a romantic encounter with an older woman you ll need to treat her like a human being not some sexist stereotype of how a sexually active older woman looks and behaves determine the woman s age the generally accepted age group for cougars is 40 plus however some people go as low as 35 in their definition with new creams and procedures available many men and women are able to look much younger than they are some things you can look for which apply to both sexes 3 x research source dry dull and or thinning hair both men and women experience a decrease in the quality of their hair as they get older you might notice that an older woman has brittle looking hair that lacks the shine and fullness of younger people her hair might also be dyed to cover grey hairs 4 x research source sparse eyebrows and eyelashes as we age our hormones drop and hair growth slows which can make our eyebrows and eyelashes less lush some women might opt for pencilled or tattooed eyebrows and eyelash extensions so it still might be difficult to judge their age based on these factors alone thinner lips and eroded tooth enamel our lips wrinkle and thin with age and our teeth wear down and erode you might notice thin lines around an older woman s mouth thinner lips maybe partly hidden with lipliner and duller or translucent teeth thin skin as men and women get older the smooth skin on their necks gain ridges and wrinkles unless they use botox or have a face lifts that is thin skin will also be apparent on the hands making veins knuckles and tendons more visible dry and saggy knees and elbows with age the skin around our knees and elbows begins to dry and sag around the joints the skin around the elbows in particular can become darker and much drier than the surrounding skin evaluate her makeup evolutionary psychology has shown that when evaluating women s desirability physical attractiveness is a more important factor than it is in evaluating men s desirability 5 x research source this means that while less attractive men might still be desirable based on their intelligence humor income etc women are still largely judged on how they look for this reason it makes sense that with age a woman might amp up her makeup routine to try to hide the signs of aging that will make her less desirable you might notice an older woman wearing more foundation and structuring creams and shades to help give her face a smooth contoured look she might also be more likely to wear lipliner to make her lips look fuller a brow pencil to fill in her eyebrows and blush to make her cheeks look more youthful and rosy contouring is a popular makeup technique right now used by women in all age groups from their teens upward don t think you can judge her by her fashion sense the comical cougar stereotype is of a woman wearing clothes that are much too young and often too tight for her usually in tacky fabrics such as animal print the reality is that women of any age can dress in a tasteless and unflattering manner how a woman dresses regardless of her age depends largely upon her own personal sense of style while women of all ages wear push up bras older women may find them even more useful as their breasts will sag with age pay attention to her self confidence in general the older a woman gets the better she knows herself and what she likes and the more confident she becomes some signs that she is confident 6 x research source good posture whether sitting or standing a person with good self confidence will likely have a straight back and a head that is well balanced on the neck with the chin pointed neither too high nor too low relaxed a person with good self confidence will likely seem relaxed in most situations perhaps looking around the room with an easy smile or just seeming generally calm and at peace with herself she won t be very fidgety eye contact confident people make eye contact and maintain it in social interactions that said there s a difference between maintaining eye contact and staring intimidatingly at someone looking someone in the eye roughly 60 of the time you are talking to them is a good rule of thumb know what you want and be honest about it whether it s just sex or a long term relationship knowing what you want will help you figure out your best course of action to get it it s also important to be honest with the woman about what you want don t act like you want a relationship if all you want is sex women enjoy sex too she might be fine with some no strings attached fun some questions to consider is it sexual a checkmark on your bucket list or are you interested in something long term with someone who is more mature than your previous partners perhaps you have someone specific in mind already and are wondering how you can get her to notice you if you just want sex with an older woman for example your best bet might be dating sites geared specifically toward older women seeking younger men and vice versa there are even cruises devoted to connecting older women with younger men 7 x research source dating sites are also a good option if you are seeking a longer term relationship with an older woman again just be clear about your intentions from the beginning women in and over the age of 40 have lives too this means that you can meet them literally anywhere from the gym to a boating club to an acting class or even in your local grocery store spaces are shared interest are great for meeting people in general no matter your age forget the stereotype sure some older women might fit the traditional cougar stereotype but just as many if not more will not as with all people desires and behaviour differ depending on the individual when approaching an older woman for romantic purposes you ll do well to forget the cougar stereotype and simply treat her with the same respect and consideration that you would treat anyone else some websites would have you believe that there are specific types of cougar the moneyed cougar or sugar mama the angry cougar the sweet cougar alpha versus beta cougars 8 x research source 9 x research source while there is often some truth in stereotypes you re better off getting to know the individual woman rather than trying to lock her into some predefined narrow minded and generally unflattering idea of how a mature woman behaves show her you re interested if you re interested in a mature woman let her know how you show you re interested will vary depending on your own situation including where you meet the woman and how well you already know her if you meet a woman at the bar you might show your interest by smiling at her and seeing if she smiles back wait to see if she keeps looking back at you if she does this might be a sign that she s interested you could then approach her and ask to buy her a drink if you are interested in a woman who is in the same running club as you your tactic would be different you might gauge her interest by starting a conversation with her after the run it doesn t have to be anything too serious small talk about the weather and the run will do to begin with be prepared for rejection and take it gracefully if you approach a mature woman and she rejects you don t be a jerk about it it s okay to be disappointed and to even express your disappointment in a polite or witty manner it s not okay to call her names or threaten her do i m devastated but if you change your mind i ll be over there don t are you kidding me you re lucky to have a young guy like me show interest in you be young if you are trying to attract an older woman don t get stuck on the idea that you need to act like a man their age might act many women in their 40s admit to seeking younger men because they are more open minded adventurous and romantic when going out on dates be adventurous and willing to try new things share your interests with her and learn about her interests too as with any relationship take pleasure in learning and growing together you ll also benefit from being adventurous and open minded in the bedroom chances are she ll be clear about what she likes so it s important that you re willing to listen and possibly follow instructions be honest about who you are if a mature woman says that her last relationship ended because her partner was an unromantic stubborn workaholic and you know that you re approaching a critical time in your career where you will need to prioritize work over everything else it might not be the best time to get into a relationship with this woman be reliable and uncomplicated most older women and men have had enough relationships to know what works and what doesn t they re not interested in playing games cancelling plans at the last minute and forgetting to call for days to weeks might have been tolerated by younger women but more mature women will likely not put up with this behaviour 10 x research source,Relationships

to make your boyfriend jealous is because he s making you jealous by talking or texting with other girls then the first thing you need to do is stay calm if he s trying to get a rise out of you going on a rant and getting angry is exactly what he wants you to do instead be chill and act like you re above it 2 x research source it s possible that your boyfriend is flirting with other girls and doesn t even realize it so give him the benefit of the doubt and try talking to him about it if it s really bothering you make sure the conversation with him is very gentle and understanding not

boyfriend if your guy friends get along better with your boyfriend than with you this may not be very effective but if you are close to your guy friends then act playful around them in front of your boyfriend don t flirt excessively but give them a tender hug when they show up and compliment them on their style you can try telling your boyfriend something like you should get your hair cut like so and so or i really liked so and so s outfit you should dress like that more often do his favorite things with someone else maybe your boyfriend loves the chocolate chip cookies you make or he s really into baseball instead of making him his favorite recipe or buying him tickets to his favorite sporting event bake for someone else and do activities with someone else this doesn t have to be another guy but it does help if you bake cookies for someone else send him a text saying freshly baked cookies with a picture of the cookies and then if he asks tell him you made them for so and so then even if you have any extras tell him that you don t if he s really into sports purchase tickets and go to a game with someone else and then send him a picture or snapchat of you at the game try doing this with someone who would actually enjoy the event you re going to so it s not obvious that you purposely left your boyfriend out of it make a big change in your appearance one effective way to grab your

heavier during the day try going for a more natural glow that accentuates your best features remember communication is key if your boyfriend is making you jealous and isn t paying attention to you

to bring up a difficult subject when he s already had a hard day 5 x research source relationships are partnerships and they involve compromise and sometimes sacrificing things for one another if you feel you give and give and your boyfriend doesn t treat you well it may be time to consider ending the relationship explain to your boyfriend that you feel neglected if you feel your guy is being a little hands off or distant then tell him that you don t feel cared for very well encourage him to be more affectionate and passionate when you re together instead of trying to bring it out of him

you re trying to date her stick to tasteful comments about her clothes hair or smile be a sincere conversationalist avoid pick up lines because they don t sound sincere when you re talking to a girl say something you actually mean when she responds don t just pretend to listen really listen and try to move the conversation to a place that feels real of course the conversation should be appropriate for the setting if you re in a noisy bar the girl you re chatting up might not be in the mood to talk about personal or philosophical subjects still it should be possible to say something meaningful about the music the crowd or the feel of the evening that shows her you re enjoying the moment with her let her get comfortable when you ve just met a girl and you want to ask her on a date it s very important that she feels comfortable being herself with you enjoy her quirks and unique qualities and try not to be judgmental if you say something critical even in jest it could come off the wrong way and make her close up ask a lot of questions and follow up with comments that let her know you re listening and care about what she s saying joke around to keep things fun but avoid making fun of the girl her friends her family or anything else that hurt her feelings this early in the game put effort into your first date take her somewhere special it doesn t have to be expensive but it should be clear you put some thought into it share your favorite restaurant with her or take her to a beautiful scenic spot for a picnic if you know she likes a particular sports team buy tickets to a game 5 x research source don t get too nervous don t focus too much on the structure of the date instead try to genuinely have a good time getting to know someone you ve recently met think about all you have to learn about her and all she has to learn about you if you enjoy her company now chances are she s enjoying yours too get physical whether you place your hand on her back while you re waiting in line for tickets hold hands during a movie or go back to your place after dinner some kind of physical touch will increase the intimacy you feel with the girl you re dating just make sure it s all consensual 6 x research source call her when you say you will if you ended your first date with a promise to call follow up within the next few days if you reflected on the date and realize you re no longer interested give her the courtesy of letting her know you don t think it s going to work out if you want to continue the relationship don t play hard to get be consistent in your communication introduce her to your friends once you ve gone on a few dates a great way to get to know each other better is to introduce the girl you re interested in to your friends if they hit it off you might be encouraged to take the relationship to a deeper level 7 x research source throw in some surprises consistency is important when you re dating but you should also throw in some romantic surprises the surprises will depend on the personality of the girl maybe she d love it if you cooked dinner for her sent her flowers at work or planned a fun weekend trip she ll be impressed by your thoughtfulness if you mix it up sometimes,Relationships
how to keep a phone conversation going with your girlfriend,keeping a phone conversation going with your girlfriend can be daunting especially if you re not used to talking on the phone for extended periods it can be hard to know how to respond without visual clues like facial expression and body language or to think of topics of conversation when you don t feel like you have much to say talking to your girlfriend doesn t have to be an anxiety inducing experience though in fact with a little information and a good attitude you may find yourself looking forward to it,ask lots of open ended questions this is the most important part of keeping a conversation going with anyone from your girlfriend to you grandfather to the kid next door people like to talk about themselves as a general rule and if you open that conversational door most will walk through it 1 x research source try to ask more open ended questions and avoid ones with yes or no answer the idea is to ask things that will lead naturally into conversation not to pepper her with interview questions ask about her day this is an obvious place to start when asked simply how was your day many of us automatically respond fine thanks without even thinking about it this probably won t lead anywhere instead try something a little more pointed like did you do anything interesting today or did you make it to work before that storm started this morning it may not lead to anything particularly fascinating but it will ease you both into the conversation ask about mutual interests and acquaintances more than likely you and your girlfriend share various interests this is a great way to introduce a subject you can both talk about while still framing it as a question try asking what she thought of latest episode of a tv show you both like or if she read a recent interview with a mutual favorite author or if she s seen so and so lately ask for support or advice it is important to offer your girlfriend a sympathetic ear and a shoulder to cry on when she needs it but if she feels like you never need support from her in return she may begin to feel like a burden no one wants to date an emotionless robot who never needs help don t invent problems if none exist but if you are struggling with something don t be afraid to get vulnerable and turn to her for advice or validation ask what she wanted to be when she grew up when she was 7 this is a bit of an unusual question it will show her that you are interested in learning more about her and give you some new perspective 2 x research source share an anecdote from your day if something particularly funny or interesting happened to you today tell her about it it can be easy to rely too heavily on gripes about frustrating situations when you do this so try to make sure you are not just rattling off complaints make or discuss plans brainstorm fun things the two of you could do together this week if you already have plans talk about how excited you are to go to that concert or mention a review you read of the play you are going to see this will help her get excited too and make her feel like a valued part of your life share your goals and aspirations you don t want to monopolize the conversation but no one likes to date a person with no ambitions tell her about some of your hopes and dreams gossip this should constitute a small portion of your conversation and you should avoid anything too brutal or personal but this can be an easy fallback if you are at a loss there aren t a lot of people who can resist indulging in gossip from time to time 3 x research source follow up inviting her to tell you more about something she just said will let her know you are interested it will also extend the mileage you get out of that particular subject saving you from immediately having to come up with a new topic try to understand her empathetic listening is also known as active listening or reflective listening it refers to a way of listening and responding that seeks above all to understand the person who is speaking to you this is perhaps the most important conversational skill you can cultivate not only will this make conversation with your girlfriend flow more easily and naturally it will make her feel truly seen and heard increase her trust in you and bring the two of you closer together 4 x research source focus on her in a healthy relationship there should be equal conversational space for both of you that said sometimes one of you will need more attention or support than the other an empathetic listener is willing to let the other person dominate the conversation when he or she needs to without inserting his or her own ego pay genuine attention you can t fake this so don t try it can be easy to get so lost in trying to think of things to say that you forget to really listen this spells the death of empathy let her say what she needs to and listen without interrupting make open ended non judgmental responses that demonstrate you were listening often this can be as simple as telling her that sounds really hard i know how important your dog was to you this lets her know that you are listening and that you feel for her while giving her plenty of space to continue sharing reflect her feelings back to her if she just told you a story about a fight she had with her friends avoid saying something like it sounds like your friends are real jerks they don t appreciate how great you are this may seem like a supportive way to respond but the truth is that she loves her friends and your harsh judgment of them will ultimately come back to haunt you try responding with something more like it sounds like you felt really disrespected by the way they spoke to you this validates the way she s feeling without pointing fingers of blame or offering advice she didn t ask for invite her to continue use phrases like tell me more about it i d like to hear more about that how did that feel or what did you do then to encourage her to keep sharing ask for updates about things she mentioned before this will show her that you really pay attention to the things she shares with you and that you care about the things that are important to her try asking things like so was your boss less of a jerk today or is your mom feeling better or did you finish that book you ve been so into 5 x research source avoid offering solutions unless she asks for them many men see telling people about their problems as a practical route toward solving those problems many women on the other hand want commiseration more than practical suggestions when your girlfriend tells you about something she is struggling with your first instinct may be to offer solutions avoid this there is a good chance that what she wants is simply to get something off her chest if she wants advice she will probably ask for it until then a good working assumption is that what she really wants is just to feel understood 6 x research source 7 x research source demonstrate that you relate to what she feels this will definitely not be appropriate in all situations but sometimes sharing a story about a time when you experienced something similar can help validate her experiences and make her feel less alone don t go on too long though you don t want to overshadow her or make the conversation all about you avoid invalidating her feelings never say things like you re overreacting don t worry so much you ll feel better tomorrow it s not that bad or there s no reason to get so upset whether or not you feel like her emotional response is appropriate it doesn t change what she is feeling don t discount or minimize her emotions don t always expect rationality either emotions are not rational things and people who are upset are not always reasonable you should expect to be treated with respect but don t tell her she s being unreasonable or suggest taking a more rational approach there will be time for this later right now your job is to listen 8 x research source,Relationships

consequence to live with try to live up to your communities expectations of you if you are truly unhappy in a relationship you should have an honest conversation where you either make a plan with your partner to work together to improve it or decide to end the relationship so you can move on with someone else however if you decide to move ahead with your plans you should take the following into consideration set up a separate email address one of the easiest and sloppiest ways to get caught having an affair is to leave evidence of it around in easily accessible places create a new email address used only to communicate with the person or people you are cheating with don t tell anyone else about it or use it for anything other than your affair if you also use this account as a burner account for online updates or to catch spam it will feel normalized you want there to be a certain level of anxiety attached to this account this way you will remember to log out every single time you access it only write to your affair through this account never through your regular account keep your regular account logged in on your computer as you normally would so your partner has access to it if they grow suspicious and start snooping they won t find anything there clear browser history but only partially each time you do anything online related to your affair take a moment to clear your web browser s history of the sites related to your affair note that this applies to more than just your fake email address do this for every site related to your affair such as yelp reviews for a restaurant where you want to meet them directions to a park where you re going to meet them reservation sites for hotels etc don t clear your entire browser history as this will look suspicious nobody keeps their entire history clean instead go through your history and manually delete suspicious websites as soon as you re finished using them use the private browsing mode on your web browser the best way to ensure that you don t accidentally leave any evidence of your activities behind in your browser history is to always use the private browsing setting when doing something you don t want to get caught doing if you are using a major browser to surf the internet you likely have a private browsing option available to you safari 4 x research source chrome 5 x research source firefox 6 x research source opera 7 x research source and explorer 8 x research source all allow you to use the internet without recording evidence of it on your computer note that this does not mean you are completely anonymous while browsing websites still know your i p address visited their sites as a result you can see targeted ads generated from your private browsing session 9 x research source to avoid getting caught through your targeted ads make sure you close out all private windows every time you re finished using them this will delete the cookies that lead to suspicious targeted ads lock your cell phone if your phone is already locked and your partner doesn t know the code you re in the clear however if your phone isn t locked or if your partner knows the code you need to re secure your phone create a believable explanation for why you need to suddenly secure your phone you might say that some people at work got into it and found private pictures of you and your partner or that they sent a string of text messages to people in your contact list if your partner is accustomed to knowing the code to your phone it would be highly suspicious of you to suddenly insist on privacy don t try to change the password but don t use your phone for any suspicious activity if you need to communicate with your affair through your phone use the private browsing option on its browser to log into your cheating email account remember to log out and close the private window to delete cookies when you re done use your phone minimally if your partner sees a sudden spike in calls or texts to your affair s phone number this could raise suspicions keep phone calls brief and text only when necessary the majority of your communication should be conducted through your designated email account buy a prepaid cell phone a prepaid cell phone would allow you to communicate with your affair freely without worrying about the charges showing up on a monthly phone bill however it s highly risky because being caught with a strange secret phone would make even the most trusting partner wonder if you do use a prepaid cell phone be incredibly careful about not getting caught with it have an excuse prepared just in case your partner does end up finding it you might say that a colleague left it behind in the office and you forgot to drop it off to them on your way home for example don t use credit cards on suspicious purchases any questionable charges hotel rooms out of town businesses will show up on your monthly statement suspiciously large charges such as dinners for two at a nice restaurant might also attract attention whenever making purchases you don t want to get caught making use cash rather than card to avoid leaving a paper trail behind buy separate birth control there is absolutely no reason that the amount of condoms or other birth control should fluctuate unexpectedly within a committed monogamous relationship missing or extra condoms are a flaming red flag the birth control you use outside of your relationship should be kept completely separate from that you use with your partner buy separate condoms when sleeping with your affair purchase small packs or individual condoms rather than boxes so you won t get caught with extra condoms stashed in your car throw away unused condoms before returning home instead of keeping them around laugh at their suspicions instead of getting mad by getting mad you re signalling to your partner that you have a negative reaction to their accusation rather than a bewildered one anger also transitions quickly into an argument and arguments get drawn out and linger in the back of the mind you want to avoid attaching lasting negative memories to this conversation and the best way to do that is to keep it from getting heated don t laugh in a mean spirited way and don t make fun of your partner for having their suspicions simply act surprised or bewildered by the suspicions as though it never would have occurred to you that you were acting in a questionable way talk to them about their suspicions after your initial lighthearted reaction you don t want to run away from the conversation as this might make them feel like you re not taking their feelings seriously that resentment can also linger and fester so you want to address this head on tell them that you re sorry they feel that way and that you didn t even know that you were causing them to feel insecure in the relationship allow them to voice their concerns and be a good listener don t interrupt them or get defensive make note of their specific suspicions as this will let you know what mistakes you re making promise to make an effort to work on those trust issues a good partner will feel bad about making them worry so assure them that even though they have nothing to worry about you will make an effort to be more attentive to them change some of your suspicious behaviour if you let your partner speak honestly they may have given you a list of specific concerns they have about your behaviour if you change that behaviour without warning it may only make them even more suspicious however if you have an open conversation with them about how you promise to change those behaviours they will interpret your changed behaviours as dedication to working on your relationship tripping all over yourself to completely change your behaviours might make you look like you re overreacting or have a guilty conscience don t make dramatic changes simply change your behaviour enough to demonstrate that you re making an effort to maintain trust in the relationship stop the affair or put it on hold if your partner is too on target with their suspicions it may be time to call off the affair or at least put it on hold until the danger passes even after the conversation about your partner s fears even after you promise to make them feel safer in the relationship your partner may still harbour suspicion don t take unnecessary risks,Relationships

questions that have more than one word answers such as what do you think of the movie you saw last weekend or what is the best part of that new game i heard you bought this is the time to use the list of topics you thought about before you called him find a way to bring up those topics and then ask him questions about them this gets him talking about his interests and lets him know you noticed him 4 x research source try to avoid questions like what s up they are very vague and don t give the conversation anywhere to go also avoid asking what his favorite food or color is these questions are really common and won t make you seem interested or interesting this is the time to show him how great you are 5 x research source listen you don t want to monopolize the conversation so make sure you listen to him as much as you talk no one likes it when they spend the entire time on the phone and can t get a word in also pay attention when he s answering the questions you ask him respond to things he says giving your input when needed or laughing when he makes a joke or says something funny even if you have something you really want to say make sure you don t interrupt him you don t want to seem rude and want to give him plenty of time to get his thoughts out he would probably love to hear what you have to say just wait until the right time to give your response 6 x research source 7

had a great time talking to you but i m meeting my friends for coffee in half an hour this let s him know that you like him but also lets him know you aren t going to be sitting at home waiting by the phone 10 x research source you don t want to keep him on the phone too long if either of you are pausing too long or are trying to fill the silence it means you ve probably gone on too long try to

when you were last together such as how did that paper turn out that you were working on a few days ago this way he knows you pay attention to him when you re together and knows you care this is especially helpful if you find that you ve run out of things to say the last few times you ve been together or talked on the phone this doesn t mean that the relationship isn t working but it could just mean that you re both shy or that you two don t know each other that well yet call him don t wait around for him to call you just because he s the guy that doesn t mean that he is the one initiating everything calling him lets him know you re thinking about him that you care and that you are still interested in him make sure you don t call him too much this seems clingy and you don t want to suffocate him keep it balanced 13 x research source ask about important things don t be afraid to ask personal or difficult questions ask him what his future goals are what his life s ambition is or what he is most scared of in the world try phrasing it in a way that makes it open ended for him to fill in as much detail as he wants such as i know you re majoring in civics what would be your dream job this lets him know you care about him on a personal level and that you want to know all the different parts of his personality 14 x research source don t ask him where he thinks the relationship is going or other questions dealing with your relationship this might scare him off or make him uncomfortable answer thoughtfully make sure you pay attention to the questions he asks you give adequate lengthy responses that fully answer his questions if you give clipped short answers he might think you re mad at him 15 x research source don t overshare even though you are trying to get to know each other better you want to keep some things to talk about at a later time so there is still mystery in your relationship 16 x research source try not to sound cocky you don t want him to think you re arrogant or showing off too much discuss common interests pick things that you know you both have in common this way you both will have something to contribute to the conversation and you can find some common ground by giving your perspective you let him know that you have your own mind while still having similar interests to him 17 x research source don t bring up topics that you know you disagree on if he does don t lie and tell him you agree with him but steer the conversation back to a safer topic with phrases like i don t necessarily agree with that policy but i do agree with your stance on that new health bill you don t want to start a fight or bring unnecessary strife to your phone conversation listen no matter if you are uninterested in what he s discussing or if he s told a particular story before listen to what he has to say when he answers your questions pick up things to bring up later or use them to get to know him better just don t monopolize the conversation you want him to know that you don t always have to be in control of the conversation don t be afraid of silences just because there is a pause in conversation this doesn t mean that the phone call is going badly silences can mean that you re becoming more comfortable with one another and that you just enjoy being in each other s presence 18 x research source,Relationships

sort through your feelings and verbalize them to them in a non accusing way 2 x research source and the most important thing here is that you will be open about your feelings as much as possible for example if they do or say something that bothers you be open about how it impacts you without being accusing or asking them to change if you establish solid lines of communication from the outset you ll know sooner rather than later whether this relationship will endure or fizzle out speak your mind don t be afraid to make your desires needs and opinions known even when they may conflict with your partners you don t and shouldn t exist solely to please them besides showing that you are your own person with your own needs desires and approach to life will keep them interested in getting to know and understand you as a person if you re comfortable with speaking your mind then they ll be comfortable with speaking their mind too 3 x research source just remember to express yourself in way that doesn t attack anyone else s opinion or lifestyle in any way you can be humble and outspoken at the same time by using assertiveness strategies and remaining considerate of their feelings too be yourself don t create a fake you just to impress them it might be tempting if you think they d prefer a different type of girl but usually this is just cobbling together snippets of things said or suggested and you re likely to be wrong after all they want to date you not some imagined form of perfection and if you really feel tempted to change things about yourself because they insist that you d be better thinner taller prettier quieter whatever then it s a good indication that you re not compatible if they actually say such things to you in a badgering persistent manner then it is not love but an attempt to control you don t pretend that you share their interests if you don t it might be amusing or safe to do so initially but it s extremely hurtful when they learn that you don t really love what they love they could be basing their thoughts about your role in their future on something that isn t real and it ll end up hurting both of you take an interest in their interests remember what they like to do and what they like to talk about you don t have to act like you love their hobbies but at least try to understand why they re such a fan if they love a band try to understand why if they just love to be playful and immature remember that it might just be their way of releasing stress in learning to accept their unique way of being you ll also be learning more about yourself and ultimately whether you could see yourself spending the rest of your life with this person 4 x research source you don t have to take an interest in all of their interests if they enjoy watching baseball but you just can t get into it that s fine too just asking about their interests and talking about the things that matter to them can be enough learn to work as a team as in any healthy relationship you ll experience your share of conflicts some tiny some big remember to be true to yourself and try to abandon any significant selfishness a relationship is a matter of teamwork and a symbiotic relationship not a parasitic one where a party gives and the other one just takes without giving enough back in a team you have each other s back you don t undermine one another and you openly cherish each other in front of others 5 x research source in times of hardship a team approach can help you to work through problems in a less emotionally attached way in that both of you assume responsibilities for fixing things rather than expecting one or the other to fix things avoid having a one track relationship in which the bond revolves around one thing keep your relationship strong by bringing variety and diversity into the relationship try different and new things together relationships are about having fun together learning together and growing together compliment them more than you criticize them if everything you say around them is a criticism or an attack they won t look forward to seeing you and they ll start reconsidering being with you all the same you don t always have to agree with them just because they are your partner tactfulness is a better strategy in mature relationships and establishing boundaries and making compromises are important relationship strategies to learn and adopt 6 x research source though you can bring up a valid criticism when it feels right you should say at least four positive things about them for every negative thing you say don t nag them just because you re in a bad mood or things aren t going perfectly learn to compromise if you want to be a good girlfriend then you have to learn to compromise instead of fighting or being angry the second you don t get your way to compromise well you both have to be able to calmly and rationally discuss a situation while understanding the other person s perspective try to understand where your significant other is coming from instead of blindly focusing on what you think you need 7 x research source you don t want to be that girl who always gets her way just because your partner would rather give in than stand their ground because you get so angry and upset whenever things don t go your way give each other space you should support your partner but you should also be able to be there for them in spirit when you re not actually around if you want to be a good girlfriend then you have to make time to do your own thing to hang out with your girlfriends and to see your partner 8 x research source they should know that you re thinking of them and rooting for them even if you re not around if you feel insecure and doubt the strength of your relationship the second you re apart then you have a problem you should support your partner if they just want to have a night out with their friends instead of trying to intrude it s important to allow your significant other to have time to spend with their friends and hang out without you if you feel entitled to all of their time and attention learn how to not be an obsessive girlfriend don t be an overly protective girlfriend let them go out without them feeling watched remember that they don t need you for everything and that you are separate people as well as a couple when they need some space don t take it personally recognize it for what it is their time to rejuvenate and to share different interests with others but do make sure they know that you re always there for them be affectionate there are various ways to show your affection some are more obvious than others and the way you approach this will depend on how openly affectionate you like to be personally affection is close to but not the same as intimacy affection is about openly displaying that you care about this person and can be shown any time of day or night publicly or privately 9 x research source think about how you like to show affection to people you care about such as holding hands touching an arm quick kisses on the cheek a hug stroking hair supportive words mentioning how great someone is in front of other people etc pet names like baby or sweetheart are a cute way to show your affection for your partner try not to overdo this however it can be a major turn off if you call them mr cuddle bear especially in public of all things good communication is the vital part of any relationship so make sure that they know how much you like them regular lovey dovey texts and emails can be a plus but too many will become overwhelming and you may seem clingy these types of things do show you re into them and you want it to last forever but don t come on so much that you scare them be seductive don t be afraid to be seductive most people find it irresistible when a girl is sexy classy and confident confidence means being happy within your own skin you will exude this without trying if you are accepting of yourself and feel secure about your own worth you don t have to force yourself to be the most popular bubbly personality if that isn t your style rather be the best you on show by taking good care of yourself and trusting that you re worth their attention 10 x research source give them gifts when you re in a relationship it s fun to give each other small gifts everyone loves to get presents and giving them one shows that they mean a lot to you don t overdo it just give them a gift when you re feeling loving and want to let them know how much they mean to you you don t want them to think you re trying to buy their affection 11 x research source make them something by hand a paper flower an artsy heart something creative that reflects your personality so that whenever they look at it they ll think of you and smile if you re the musical type or play an instrument feel free to play them a song or two bonus points if you play a song you wrote yourself add a private video of your song to youtube don t get jealous you should be loving but not to the point where you start seeing red the second your partner talks to or even just mentions another girl nothing will turn your significant other off faster than a girlfriend who is so insecure that she can t stand the thought of other women existing in the universe your partner will appreciate you even more if you re nice to their female friends instead of talking about how ugly or annoying any girl you see is 12 x research source if they re out with their friends don t text them every two seconds to make sure they re not talking to other girls this will only make your partner see how little you trust them,Relationships

their back or grabbing their arm or hand gently to escalate the tension 2 x research source if you re sure of their interest try lightly grazing the side of their face to make it more subtle say something like i ve got to get that hair out of your face hold on there you go look into their eyes like you re intrigued and excited by them sustaining eye contact is a simple way to ratchet up the tension between you don t simply look at them look right into their eyes and give a half smile like you re trying to figure them out glance away then look back again 3 x research source looking deeply into their eyes shows that you re invested and intrigued by them which will in turn make them feel mysterious attractive and confident enough to keep flirting remember not to stare at them stay natural glancing away from time to time but allow yourself to make eye contact for a little longer than you usually would before looking away start a low key conversation to break the ice whether you re just meeting this person for the first time or are looking to take an established friendship to the next level your interaction should start at a place that s comfortable for this point in the relationship bring up at topic you ll both have something to say about and encourage them to keep talking about it in a subtle flirtatious way for example you could try talking about something around you by saying something like you ve gotta tell me what s going on with this drink do you have a name for that you could also try teasing them or giving a playful challenge for instance you could say something like let s make a bet if i can push you in the pool tonight first you have to give me your hat if you get me first it s up to you tell a more personal or flirtatious story once you ve broken the ice start subtly introducing the idea of something more tell a story about a time someone was flirting with you and something funny happened or point out other people who are flirting or teasing each other don t be obvious about it keeping the sexual undertone in the subtext will make it all the more alluring 4 x research source say something like look at amanda and robbie right now they ve been flirting all night how much do you wanna bet that he s gonna ask her to dance later try telling a personal story by saying something like the last time i was at this bar the craziest thing happened i was talking to this girl and well i don t know if i should tell you pull them closer and push them away verbally and physically to add tension creating a push and pull dynamic is one of the best ways to create sexual tension you ll show them you re interested but not too interested then back off to keep them wanting more you can do this both verbally and physically to create an exciting flirty interaction 5 x research source try verbally pushing and pulling by saying something like i keep thinking how sweet you look but i m not sure i can trust you you could also play a bit of physical push and pull by doing something like leaning into them and talking righ in their ear then sliding away pique their curiosity by only sharing as much as you need to an air of mystery is key to building sexual tension playing with their curiosity will intrigue them and make them want to figure you out when they ask a question answer simply telling just enough to get their interest then turn the question back to them if you re telling a story don t ramble on instead give it in short pieces making sure to pique their interest before the next part 6 x research source for instance if they ask what you do for work you could say i work at a marketing research firm right now i m doing a lot of social media stuff it can pretty funny how about you you re setting them up to ask more about your job while showing that you re more interested in theirs if you re telling them a story you can leave them longing for more by saying something like that reminds me of this thing that happened the other day i saw this guy walking his dog down the street and you know i don t know if i should tell you this is my best story and we don t even know each that well don t be afraid to use silence as well when you re flirting falling quiet for a second can be a great tool giving you a chance to use your body language and ramp up the tension without even saying a word be confident and believe that they re interested in you even if you re not sure confidence is one of the most attractive traits you can have and exuding it can help ramp up sexual tension fast if you don t feel confident naturally though you can still fake it and reap the rewards 7 x research source try taking a relaxed stance lean on a table keep your shoulders open and cross your arms in a confident almost cocky way smile and make eye contact even if it feels too bold if you re struggling try pretending that you re someone else who s more confident choose a celebrity a friend or even a stranger whose confidence you can feel act how you think they would until it feels natural put the idea of confidence in your head by repeating to yourself they re attracted to me they want me even if you don t believe it it can give you a noticeable boost of confidence take things slow physically making sure they feel comfortable and secure rushing into physical aspects is always a bad idea if the other person isn t ready for it you ll put them in an uncomfortable or even scary position even if they are in the mood for something more going fast can make you look desperate and ruin the sexual tension instead make sure that you both want the same things and that you re both feeling safe and comfortable 8 x research source say something like are you ok with this or i want what you want what do you feel like moving slowly can also be sexy in its own right drawing out your experiences together will make you both crave more and the sexiest thing is knowing that someone wants you as much as you want them tease or challenge them to make them want to impress you showing that you re witty funny and interesting over text is a great way to create sexual tension send them teasing or even lightly challenging messages creates a push and pull dynamic you re showing them that you re not totally impressed with them yet which makes them want to get even closer to prove themselves send something like wow that profile picture just wow let s play a game you tell me 1 thing that s true about you and 1 that s false and i ll try and guess and let s have prizes too your taste is the worst you re not allowed to watch any movies that i haven t pre approved first use emojis to add sexual tension to a regular text you can keep the actual text of your messages on the safer side but imply a more playful or flirtatious vibe with your emojis make sure not to overdo it though using more than 2 emojis on a text or going overboard with exclamation marks or question marks can come off as desperate and make sexual tension disappear 9 x research source try pairing overtly flirtatious emojis with a more subtle text for instance you could add a smirking emoji to a message like you better be careful with me i play to win or try going in the opposite direction by paring an innocent emoji with innocent text like adding an angel emoji to a message like who me flirting only use 1 or 2 emojis per text so it doesn t get overwhelming break up playful texts with something more serious or complimentary sending light hearted flirtatious texts are a great way to build sexual tension slowly but once you ve established it mixing up the tone can really work in your favor when you re comfortable enough with each other send something more serious or focused like a compliment or a confession of some kind try something like in all seriousness tho i couldn t take my eyes off you last night i teased you about this but honestly when you opened the car door for me last night it was really hot i really can t stop thinking about you talk about things you ve done together in a new light if you ve been talking for a while or were friends in the past you can create sexual tension and a deeper connection by remembering things you ve done together while adding an element of flirtation remind them of something then admit something you felt at the time that you couldn t express hinting at deeper feelings without expressing them outright will deepen the sexual undertones of the conversation 10 x research source i m thinking about that first text you sent me that line you used like come on but i guess i shouldn t be laughing because look at us now remember how we met you just sat down next to me and then were like this seat isn t taken is it yeah that was a good entrance use subtle innuendos when you start to get more comfortable with each other sending witty innuendos or hints can be effective as long as you do it carefully you want to give off a vibe of playful sexuality and desire without seeming desperate or creepy which means relying on wit and teasing to make it work when used right you ll get the other person into the same flirtatious mindset as you try something like 11 x research source i just ate the most amazing burger it was almost sexual haha i had a dream about you last night but i m not telling what it was about,Relationships
how to make a girl want you back,making a girl want you back can be a challenge especially if your relationship ended on a bad note however if you know that you have an unbelievable connection then it ll be worth it to pick up those soggy embers and try to rekindle that old flame if you want to know how to make your girl like you again and want you back then you need to give her space while making her remember how amazing you are if you want to know how to do it just follow these steps,give the girl some space though you may think that the best way to get your girl back is to fight for her tooth and nail you re actually better off giving her some breathing room than fighting for her affection right away unless it s getting serious between her and another guy and you re determined to break them up you should play it cool until she has time to heal and to get a fresh perspective on the relationship 1 x research source this doesn t mean that you should cut off communication completely unless you think that s best but you shouldn t text her every five minutes or ask her to hang out with you all the time unless you want to scare her off if you give her space she ll also be more likely to think about you she ll think i haven t heard from insert your name here in a while that must mean that he s just fine without me this will intrigue her and make her wonder what you re up to if she initiates a hang out early on fine but don t come on too strong when you do get together giving her space is also a sign of maturity this will make her want you even more it goes without saying don t go too long before you swoop in enough again wait long enough so she has time to heal but not so long that she forgets all of the wonderful things about you each situation is different feel it out though as a general rule give it at least a few weeks but no longer than two months think about what went wrong while you re giving your girl some space don t just sit idly by and wait for the clock to run its course instead think about why things ended between the two of you if it was something obvious like you not giving her enough time great but if it was something more complicated a combination of her not feeling appreciated enough and you spending too much time partying for example than you need to pinpoint the problem or problems that caused your love to fizzle out 2 x research source if she was the one who ended things then you will have more of a challenge on your hands think about all of the reasons she ended it if she ended it abruptly look through old emails or texts to see if you can pinpoint the problem if you re the one that ended it then you may have a different challenge on your hands you have to convince her that you won t break her heart again make a game plan for addressing the problem once you ve located the problem it s up to you to find a solution if there are several problems well then you ll need to find several solutions or an overarching solution that tackles all of these problems if it ended because you spent way too much time with your friends find a way to make her a bigger priority by setting up weekly date nights and coming up with new things you want to do together if it ended because of your inability to communicate practice honesty and compassion in your everyday relationships 3 x research source part of fixing the problem will mean working on yourself there s no way that you were blameless in the relationship another part of the game plan will mean that you ll have to work on how you perceive her if her obsession with horses drove you nuts find a way for it to not annoy you before you move on if you have to work out some major issues then make a long term plan for how you ll do it whether it s going to therapy dropping an addiction or giving yourself a major personality overhaul in some regard work on yourself even if you think you ve found the exact problem and solution that would win your girl back instantly it s rarely ever that simple instead you need to work on making yourself a more desirable person overall when you come crawling back to your girl she will see the difference this means working on yourself inside and out though getting a new haircut won t impress her looking like you re more happy to be alive and that you re more conscious of the image you re projecting will catch her attention 4 x research source devote more time to your favorite hobbies whether it s biking or mechanics being more excited about your interests will make you a more fun person to talk to work on developing a more positive attitude toward life if she feels happier just from being around you then she ll be more likely to keep wanting to see you let her see that you re doing just fine without her if she hears that you ve been absolutely miserable crying in public and shouting her name out on street corners she ll be turned off quicker than you can say i miss you instead you want her to hear and see that you re having a great time going about your everyday life without her by your side she ll see you as a dynamic person who has a lot going for him and will begin to wonder why you re not openly showing signs of missing her more casually hang out at a place where you re both likely to be make sure you show up with friends and she sees you laughing and having a good time without overdoing it if you see her socially like at a party don t drop everything you re doing to run up and ask how she s doing come up to her eventually but let her see that you have a busy social life without her make her friends see that she needs you it s a fact you will never be able to make your girl want you back if her friends can t stand you if her friends don t like you because you were too controlling not caring enough towards them or just because you were a bad boyfriend then your job is to make them think that maybe you weren t so bad after all and to pass this information on to the girl you want 5 x research source if you run in to her friends make a conscious effort to make small talk without being too obvious about it if you talk to her friends don t bring her up immediately though you can casually ask how she s doing and really let them see that you re hurting if you re open to being so vulnerable slowly approach her when the time is right after enough time has passed and you ve made it back on her radar you should slowly start to make your way back into her life it can be as simple as stopping to have a five minute conversation if you run into her or casually sliding your tray next to hers at lunch or even texting her if you know that she ll love something that s about to start playing on tv keep it cool be sweet to her while making her wonder if you are just looking to be friends don t shower her with compliments the second she hangs out with you again once you ve started talking again up the ante invite her to do something simple like grab coffee or check out a lecture together don t ask her to do anything romantic quite yet show her you ve changed you can let her see that you re a changed man without shouting look how different i am just spend enough time with her to see that you really have changed your ways if changing your ways was necessary if she thought you were too messy put an effort into your appearance if she criticized you for always showing up late make a conscious effort to show up early to your next coffee date don t point out these changes let her see for herself and she will be truly impressed these changes should feel natural to you don t change something about yourself just to please her or you ll fall right back to your old ways the first chance you get if you feel like you really hurt her while you were dating it s never too late to apologize she will be touched that you ve put that much thought into the relationship after it ended play hard to get that s right just when you think you re about to get your girl back just when she s finally realizing what an amazing catch you were is not the time to declare your love instead throw her a curve ball by making her see that she still has to fight for your affection instead of just falling into your arms as you start to hang out more and more make sure to not always be available go mia for a few hours and make her wonder where you are her mind will be racing if you ve gone on dates mention them without being too descriptive so she really thinks that she can lose you make sure she wants you back once you feel like you ve grabbed her attention and have even made her a little jealous it s time to check in to make sure that she really wants you back before you tell her how you really feel though you don t have to know how she feels with 100 certainty the more sure you are that she wants you back the less likely you ll be to embarrass yourself here are some signs that she wants you back 6 x research source check out her body language when you talk to her does she lean closer to you and make eye contact looking at the floor every time she gets embarrassed see if she s jealous does she ask if you re seeing other women or look upset if she sees you talking to other girls if so then she may want you all to herself see if she s started treating you like a boyfriend again has she given you hugs compliments and asked you to go on date like adventures tell her how you feel once you re pretty sure that she shares your feelings there s no point in beating around the bush find a time when you can both be alone and pick a place that is just a little bit romantic and gives you the privacy that you need then look into her eyes and tell her how much you ve missed her and how much you d like to date her again you don t have to grovel but you should show her that you ve put a lot of thought into the failed relationship and that you re determined to make it work this time be specific show her how you ve made an effort to change instead of making empty promises give her time if she s reluctant at first don t get angry or disappointed remember that even if she does want you back she still wants to protect her heart give your new relationship a fresh start if you re lucky enough that your girl wants to give it another go then you should try to start fresh as much as you can though you can go back to enjoying some of the same restaurants tv shows and things that you loved together it s important to pick some new activities and relationship strategies so your relationship doesn t feel like another version of your former dating experience 7 x research source though you can bring up the happy memories try to avoid thinking or talking about any bad experiences you ve shared unless you can laugh about them don t take her for granted just because you re dating again doesn t mean that you shouldn t take the time to let her know how much you care about her take it slow treat it like you re starting a new relationship instead of jumping right back into an old one don t spend all of your time together right away even if that s what you were doing before you broke up don t make the same mistakes though you shouldn t constantly worry about the relationship ending you should be conscious of whatever it was that made your relationship fail the first time if it failed because you spent too much time with your friends and you find yourself hanging out with your friends all the time again cut back a bit and if it ended because of something that she did have an honest conversation about it if it comes up again remember how awful you felt when you made those mistakes the first time you don t want to go through that pain again don t overthink it though you should be conscious of the mistakes you made you cannot obsess over them or you will doom your relationship to failure before it has a chance to start off on the right foot if a bad situation arises you can remember what happened the last time and proceed with caution but don t constantly worry about messing things up or you won t be able to truly enjoy your time together if you re always worrying about messing things up your girl will be able to tell and that won t make the relationship very enjoyable for her remember to be yourself though if you needed to make a dramatic change for the better to be in the relationship then so be it but you shouldn t walk around like a dog with his tail between his legs because you re so set on making up on whatever hurt you caused that you can t relax in the end your girl started dating you the first time because of who you are so don t forget to let her see the parts of your personality that she loved the most 8 x research source if you feel like you can t be yourself without causing a major problem to the relationship then you have to rethink your priorities have confidence remember that she loves you not just a more meek version of yourself who is desperate for her affection,Relationships

ex boyfriend but there are some basics to consider for each situation,evaluate the actions in question when dealing with a crush who makes you jealous you might wonder if his efforts at jealousy are intentional or accidental and if you don t ask yourself this question you probably should your crush might flirt with other girls in front of you to get your attention but it s also possible that he s just a natural flirt who does it without thinking this issue typically occurs when the guy in question flirts with you and several other girls it can be hard to know if he genuinely likes you or if he s flirting indiscriminately to figure out if he might like you more than the other girls he flirts with ask yourself if there s a difference between his flirtation with you and his flirtation with

how to tell someone you re not interested,one of the hardest parts of dating is telling someone you don t want to go out with them whether they re asking for the first time or you ve shared a few dates you likely feel uncomfortable telling them you aren t interested however you have a right to do what s best for you so be honest and direct about how you feel,tell them you appreciate their offer or attention this can take some of the sting out of the rejection you don t need to give them an elaborate thank you a single sentence is enough to convey that you re appreciative of the thought 1 x research source say thanks for complimenting my dress or that s a really nice offer you don t have to thank them if they re making you feel uncomfortable you don t want to send them the message that their behavior is okay give them an honest and clear rejection it may be tempting to be vague about how you feel in order to spare their feelings but this will be worse in the long run in addition to leading them on you ll likely find yourself having to reject them again in the future 2 x research source you might say i don t see you that way or that s not something i m interested in avoid apologizing for turning them down you don t owe anyone an apology for feeling the way you do additionally saying you re sorry makes it seem like you re pitying them which can hurt their feelings more 3 x research source instead of saying i m sorry i m not interested just say i m not interested in dinner but i really appreciate the offer don t try to force them to be friends with you if someone you re already friends with has developed feelings for you it s difficult to let go of that friendship sometimes you genuinely want to be friends with someone you re not interested in dating however maintaining a friendship can be cruel to them let them decide what s best for their life just as you get to decide what s best for you 4 x research source you might say i hope we can still be friends but i understand if you need your space save excuses for when you re rejecting a stranger it s best to avoid giving someone excuses but they can be useful if the person is someone you just met however using an excuse opens you up to getting caught in a lie if you re going to use an excuse choose one that doesn t leave room for arguing and exit the conversation as soon as you give it 5 x research source for example you might give an excuse if a stranger asks you out in public as it provides an easy way out however if you have mutual friends in common with the person giving them an excuse might come back to bite you if they talk to your friends it s usually better to be direct typical excuses include i m not ready to date anyone right now i m seeing someone i m just too busy right now or i just got out of a relationship plan out what you ll say in advance if you can knowing what you want to say can help you let them down nicely think about the reasons why you don t want to be with them then focus on the most important issue consider how you can share this issues with them in the kindest words possible 6 x research source for example you might not feel attracted to the person physically it s not kind to tell them all of the things you don t like about them instead you might practice saying i just don t feel any chemistry or that spark is missing similarly you might feel like they talk too much in this case you could say i feel like we don t communicate the same way start the conversation by giving them a compliment saying something nice can ease the pain of the rejection but don t spend too much time telling them how great they are otherwise they may question why you don t want to continue seeing them also your words might seem hollow when you reject them after telling them how wonderful you think they are 7 x research source give them a 1 sentence compliment like you planned such a fun first date or i really enjoyed talking to you about movies because you re so insightful thank them for the dates you ve had this acknowledges the time they ve put into getting to know you it shows them that you re thinking about their feelings even though what you have to say might hurt 8 x research source for instance you could say thank you for these past few dates i ve enjoyed getting to know you tell them things aren t working for you it s up to you if you want to give specific things that aren t working for you if you just didn t click with the person you might simply state that however if you ve gone on a couple of dates it might be helpful to give them a more specific reason 9 x research source say while i had fun i don t see this relationship going anywhere i feel like we have different goals and we just don t seem to be on the same path in life listen to them if they don t agree with you but stand your ground they may not feel the same way as you do and that s okay it s nice to let them share their thoughts on the issue but don t agree to keep dating them if that s not what you want instead acknowledge how they feel but restate your intention to break things off 10 x research source as an example you might say i can understand why you feel like we should go on another date but that s not what s right for me avoid listing off the reasons why you don t want to date them being honest with someone doesn t mean being hurtful in most cases there s no reason to tell someone what you don t like about them doing so will just make your rejection of them feel worse 11 x research source in some cases you might feel like telling them why you re breaking up with them will help them improve themself however keep in mind that it isn t your place to tell someone who they should be additionally everyone has different preferences so what annoys you might be attractive to someone else,Relationships

wants to see you because this can say a lot about his intentions 1 x research source consider where he wants to spend time with you if he only wants to be in the bedroom that s a huge red flag if he never wants to take you around his friends but would rather always be alone in his home that may mean he isn t interested in making you a public and official part of his life 2 x research source jot down a list of all these red flags and warning signs think about the details of each consider things like how often he says or does something that bothers you or makes you uneasy making a list is a great way to gather your thoughts and voice the concerns that may have only been brewing in your head up until now 3 x research source is this a repeated behavior or are you holding a grudge over something he did once six months ago while you should look out for yourself and stand your ground there are also times when you have to be willing to forgive and forget if he s said sorry forgetting

going out during the daytime when he initiates physical intimacy remind him that you aren t interested right now ask him to respect your boundaries 4 x research source if you aren t sure what to say to him say i want to focus on our emotional connection so let s hold off on the physical stuff for now his reaction will let you know if he s using you or not if he cares about furthering the relationship without sex he will stick around if he doesn t want to be with you if he isn t getting the physical intimacy he wants ditch him remember it is your body the most important thing is that when you say no your boyfriend respects that protect your money if you think that s what your boyfriend wants tell him that you don t feel comfortable spending money anymore and give an excuse if you need to it s completely understandable if your boyfriend doesn t have the money to spoil you but it s not ok if he demands that you spoil him if the interest is gone when your money is gone that s bad tell your boyfriend i really need to start saving my money so i am going to cut back my spending a lot then if he asks you for money or to pay for something you can remind him of this again his reaction will tell you what you need to know the same approach can be taken with any other thing your boyfriend might be using you for such as popularity gifts etc it may seem tough at first but a quality boyfriend will stick it out if he thinks the relationship is worth it notice the things he does for you when you feel like you re blissfully in love you may not notice if your boyfriend isn t doing anything for you it s easy to be so infatuated with someone that you make excuses for them however start paying attention to the things he does or doesn t do for you this doesn t necessarily mean bouquets of roses and fancy dinners this just means basic ways of showing he cares for example does he make any simple yet meaningful gestures such as bringing you a coffee when he knows you are tired or sending you an encouraging text message when he knows you are having a bad day recognize the difference between sweet compliments and flattery if he tells you he loves your sense of humor and wants to listen to your problems he probably genuinely cares if he raves about your beauty right before asking for a favor watch out 5 x research source take special note of the things he does when he gets no benefit in return if he does nice things simply to make you feel good that s a great sign take some time to be alone you don t have to make a big announcement to your boyfriend that you need a

and cursing at him lay out your concerns be blunt but do not attack him don t minimize how you ve felt or sweep any of your feelings under the rug your emotions are valid and you shouldn t shy away from expressing yourself just because it may be uncomfortable by laying your feelings out on the table you allow him to give an explanation to comfort you to fess up or to improve his behavior start your sentences with i instead of you so he doesn t think you are attacking him saying something like i feel sad when we only spend time together at night will sound better to your boyfriend than you

how to tell someone you don t want to date them without hurting them,when someone asks you out or expresses an interest in you but you don t feel the same way handling the situation can be difficult and stressful whether that person is a friend or not you don t want to hurt their feelings at the same time you want to be very clear that you aren t interested rejection is never easy but you can manage the situation in the best way possible by responding compassionately yet unambiguously,express that you are flattered but not interested whether you are interested in the person or not being asked out is always a compliment that person thinks you are worth risking possible rejection and embarrassment for and although they could have chosen literally anyone in the world to be interested in they picked you it takes a lot of courage to put yourself out there like that smile and say thank you express gratitude that the other person thought of you in that way but clearly state that although you appreciate it you aren t interested for example try saying something simple like thanks i m really flattered that you asked me out but i m not interested in you in that way pause for a beat before you say no if you are put on the spot at least pause for a moment before verbally shutting the person down this shows them that you actually considered their question even if you didn t saying no without a trace of hesitation can definitely hurt someone s feelings 1 x research source say as little as possible when it comes to turning someone down less is usually more lengthy rejections and rambling explanations can open the conversation up to debate and misinterpretation 2 x research source you don t need to elaborate at length so keep your rejection short and sweet the more you say the more false it will feel to the other person and the more it prolongs an already awkward conversation fib skillfully if you re going to make up an excuse at least make sure to use something that is believable and doesn t have a loophole for instance i just got a promotion and i want to focus on my work or i want to prioritize my friendships is much stronger than i m really busy this week or i m just not ready to date right now 3 x research source use i statements instead of using language describing why you don t want them try putting the focus on yourself instead simple statements such as i don t see you that way i m sorry and i really like you as a person but i don t feel a connection between us are easier to digest than you aren t my type end the conversation gracefully both of you are probably feeling awkward and uncomfortable at this point but try to end the conversation on a positive or lighthearted note if it seems appropriate try using a little humor at the very least offer a sincere smile and excuse yourself make a quick exit continuing the conversation or hanging around after the deed is done can be confusing and unpleasant for the other person 4 x research source you might want to keep the conversation going in an effort to try to act normal and make the other person feel better about the rejection but the kindest thing to do is end the encounter as soon as possible keep the matter private there is no reason to discuss the matter at all with co workers or at length with your friends be respectful of the other person s feelings being rejected is difficult enough without having to navigate the additional problem of feeling ashamed about it in front of other people confront the issue rejecting someone is usually extremely awkward for both parties involved and it can be tempting to ignore the situation entirely if you pretend it s not happening it will magically go away right unfortunately allowing silence to be your answer and hoping the other person will eventually get the hint is both cruel and a poor strategy that often backfires 5 x research source give them a firm answer as soon as possible 6 x research source avoid waiting for the right time because there usually is no right time the longer you wait the harder and more awkward the rejection will be for both of you 7 x research source it can make it difficult for the other person to move on if they don t receive a firm and clear no from you so the kindest thing you can do is provide that to them 8 x research source it may sting a little at first but in the long run you ll both be happier for it avoid ghosting ghosting is a relatively new term to describe an age old way of rejecting someone by disappearing completely after an initial encounter whether that s one date or several 9 x research source rather than confronting the issue the initiator permanently withdraws completely with no explanation ever vanishing completely without ever addressing the issue is doing exactly what you are trying to avoid hurting that person s feelings in a 2012 study researchers identified seven breakup strategies and then asked people to rate them from most to least ideal ghosting was overwhelmingly identified as the least ideal way to break it off with someone 10 x research source respond to strangers and acquaintances via text unless you ve known this person for a long time or have already been dating them for several months letting them down gently via text is not only acceptable but also preferable the blow of rejection is softened by the neutrality of a text and allows the person to nurse their momentarily bruised ego in private there is no reason to make physical contact with someone you don t know well just to turn them down 11 x research source in some cases such as when it comes to being approached online or by someone you work with that you rarely see and hardly know even an email will suffice as a rejection respond to friends and co workers in person anyone that you know personally or see every day such as a friend or co worker deserves a face to face response this will also make inevitable future encounters far less awkward delivering the news in person allows the other person to see your facial expressions body language and hear the tone of your voice 12 x research source be firm and absolute avoid wavering and appearing indecisive which can confuse the other person if you re firm when you turn them down the first time you probably won t have to have the conversation twice 13 x research source an ambiguous reaction from you could make the person feel like they still have a chance which wastes their time and isn t fair to them it also increases the likelihood that you ll need to repeat this awkward conversation with them in the future speak kindly and directly approach them with a smile and keep your demeanor as calm and relaxed as possible use positive body language such as sitting or standing up straight and looking the other person directly in the eye to convey that you are serious 14 x research source negative body language like slumping or not looking them in the eye indicates a lack of confidence in your own words 15 x research source don t offer false hope if you truly aren t interested in dating this person make that fact clear statements like i m too busy with work right now or i just got out of a long

element of mystery in your relationship and also an element of excitement if your crush tells you every little thing on his or her mind or every little problem he or she has then your crush isn t trying to impress you or cover things up and this is probably because he or she sees you as a friend if your crush says something like i wanted to call you the second this happened or your opinion means so much to me or i m so glad i can count on you these are all signs that he or she thinks of you as a really really good friend see if your crush tells you about other people he or she likes this is a dead giveaway that the person only sees you as a friend if your crush goes on and on about how much he likes his cute coworker or how much she wants a new guy in school to ask her out then you are definitely in the friend zone if the person asks you for advice again and again and never once thinks that you might be interested then you are definitely in the friend zone if your crush talks to you about other romantic opportunities then you are probably in the friend zone however if you hear him or her saying things like none of the guys in my class are as good as you or i just feel like i ll never find the right person then this may be a hint that you re the one see if your crush has friendly nicknames for you if your crush likes to pal around with you and gives you cute but corny nicknames such as buddy brother sister champ slugger or kiddo then yeah you won t be feeling the love any time soon this doesn t mean that the person will never be able to see you romantically but that right now you are firmly entrenched in the friend zone 1 x research source see if you end up consoling your crush through a break up this is another red flag that you are absolutely in the friend zone if the girl or guy you like just got dumped and you re the one who is there consoling him or her with a tub of ice cream and a love actually dvd then you are deeply entrenched in the friend zone if you re the one saying things like you can do so much better and how could anyone not want to be with you then you are definitely just a friend if your crush really opens up to you and lets you see him or her during such a vulnerable time then you are probably just a friend see if your crush is comfortable dressing around you if he or she dresses in front of you without any romantic undertones he or she is probably not attracted to you and may assume you are not at all attracted to them if you re heading to the pool together at the beach together or just hanging out and your crush does this without thinking twice then you may be in the friend zone 2 x research source if your crush changes around you or even wears less clothes around you like if you re at the beach pay attention to how he or she acts when this happens does the guy you like look down at his chest when he takes his shirt off does the girl you like nervously adjust her bikini when you re at the beach together if so then he or she may be feeling a bit self conscious in your presence consider whether you ve ever shared a bed without taking part in any cuddling or holding hands this is friend or even sibling behavior if you find yourself in the same bed with your crush and you re on opposite ends or perfectly comfortable splaying out on the bed then you are in the friend zone though this may not happen too often it s an opportunity to see where your relationship really stands if your crush wears dorky pajamas or his or her retainer then it s even more likely that you re in the friend zone if your crush seems to have no incentive to look sexy around you then it s because he or she only sees you as a friend consider whether he or she has told his or her entire family about you if the family asks why you two haven t started a relationship you are probably in the friend zone because you are a couple in every way except romantically and sexually if your crush s family always putting the pressure on for you to date and you already know everyone there pretty well then there s a pretty good chance you re in the friend zone if your crush had special feelings for you then having you meet his or her family would be considered a big deal of course you should keep in mind that feelings do change maybe you met your crush s family a long time ago and only now he or she is starting to have feelings see if your crush is perfectly comfortable around you this is another sign that you are in the friend zone if your relationship is romantic then your crush will be nervous around you at least to an extent he or she will fidget occasionally laugh when nothing is funny or go out of his or her way to impress you if your crush only sees you as a friend then he or she won t care about his or her appearance or about how he or she comes off if you never detect any nervousness preening or worry whatsoever when you re together then you are probably just a friend if your crush says anything without censoring him or herself backtracking or wondering how he or she comes off then you are most likely just friends check out how your crush dresses when you hang out if you get the sense that he or she hasn t tried to look nice wear makeup or put on cute clothes around you then it s probably because he or she thinks of you as just being friends see if your crush tries to set you up with other people this is another dead giveaway that you re in the friend zone if the girl you like is always telling you about the cute girl in her math class or her cute second cousin that you d be perfect for then this is a big red flag it s even worse if you show up to hang out with her and she brings along a random girlfriend clearly with the intention of setting the two of you up together think about it if the girl liked you why would she be trying to set you up with someone else this may even be the person s way of hinting that you should direct your romantic feelings elsewhere see if you always end up doing what your crush wants to do if the girl you like really likes you then she ll go out of her way to do the things you want to do whether it s going hiking or watching a baseball game but if you always get roped in to going shopping getting ice cream or doing other things that she wants to do then it may be because because she doesn t care about impressing you ask yourself when the last time was that you got your crush to do something that you actually wanted to do this is especially true if you always end up shopping with the girl you like if she s asking your what she should wear or how she looks in a certain outfit then it s probably because she doesn t think of you as dating material see if you and your crush make physical contact a lot if the guy or girl you like returns your romantic feelings then you ll probably be touching each other a fair amount whether you re playfully hitting each other or finding other excuses to graze arms or fingers if you never end up touching each other even when it s easy to do so such as when you re sharing the same menu then it may be because your crush just doesn t think of you that way however if you like a guy who treats you like one of the bros then there may be a fair amount of touching try to see if it s just friendly or something more you can even test this out by finding an excuse to lightly graze your crush s arm or to playfully shove her just to see if she responds see if you do favors for your crush if you find yourself walking your crush s dog picking up lunch for her when she s having a busy day or giving her a ride to school then your relationship is probably not romantic if you re already an errand boy or girl for this person then you are definitely not on your way to dating if your crush really had romantic feelings for you then she wouldn t ask you to help her out in non romantic ways all the time see if your crush always ends up inviting other people out when you re together if you re always trying to get your crush alone so you can turn your relationship into something more while she always ends up inviting the whole gang her three siblings her random neighbors and anyone else in the same city then it s a sign that your crush does not see you taking your relationship to a romantic level this doesn t mean that it will never happen but it does mean that for now your relationship is not in a romantic place 3 x research source if your crush sees you as a romantic prospect then he or she would be looking for excuses to be alone with you not

if you aren t attracted to him but want to be friends say i had a lot of fun with you but i didn t really feel a romantic connection would you like to be friends with me asking him if he wants to be friends is straightforward and lets him know that even though you don t want to date you still appreciate interactions with him tell him sooner rather than later once you know that you re not into a

save you from agonizing over when to tell him keep your distance once you ve told him that you re no longer interested don t keep talking to him even if you both want to be friends it can be good to have a little distance at first if he continually texts you after you ve rejected him it s okay to ignore the messages if you do talk to him be careful to avoid flirting or confusing

spend some time affirming yourself in the mirror you could say i love the soft wave of my hair building your confidence this way can help you get over some of your insecurities play it cool on a date that is maybe you shouldn t wear your tallest heels if you re going on a first date with a short guy that doesn t mean you should slouch own your height however there s no need to draw attention to the height difference by adding more inches also try to skip any comments about the height difference unless he brings it up with a joke don t crack jokes about his height just like you probably don t like people cracking jokes because you re tall he probably doesn t like hearing jokes about how short he is try to skip the wisecracks particularly when you re first starting out 3 x research source work on your bias if you ve mostly dated guys who are taller than you it may take you some time to adjust and that s okay you can even date other guys while you re adjusting as long as you all agree you re not exclusive give yourself the time you need to get to know him and adjust your feelings about his height 4 x research source remind yourself that him being shorter than you doesn t make him less of a man and that you being taller than him doesn t make you less of a woman focus on what you like about him that is if you re concerned about the height difference you re somewhat focused on the externals instead think about what you like about him as a person such as his charm his wit his intelligence or his compassion you can t build a relationship on height alone but you can build a relationship on personality 5 x research source notice how easy it is to kiss him if you have a guy who s significantly taller than you you really have to strain to kiss him with a shorter guy you re more likely to be closer in height making kissing easier pay attention when you re saying goodnight to him and appreciate the fact that you can kiss him without pulling a muscle 6 x research source look at the data height really does open some doors so guys who are shorter have to work harder to get ahead that turns out to be a bonus for you because studies have shown that shorter guys usually do more of the housework than taller guys 7 x research source appreciate how he increases your height while at first being taller than your boyfriend may make you feel tall and out of place try to look at it another way that is most models are on the taller side so standing next to him makes you look more like a model not tall and gangly 8 x research source observe other happy couples while a short guy with a tall girl isn t as common as the opposite a short girl and tall guy you ll find many happy couples in the world who are similar in heights to you and your guy once you ve observed a few couples whether ones you know a couple in public or even celebrities you ll likely find that they don t care at all about the height difference rather they just care about loving each other 9 x research source decide you won t let others get you down about your height that is when you re trying to meet guys or when you re going out with a shorter guy you shouldn t feel you need to hide your height most people find confidence sexy so don t try to slouch or hunch over as that will just make you appear like you re ashamed of it instead stand up straight look people in the eye and flash a big smile 10 x research source of course once you re dating someone you may decide you want to even out your heights a bit but that is totally up to you skip the heels if you don t want to emphasize your height difference you can stick to flats most of the time rather than wearing heels as a bonus you re feet likely won t hurt as much 11 x research source if you want to wear heels try a shorter pair rather than the 4 to 5 inch variety practice the lean one way to even out your height differences particularly when you re wearing heels is to lean a little bit to the side by sticking out a hip obviously you need something to lean on such as your boyfriend you don t want to slouch rather you just want to look casual putting you at a more even height with your boyfriend 12 x research

about restaurants huh or do you believe two people can be friends without ever catching feelings for each other 6 x research source pay attention to her facial expression and body language in addition to her verbal response if she seems to shut down or dismiss the idea this may indicate she s not interested think about what you will say in advance if you re still thinking about sharing your

you feel pressured set clear boundaries whether your best friend embraced your romantic feelings or rejected your advances the two of you need to figure out where your friendship stands set boundaries with one another moving forward so that you re on the same page 11 x research source for instance if she didn t feel the same way you might set a boundary that you no longer hang out with her alone

reserving it all for your best friend start spending time with others too plan a fun game night attend a friend s sporting event or join a new club 12 x research source this is important to do whether

how to find out if a guy has a girlfriend,sometimes guys can be confusing as to whether they might like you or if they have a girlfriend it s good to find out if the guy you re crushing on is taken or not but it s also important to find out if the guy you ve been casually dating has a girlfriend that you don t know about pay attention so that you can avoid drama and heartache,listen to how he talks around you guys don t always make it obvious when they re in a relationship but pay attention if he uses pronouns like we and us when talking about his past weekend or upcoming plans as there may be another girl in the picture he may also talk a lot about a certain girl without ever explaining that they re exclusively together 1 x research source if a guy refuses to flirt back with you it either means that he s not interested in you or has a girlfriend or both some guys are notoriously flirty or charming to everyone they meet even if they have a girlfriend don t get swept up in the fun of flirting until you know a guy is single a guy can still be nice and courteous to you even if they have a girlfriend don t mistake niceness and politeness for flirting pay attention to the body language he uses around you some guys are very physical with everyone they like but guys with girlfriends will often refrain from being touchy with other girls he may only hug his guy friends or female relatives if he avoids your attempts to hug him or sit close to him then he might be taken 2 x research source don t force him to hold your hand hug you or do anything physical if you notice that he turns away or back away from you you don t want to seem like a home wrecker if he s in a relationship he might give hugs or high fives to everyone regardless of having a girlfriend so don t use this as your only gauge for determining if he has a girlfriend if you notice that he deliberately avoids being alone with you it may be that he s worried about keeping his reputation as a taken guy decide if he has put you in the friend zone a guy usually reserves his time and romantic efforts for a girlfriend if the guy you re interested in treats you like one of the guys and doesn t seem to set aside time to hang out with you he might be taken for example a guy will deliberately introduce you as his friend to other people or call you dude bud pal or any other non committal nickname to label you as just a friend girlfriends usually have the privilege of a guy s time on weekend nights if you can never schedule time with the guy it could be because he reserves most of his free time for his girlfriend 3 x research source he might mention special events or time spent with family that he s attending without inviting you it s possible that he is going with a girlfriend who usually takes priority see if he treats you like a secret if you re dealing with a guy who you suspect is cheating on his girlfriend and you re the other woman observe him carefully changing your name in his phone giving you shady answers about where he s been or is going or restricting when you can call or text him might mean that he s trying to hide you from a girlfriend 4 x research source if he hasn t introduced you to his friends family or coworkers it could be that he doesn t want anyone to know that you re in the picture it s may not be your place to alert the girlfriend that this guy is cheating on her it may backfire on you back out of the situation so that you re not part of the problem determine how he spends his time generally a guy will spend the majority of his free time with his girlfriend however if hanging out with you or his guy friends takes up most of his schedule he might not have other priorities when you ask him what his evening or weekend plans are and he s free it may be that he doesn t have a steady girlfriend check his social media pages one of the easiest ways to subtly find out if a guy is in a relationship is to check his facebook twitter or instagram profiles 5 x research source see if he mentions hanging out with a specific girl more than usual or posts photos with a certain girl you can also simply check his profile descriptions to see is he mentions being in a relationship check his friends pages as well sometimes a guy won t post photos of a relationship but you can check his mutual friends and followers pages to see if they posted pictures of him with another girl be careful not to like or accidentally comment on any old pictures or posts of his he ll get a notification that you re stalking him although its increasingly unusual it is possible that your guy may not have a social media page in which case it may be more beneficial to check his friend s pages to see if they posted any information about the guy check his phone for evidence of a girlfriend guys are just as guilty as girls when it comes to keeping pictures and messages of a special girl in their life you can ask to borrow his phone and surreptitiously scroll through his photo albums and texts to see if he has a girlfriend say that your phone s battery died and you have to make a call if you re trying to avoid being suspicious don t abuse his privacy if you sneak through his phone or log onto his social media profiles without permission you could get caught it s never a good idea to be invasive and stalk someone s life watch to see if he checks out other girls guys who are in a relationship rarely pay a whole lot of attention to other women a faithful boyfriend won t check out other girls as they walk by or make comments about a woman s appearance to his friends 6 x research source on the other hand if you have evidence that he might have a girlfriend but still hits on other women he might be a cheater so be wary if he gives out his number to other girls he may be single your only challenge is to catch his attention pay attention to his flirting if your crush seems to flirt with any girl including you he might be single but some guys are charming and witty no matter who they re talking to it can be easy to confuse being nice for flirting he might have a girlfriend but still treat everyone with individualized attention don t confuse being nice and funny with flirting the main difference is that flirting usually involves physical touch and subtle hints about something more than friendship ask his friends sometimes a guy is just really hard to read or is very private about his life find one of his friends and ask them if your crush has a girlfriend slip the question into a conversation to be subtle or just outright message one of his friends if you want to be direct 7 x research source try to be subtle when asking you can say things like what does your friend do with all of his time or make a joke like oh where s he going got a hot date be aware that your questioning may make it back to the guy you re interested in guys talk among themselves just as much as girls however if your interest is single tipping him off that you like him and have been talking to his friends is a way to get his attention ask him in person if he has a girlfriend if you still can t find out if he is dating another girl ask him outright avoid texting instant messaging or anything electronic because it s important that you re able to hear how he reacts to your question wait for a good time to ask if you re hanging out with a group of people you shouldn t delve into someone s personal relationship status be patient and wait until it s just the two of you to inquire about any girlfriend you don t want to make him uncomfortable by making his personal life public in front of people be direct when asking him about a possible girlfriend try not to beat around the bush when you ask to avoid making things too awkward you could say i ve been meaning to ask you do you have a girlfriend as long as you keep your tone casual he shouldn t feel pressured by your question if he doesn t and has been oblivious that you have a crush on him he may notice your interest when you ask him about his relationship status don t worry too much if he says yes there will always be other guys not all the good ones are taken notice if he avoids your question it s not a good sign if he doesn t answer you with a simple yes or no any hint of caginess or nervousness is not a good sign if he stumbles over his words or tries to give you an excuse he s probably in a complicated situation it s best to stay away from a guy who isn t honest anyways 8 x research source if he s outright and honest then you have a clear answer but if he hesitates take that as a red flag that he may be hiding his relationship react respectfully and maturely no matter the answer he gives finding out that a guy you re interested in is taken can be a tough blow but keep cool when he gives you an answer whether it s positive or negative if he has a girlfriend don t have a meltdown in front of him or at least wait until you re alone to be emotional about a missed opportunity so you can save face the best news would be if he s single respond with something like oh well that s interesting to maintain your mysteriousness and not reveal your hand that you re interested in him no matter how much you like a guy it s not worth breaking up a relationship just so you can try and date him,Relationships
how to date a man who has a child when you don t,you re dating a man and he has children these days it s becoming more and more common for someone to enter a relationship with children from a previous marriage but how do you deal with this situation when you don t have any children of your own,be honest with yourself assess your own needs know from the start what you truly expect from this relationship ask yourself whether you intend to pursue and commit to a lifelong relationship with the father or whether you re only interested in a casual relationship expect grief whether the father is a widower a divorcee or a parent out of wedlock know that he s most likely in a period of mourning for his previous relationship 1 x research source 2 x research source also be aware that men are more likely than women to hide their feelings 3 x research source so don t assume everything s fine just because he says it is if you re interested in pursuing a longterm relationship invite him to openly discuss his loss use your conversations to evaluate how well he s coping with it 4 x research source accept second place in the beginning embrace early on that his child should be his 1 priority be flexible when scheduling your own quality time with him 5 x research source appreciate the fact that his money should be earmarked first and foremost for his child s needs this may sound like a bummer but think of it as an excellent way to judge the father s character whether he s a widower divorced or otherwise estranged from the mother imagine that you re the mother in this situation ask yourself if he s acting as responsibly toward his child as you would expect him to act toward your own if he s showering you with time money and attention while neglecting his kid consider that a red flag remember this is only temporary look forward to becoming an equal member of the family as you gradually integrate over time know that you re beginning more than one relationship if you re expecting your relationship with the father to become permanent be prepared to have one with the child and mother as well 6 x research source even if the mother has passed on or is largely absent from your own life they will still maintain a large presence in both the father and child s mind 7 x research source 8 x research source ask the father early on about the family s history learn about both the child and the mother before you meet them their character their interests their strengths and weaknesses etc use the father s answers to better understand the man you re dating for instance while he may have criticisms about the mother that are perfectly valid be wary if he places 100 of the blame for everything that s ever gone wrong entirely on her judge for yourself how well he s able to assess a situation objectively and accept responsibility for his part in it expect the unexpected know that you ll be facing many more variables than you would be in a relationship with a single man without children understand that the father s relationship with the mother may change over time for better or for worse appreciate the fact that the child s thoughts and feelings may alter as well both as they age and as your own status in their lives changes expect to face far more stress and challenges than you ve grown accustomed to in childless relationships 9 x research source think positively while it s important to be realistic about the situation that you re entering don t let challenges and stress dissuade you from pursuing a future with the father if you think it s worth it remember that challenges met and overcome can be rewarding experiences in their own right realize that you won t be sharing firsts whether you re hoping to marry the father and or have children of your own accept the fact that the father has already achieved one or both of these milestones ask yourself how much importance you really place on reaching these steps together as mutual firsts in your life journey 10 x research source at the same time consider the fact that you ll have a partner who has prior concrete experience with things that for now are only hypothetical for you personally whether it s committing to a long term relationship or having another child you ll have a partner with more intimate knowledge about the situation as a whole and what to expect as well as more self knowledge about his own capabilities in that situation reassess your needs once you ve considered the reality of dating a single father reevaluate what you honestly need from a relationship based on that ask yourself if you can really expect those needs to be fulfilled in these circumstances decide then whether to walk away or continue dating if you re only seeking a casual relationship let the father know if he s fine with that continue to date without involving yourself at all in the child s life if you want to keep things casual but he wants more or if you d like to pursue a deeper relationship as well but feel way too daunted by the circumstances let him know that there s a conflict of interest here tell him that while you like him just fine the situation is simply too much for you don t allow yourself to be backed into a situation that you can t handle if you re willing to commit to a long term relationship and become part of the child s life find out as much as you can about what you re walking into ask other people in similar circumstances about their own experiences seek professional help about what to expect find out more about the child and their mother both from the father and from any other mutual acquaintances you may have for a more rounded view every situation is different so learn as much as you can about your own before taking the bigger plunge ask what he expects of you talk about his own needs know from the start what he expects from your relationship together as well as your future relationship with his child 11 x research source define your own limits resist the urge to please avoid taking on more responsibility than you re comfortable with or obligated to accept clearly define yourself as a source of support for him the parent and not a parent yourself 12 x research source due to learned gender roles widowers and male divorcees may often finding themselves lacking in certain parental skills possessed by the mother 13 x research source to compensate the father may hope for you to step in and fill the mother s role whether or not he s even conscious of it make it clear to him that his duty is to learn these skills himself and not merely replace the mother with you 14 x research source take it slowly whether you re dating casually or already madly in love avoid rushing into the relationship at any step appreciate the fact that your status as a couple will almost certainly be an upheaval in his child s life avoid upsetting the child s world by stepping into it too quickly communicate constantly emphasize honesty for the child s sake accept the fact that your situation will produce a large amount of stress and potentially negative feelings express any doubts or misgivings that either you or the father may have know where each of you stand at any given point in time especially before making the larger step of involving yourself in his child s life 15 x research source ask the father about their relationship know where they stand with each other find out whether their split was amicable bitter or somewhere in between 16 x research source if their current relationship is openly vicious brace yourself for the extra drama and stress that this will undoubtedly add to your own relationships with the father and his child 17 x research source if their current relationship is quite friendly politely but firmly establish yourself as the father s new partner appreciate the fact that the two have a prior intimacy that may inform their interactions but don t be afraid to speak up when you believe either one has crossed a line 18 x research source respect her role remember that she s the child s parent understand that she will always occupy a space in the child s life and vice versa accept the fact that to some degree you will have to hold yourself accountable to her as a presence in her child s life 19 x research source even if she s a negligent or otherwise poor parent remember that her status as mother will never change don t feel obligated to respect the woman but do respect the fact that she will always play some sort of role in both the father and child s life be polite even if you can t stand each other make a point of being civil earn respect and or the moral high ground by showing respect in order to better ensure a positive atmosphere for all concerned especially the child 20 x research source also be aware that the child will feel more loyalty toward their mother than they will toward you 21 x research source earn their respect by always treating their mother with courtesy honor the deceased if the father is a widower accept the mother s continued presence in both his life and the child s allow them to speak freely of her so they can honor her memory and so you can evaluate how each is coping with their loss although a jealous twinge here and there may be a perfectly natural knee jerk reaction avoid poisoning your relationships by making the father and or child feel like they must suppress her memory in your presence 22 x research source talk it over with the father first be sure of your own relationship before beginning one with his child if either one of you still feels more casual than committed toward the other forego any involvement with the kid avoid disrupting the child s life prematurely or unnecessarily 23 x research source wait a little longer if you and the father both feel ready for you to meet his child give yourself some extra time before actually doing it allow yourself more time to get cold feet if you do have second thoughts ask yourself whether it s just jitters or a sign that you re really not quite ready for this keep it simple take a baby step approach to entering their life for your first introduction plan no more than an opportunity to say hi to the child and then introduce yourself as a friend of their dad s 24 x research source choose a low key setting to meet keep it casual as opposed to a formal setting where you would be clearly identified as the father s date pick a time and place that are both clearly part of the father and child s time together rather than a date between yourselves with the child in tow plan to make a brief appearance and then exit by yourself leaving them alone together so that your presence comes across as incidental avoid leaving the child with the impression that you re taking daddy away take it slowly increase the time you spend together very gradually pop up here and there to say hi and establish that you re a presence in dad s life but limit your exposure in the beginning so that the majority of the kid s time with dad is spent one on one with him 25 x research source imagine the child s perspective as you spend more time with them remain conscious of what impressions the child might take away from your encounters prioritize the father child relationship be careful not to come across as competition for dad s attention 26 x research source establish your role once you and the father have made the child aware of your relationship assume your role as the father s new partner make it clear to the child that you re not here to be the new mom or another dad equate yourself with the role of aunt uncle or a similarly respected adult figure with an invested interest in their well being like a teacher 27 x research source keep taking it slowly allow the child time to accept your new role in their life understand that even once they do accept it their acceptance may not develop into an emotional bond accept this as a reality avoid trying to force a bond between you 28 x research source in the meantime be present and consistent in their lives offering yourself as an added resource for them should they ever choose to make use of it maintain your role when challenged no matter how well adjusted or behaved the child is expect them to act out at times as all children do 29 x research source be prepared for a delicate balancing act when confronting the child expect to hear that you are not their mom or dad accept the truth of that statement 30 x research source at the same time assert yourself as an adult figure to whom they must show some respect demand support from the father remind him that while your role is to support him as a parent his role is to be the parent don t allow yourself to be backed into the position of being the disciplinarian by default respect the mother in their child s presence remember that they will most likely continue to feel more loyalty toward their mother than toward you 31 x research source regardless of your personal feelings toward her be careful what you utter within earshot of their child don t lose the child s respect by disrespecting their mother in front of them be patient accept the fact that your new role in the child s life will test them continually expect them to take a while to accept your presence also expect their progress to be upset by each milestone that you and their father achieve for instance while they may have grown to accept your role as dad s new partner they may be knocked back a couple steps once you and dad announce that you

handwritten notes passed back and forth can accomplish this goal make your plan and prepare punctually waiting until the last minute to pick up her gift or to make reservations at the restaurant or to ask your boss for time off so that you can meet her at the movies is going to stress you out and create situations where you have to settle for the second or third best option for the day no

may 2019 and when she does respond she might make up an excuse about how incredibly busy she was she ll say she was at a party or hanging out with someone she s showing you that she s a busy girl and is not entirely dependent on spending time with you her delayed responses should happen consistently and almost strategically if she doesn t respond to you for days or makes up a weird excuse it probably means she s not interested enough to respond back in time some girls just don t respond to texts or calls right away don t overanalyze this or get upset with her if she s showing signs of being interested in you take a breath and understand that people are often busy or forgetful watch if she shows you your competition a girl playing hard to get will want to look hard to get it s her way of showing you she has many options to choose from and could be taken by someone else at any moment she might bring along some good looking friends to a party to make you jealous she ll tease you about people who have tried to hit on her but failed it may seem like she s ridiculing them but she s really pointing out to you how attractive she is if she talks about the people she s dating with you then she s probably not interested and might just see you as a friend don t treat this as a failure but rather as the start of a blossoming friendship however not everyone can stay friends with someone they re interested in so know when it s time to count your losses and find someone else look for physical signs of flirting even if a girl is playing hard to get it still means she s interested in you and if she is she ll be sending out subtle signs that she likes you it can be hard to tell if a girl is flirting so carefully observe her body language for these common signs of flirting 3 x research source 4 x research source she s constantly touching you she might touch your shoulder or arms while talking to you maybe she ll lean in close and rest her body against yours there ll be many excuses or reasons why both of you are always touching she smiles at you a lot she might catch your eye across the room and give you a sweet unsolicited smile she draws attention to her body she might bite her lip fix her hair or cross and uncross her legs she may be doing these things unconsciously or purposely but all these subtle moves draw your attention to a specific part of her body she gives you special hugs if she s not a hugger then it s easy to tell when she s giving a hug reserved especially for you it s an excuse to get closer to you and an affectionate expression even if you re not sure it s a special hug be happy you re receiving such a nice gesture from her listen carefully to the way she speaks to you an interested girl will attempt to give you subtle suggestions through her speech so it s important to learn to read between the lines a simple hello could have seductive intentions if you listen closely enough to the way she says it she laughs at your dumb jokes you might tell the same joke to your friends and get a nice laugh or two but when she hears it it s hilarious she wants you to feel like the star of the show but don t get this mixed up with awkward laughter she compliments you a lot according to her you re really funny kind and have nice hair however some girls might do the complete opposite and insult you this is an age old flirting technique used by almost everyone it lowers the self esteem of the target and oddly makes the insulter seem much more attractive 5 x research source but don t mistake this for a girl who is truly disinterested in you a few light hearted insults does not harm but if she s giving consistently hurtful insults then it probably means she doesn t like you watch how she acts around you versus how she acts around others she might change drastically around you whether she becomes nervous or extremely aloof or flirtatious a change in behaviour often signifies that she feels differently about you you can usually tell what her normal behaviour is like when she s around her friends if you can observe her behaviour without her knowing that you re in the room watch if she changes once she notices you she might straighten up become quiet and serious or be very happy to see you watch how her friends react around you if they re whispering giggling or sneaking glances at you it s likely you were the subject of their conversation and they re checking you out don t assume a change in behaviour means she s into you she could be playing hard to get or is just genuinely not interested play hard to get too if you re still not sure take a turn at the game it works even better if you know she s playing hard to get or is actually interested in you 6 x research source flirt with her sparingly keep her guessing if you re really interested in her it s fun for both of you and keeps things fresh and entertaining stay mysterious drop hints about yourself to keep her curious about who you are you ll look intriguing and more attractive some girls even if they re the ones playing hard to get might not appreciate this approach after all the point of playing hard to get is to force the person you re interested in to work harder for you not less instead play by her rules and show her just how much you ll do to win her affection back off and give her space ultimately you should let her decide how to let you know whether or not she likes you the worst thing you can do is become obsessed with wanting to be with her this can lead to incidents of harassment on your part no means no if she rejects your advances or tells you to stop contacting her respect her wishes and stop don t ask her out constantly or demand her attention all the time don t stalk her or her friends to find

how to tell if someone hates you,in some cases if someone feels a strong dislike for you they make it clear but often society might force them to try to hide it hate is a complicated emotion and very often someone will hate it when you do something but doesn t hate you the following tips will help you determine if someone hates you and help you act accordingly,pay attention to their eyes a lot of things that are considered too rude to be said are often communicated using eyes in fact some of our emotions are written in the size of our pupils something humans can t control if someone is frustrated by having to talk to you you can often find out by watching their eyes looking up and to the right is a sign of boredom pupils dilate get bigger when a person is interested and will often decrease in size when someone becomes bored 1 x research source avoiding eye contact probably means they re hiding something from you that they don t trust you or are scared of you 2 x research source notice extremes any extreme emotion can be a sign that something is wrong with your relationship however you should pay attention to extremes as compared to how this person usually behaves not what you consider normal for yourself or your friends pay attention to tension and stiffness especially in the shoulders boredom and disinterest being over the top or melodramatic the tone of their voice how quickly or slowly they respond 3 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source watch for differences people behave differently depending on how they feel about what they are saying or doing and there are many subtle and often subconscious cues that can help differentiate how people feel about something they re unwilling to discuss or will lie about the basic idea of a polygraph test also known as a lie detector is in finding the tiny differences in how someone responds when they re telling the truth as compared to when they re lying 4 x trustworthy source american psychological association leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists go to source even if you can t use a machine to monitor the differences in someone s behavior some easy cues that can help you tell if they hate you are anything that might suggest that they are lying or trying to mislead you look out for any sign of them trying to hide an emotion as people often get emotional when they lie and try to hide it 5 x trustworthy source american psychological association leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists go to source how this person communicates with you vs how they communicate with other people how they act when you re talking about something they need to pay attention to for example work if they are a co worker and when you bring up things that they don t need to talk about with you how they act when you have something they want vs how they act the rest of the time for example if you are a good student in school are they nice to you when they want help and mean the rest of the time if this is the case they probably don t like you how they behave in different situations if someone hates you they will probably behave similarly towards you in most situations unless there is another factor that forces them to pretend to like you if they behave differently in different situations perhaps there is another contributing factor and their behavior has nothing to do with how they feel about you don t mistake other emotions for hatred it can sometimes be hard to tell the difference between things like jealousy shyness fear and hatred some things to consider when deciding this are is the person quiet or shy in general do you have a position or possession they might want and be jealous of do you sometimes act pushy or demanding could they be scared of you or your reaction notice how open they are with you while everyone is different regarding how much about their personal life they share in various circumstances if someone regularly withholds information from you that has to do with what you are doing together then there is probably some issue between you 6 x research source it might not be hatred and it might be as simple as forgetfulness on their part but it is probably worth investigating why they aren t being more forthright some things that should probably be shared are anything regarding a project you are working on together information that clearly would help you do your job or be happier messages that someone else asked them to pass on to you don t take things personally keep an eye out and see if this person is rude or seems bored with everyone they interact with it might not be you at all but just how they behave with everyone look for trends if someone has only met you once or doesn t usually act like they don t like you it s probably nothing everyone has bad days and bad days can make people grumpy and act mean in order to be sure someone hates you you should pay attention to how they behave over the long run rather than focusing on one or two individual events don t confuse thoughtlessness for hatred especially if the person you re thinking about isn t someone who knows you well they might not be aware that what they are doing or saying is very upsetting to you some people have a great deal of difficulty understanding social cues and may not understand your negative reaction to their behavior similarly many people s mouths are sometimes ahead of their brains and this causes them to often say things which they later regret an indicator of either of these is that they say hurtful things to many people this isn t a sign of hatred for you it s a sign that they have a social difficulty pay attention to sources if you ve heard that someone hates you from someone else consider how accurate their information might be ask them why they think the person hates you and consider the reliability of their reasons if they are known for gossiping and spreading discord consider whether they might be telling you this to provoke excitement or whether they are trying to make things easier for everyone watch your own behavior if the person you think hates you acts mean only when you do something specific consider that it might be your behavior and not you that they hate some things that might irritate or anger people are certain topics of conversation language or symbols they might find offensive humor that they might consider inappropriate requests that they do or change something how you interact with others especially their close friends or significant others level of physical intimacy for example many people hug everyone they know and others reserve this for a select few they may be uncomfortable with how often or little you touch them ask questions if you ve noticed that someone acts annoyed or angry when you interact with them try kindly and gently asking them what it is that you re doing to upset them making it clear that you re just asking them for information and not asking them to change how they re behaving helps avoid a confrontation if you don t want to confront them personally a note or a voice message can give them time to think about how they want to respond rather than reacting instinctively which might be to defend themselves rather than solve the problem remember that even if you ask perfectly they might still lash out at you and there s nothing you can do about that some example questions are you seem really down all the time is there anything i can do to cheer you up make things easier for you i feel like you treat me differently than everyone else around here why is that i ve noticed that you seem angry when _______ is there anything i can do to make your happier have i done anything to irritate you i feel like you re angry with me and i don t understand why try to see things from their point of view consider how you would react if someone treated you the way you treat them some possibilities to consider are might they feel like you are giving them an unfair workload do you express when you are annoyed with them more than you express it when you re happy do you disagree with a lot of the things they say even if you try to hide your disagreement they may still be picking up on the fact that you re hiding an emotion and not trust you don t get angry yelling or being rude never makes a bad situation go away keep your cool and try to come to a compromise that you can both live with remember that you can t make the other person talk to you in a reasonable way and if they aren t willing to work out your disagreement there s not much you can do apart from avoid them be aware of being victimized some people who are unhappy take out their anger on people who might be totally unrelated to the source of their unhappiness it can be very difficult to tell whether someone hates you or is using you to vent their frustration but in either case it can help to stand up for yourself and not be an easy target when you are put down keep your tone of voice neutral and say something like that s a really mean thing to say why would you say that i m sorry you don t like this dress it happens to be my favorite or get really serious with something like this was my mom s favorite dress she died last year i m sorry that s upsetting to you i didn t mean to annoy you apologize if you ve done something to anger or upset someone if you started the conflict then they probably think it s your job to end it even if it was a long time ago it s never too late to try to make up,Relationships

whitewater rafting because i have always wanted to go it may seem random but fun and can bring out more conversation send him a joke if you want him to know you have a funny side if the conversation stalls out break the ice with humor show a flirty side corny side or really funny side but aim to get a laugh or smile an example of a cheesy but funny joke would be what s the difference between a poorly dressed man on a tricycle and a well dressed man on a bicycle attire 4 x research source inquire about his agenda to gauge his interest at some point if you are interested in continuing the conversation you might want to know what he is looking for you may want to know before giving him your number if he is only interested in a booty call try something cheeky like i m interested in

of connection you are looking for give him your number and offer to meet after the call if you are interested in meeting him offer your number and talk about meeting in person this way you can hear

is sure to find it host a gathering don t throw a surprise party unless you re sure your girlfriend will enjoy it this can be a great way to surprise her on her birthday or graduation day but only if she enjoys being the center of attention if she can be shy anxious or introverted choose a more intimate way to show affection remember to invite her friends and family not just your own get together

afford it and show your girlfriend that you think you can finally go on that dream vacation make sure it is a place both of you want to go not just yourself 3 x research source be the chef few gestures are quite as romantic as the home cooked meal especially if she is usually the one who does the cooking if you are confident about your cooking abilities try making your girlfriend a gourmet

enjoy if you are nervous about cooking a meal on your own surprise her by bringing up the idea of cooking a meal together the two of you can spend some fun time together and the gesture will still be romantic clean the table use matching dinnerware and light candles this will show that you aren t just getting the nightly meal out of the way but that it is a special occasion if you have roommates or live with your parents find an evening when they ll be gone for at least an hour or two to make this date all about you and her surprise her with lunch show up at her workplace or meet her at her locker with a meal from her favorite café or fast food restaurant homemade sandwiches wraps or salads also work great if showing up at her job is not an option you could pack a picnic lunch on a random weekend and take her out to eat at a park make sure to pay attention to her schedule if she normally has lunches free but has something going on during lunch every day this week then you might need to wait take her on a nice dinner date the restaurant can be a new place with good reviews or it can be an old favorite that the two of you visit less than you used to moreover if you choose a new restaurant pick one that your girlfriend has expressed an interest in or that at least serves a type of food your girlfriend enjoys share a box of chocolates if you don t feel the need for a grand romantic gesture sharing a simple box of chocolates is nice go to a chocolatier and pick out a box together keep them on your kitchen table and enjoy them over the next week discussing your favorite

how to behave after sex,sexual intercourse is one of the most intimate experiences two people can share but it s not always clear how you should act afterwards they key to channeling great sex into a great relationship is to be considerate of your partner s feelings and treat them with respect let the magic of the moment pass in its own time and find ways to stay close to your partner afterwards like cuddling making conversation or showering together by showing that you re invested you stand a chance of strengthening your connection and sparking something lasting and meaningful,let the intimacy of the moment fade gradually take a few minutes to just lie there with your partner and bask in the post coital glow the act of intercourse may be over but the blissful feeling of warmth and connectedness doesn t have to be all too often people will get up and leave or find something else to focus their attention on as soon as sex has ended depriving themselves of the small moments of pleasure that come once the immediate thrill has ended 1 x research source just like you use foreplay to ramp up the excitement and anticipation before sex you should build in some time to slowly and gently come back to earth afterwards it s important to take a few minutes to rest and recharge if you plan on going for a second round cuddle your partner rather than rolling over to claim your half of the bed hold your partner close cradle them in your arms and gently nuzzle their neck or stroke their hair chances are you ll drift off into a peaceful slumber together after a while providing the perfect end to your night 2 x research source if you re both still feeling energetic you can watch a little tv listen to music or talk and joke with one another while you re snuggled up physical affection is extremely important after sex without it your partner may get the wrong idea and think that you were just in it for your own pleasure 3 x research source enjoy the silence there s no rule that says you have to talk after sex forget about coming up with the perfect one liner and instead just listen to the sound of your partner s breath feel their heartbeat and try to take in as much of the experience as you can if you feel like you have to say something you ll just get caught up trying to say the right thing which can come off sounding forced and insincere let conversation unfold naturally when you do resume talking do it in an organic fashion relax be yourself and speak only when you have something worth saying complimenting your partner on their performance or asking something as simple as how they re feeling can be a good place to start 4 x research source try not to let your line of questioning come off like an interrogation you ll be putting them on the spot by asking things like did you like when i did this never critique rate or offer unsolicited advice post sex it s a time for feeling good not getting a lecture 5 x research source take a bath or shower together when the time comes to get up and wash off do it as a unit rather than in shifts a steamy shower may be just the thing you need to leave you feeling refreshed you could also climb into a bath and take a long relaxing soak if space allows not only will this save water it s also an opportunity to be playful and get more comfortable around each other 6 x research source bathing with someone for the first time can be a little awkward keep the mood fun by teasing them with some lighthearted splashing or offering to scrub their back for them get some space if you re feeling withdrawn sometimes people discover that they feel distant once the act of intimacy has ended especially if their partner is someone they don t know well this is perfectly normal if you re experiencing mixed emotions or the idea of sticking around to spoon a stranger makes you uneasy excuse yourself to do something else like call a trusted friend or take a long walk you can always go or ask your partner to leave if you re not feeling any better after a few minutes 7 x research source you re not obligated to cuddle flirt or carry on conversation after sex instead you should always do what makes you most comfortable while it s important for your partner to be able to relax and enjoying themselves once it s just as important to make sure that you re feeling alright about what s just happened 8 x research source try to stay awake it s perfectly natural to get a little sleepy right after you ve finished doing the deed but nodding off after a passionate lovemaking session could be misinterpreted as rude do your best to stay present and engaged it may help to sit up or get a thought provoking conversation started if you re especially drained 9 x research source when you feel like you re in danger of nodding off concentrate on taking full deep breaths or take a trip to the bathroom to get your blood pumping make it a goal to outlast your partner once they fall asleep you can take it as an all clear to begin snoozing yourself put down your phone make sure the other person knows they have your undivided attention until the lull of the moment has passed the last thing your partner wants after being intimate is to look over to find you with your eyes glued to a screen there will be plenty of time to respond to your texts or update your facebook status later 10 x research source it s also a good idea to silence or turn off your phone before sex to keep from being interrupted take your time getting dressed reach for your underwear if you re feeling exposed but leave the rest of your clothes where they are if you get chilly slide under the covers or pull your partner a little closer rather than making a beeline for your pants you ve already shared your bodies with one another so there s no need to suddenly become bashful there s no harm in changing into a pair of pajamas or sweats to get cozy but covering up in a hurry may send the message that you feel distant or ashamed consider staying the night assuming you don t have anything pressing to do in the morning going to bed with the person you just slept with can be a good thing for both of you hanging around is a respectful courteous move as it shows that you re not overly eager to get away from them you can go your separate ways the next day after spending a pleasant night together 11 x research source if it s not practical for you to stay find a tactful way to break the news that won t make it seem like you re looking for an escape tell your partner that you have to be at work early in the morning or that you have a pet at home that needs to be fed or taken out it s not always safe to assume that your partner wants you to hang around when you re at their place try to pick up on any signals they re putting out that hint that they might prefer to sleep alone like mentioning how busy their week is or withdrawing physically or emotionally after the act follow up with a call or text get in touch with your partner the next day and let them know that you enjoyed their company many people make the mistake of intentionally putting off communicating with the other person because they re afraid it will make them look needy but this just sews the seeds of doubt a quick exchange will show them that they ve been on your mind 12 x research source a phone call is the most personal way to go since it requires more effort than a text but a typed message is better than nothing if you re busy don t wait too long to reach out keep in mind that you re dealing with another person with their own feelings expectations and insecurities not playing a game remain warm and friendly in public say hi to your partner when you see them at school or the office or run into them while you re out and about smile make eye contact and give them a few minutes of your time a good rule of thumb is to treat them the way you would any of your other friends unless you ve already agreed to keep things between you quiet don t feel like you have to go incognito in order to play it cool or keep other people from finding out it s more likely that your partner will just think that you re dodging them at the same time don t do anything to call attention to the fact that you ve slept together discretion is an essential quality for maintaining healthy mature sexual relationships make an effort to spend time together outside of the bedroom if you ve got a couple hours to spare see if your partner would like to get together for dinner or go to the movies at the very least offer to go for a walk or meet up for a cup of coffee they ll be delighted to know that you re interested enough to want to see them again so soon 13 x research source the point is to get in some face time while you re fully clothed to maintain and strengthen your initial connection an unwillingness to participate in non sexual activities can make you look shallow and may result in the other person feeling used be up front about what you want communication is vital for any relationship even one between casual sexual partners during future correspondence let them know how you feel about things and encourage them to share their thoughts as well if one of you is looking for a long term relationship and the other is just content with hooking up occasionally you re both going to be in for a rude awakening 14 x research source ask yourself what you hope to gain from the relationship and where you see things going your partner deserve to be on the same page or at least have an idea of where you stand it s never alright to string someone along in the hopes that you ll continue receiving sex,Relationships

dance with a girl to attract her in a club and how to make out with a random girl to get your self started keep in mind that approach anxiety is not a personal problem and common as most people suffer from it if you made it a personal problem that s more ego and will add more to your anxiety what you resist persists zen saying realize that most people don t find cold approaching normal hence chances of success via cold approaching are low so you need to calibrate accordingly like doing indirect approaches rather than doing your spiel like a socially disconnected guy keeping a balance between meeting girls via cold approaching dating apps and social circles can be fruitful chances of success would be higher at a social circle event because there s a sense of familiarity however cold approaching has other deeper benefits like developing deep inner confidence a good sense of humor caring less what people think public speaking taking risks getting out of comfort zone making new friends dissolve anxiety etc also the potential of making a better connection with a person you met via cold approach is usually higher as compared to meeting a girl through a social connection or app its cause when you cold approach a girl you are already coming out as highly polarizing give some thoughts to logistics you are most likely not going to get laid if you didn t consider the logistics first this can come even more handy when you are going on a date as you can decide where to meet the girl so always plan logistics to your place or hers ask questions like where do you live who are you here with who do you live with are you working tomorrow etc these questions can be handy to plan and figure out logistics that would suit the hook up best when you are out on a date try not to be more than 15 20 minutes from your or her place it can work well if you are a walking distance from your or her place make sure you know how to take her to your place or hers take advantage of apps like uber or lyft or drive if you are sober you can also take public transportation as it gives you enough time to make a good connection here s a date idea take her on a train date to unfamiliar parts of your city the girl may be with her friends or may have obligations to them for example if she has only one friend with her then you can offer to pay for her taxi so you can get to be alone with the girl or ask your wing to indulge the friend so she he doesn t interfere you can also invite the friend to come to your place keep in mind that usually logistics will not be in your favor if she can t come with you you can try to pull her to your or her car or the bathroom or other private places you can also exchange numbers so you can plan to meet with her another day which may work best for many people have fun despite the rejections have fun or you will take rejections too seriously and eventually give up people who are having fun are not only attractive but don t take rejections or things seriously having fun is one of the most important practices to attract people so talk about things that are amusing or interesting to you make jokes be polarizing etc for example you can open to girl with something like you know coffee by the time it would reach giraffe stomach will be cold have you thought of that because you always think about yourself embrace or accept or become ok with rejections rejections are part of the process hence unavoidable so why not accept it or at least become ok with it infact if you learn to have fun with rejections they can be immensely amusing and help you be more non reactive which is not only attractive to most people but is also intelligent and peaceful you may not have heard this a lot but its fine to get rejected or fail failure lies concealed in every success and success in every failure eckhart tolle however don t make rejections a concept to shield your ego for example if you think something like lets go get rejected or let s go fail etc too much before every approach this implies there s a negative mindset behind and it will very likely become a self fulfilling prophecy keep a balance i want you but i don t need you to have fun or something like i am going out and i will have a good time regardless of the rejections developing this non needy and fun mindset when you go out will be quite yielding in the long run this usually comes with practice and experience again people who are having a good time are quite attractive be aware of your intentions as your actions and words come out of that it s

like if she says this i will do or say this can be too technical and gamey this is not going to lead you very far because you are trying to control the conversation and not having fun lead and let it play out means you lead the conversation by talking about things and activities that you both are passionate and enthusiastic about and then let it take its natural course read section 2 of get good at picking up girls for more details on this true mastery can be gained by letting things go their own way it can t be gained through interfering tao te ching bring her into a mutual bubble women like a guy who can lead so don t get pulled into her world and supplicate to her or you will most likely end up being her gay best friend plus its pretty unattractive because it sub communicates neediness so instead pull her into a mutual world and talk about things which you both are passionate about and find fun don t have this high expectation that whatever you say should be funny or interesting it

feel your vibes it is highly recommended to read get good at picking up girls for more depth listen be completely present then interesting and fun things will come spontaneously and naturally it means don t plan in your head what you are going to say next just be in the moment completely and truly listen to her listen with your whole body as the spiritual expression goes true listening is a great gift you can give to someone it also sub communicates that you don t want anything from the girl and are not treating an interaction as a means to an end but simply allowing this moment to be as it is which is a powerful practice plus listening and observing helps you pick up a lot of subtle hints and details about the girls which you can use to make inner jokes and recall personal details at right moments thus helping you to make a better connection by making them feel important that s why having sex is usually a by product of making a deep connection with a human being use us mentality and roleplay it can be effective if you do it right read section 2 of article get good at picking up girls for more on this keep it playful and sexual you need to make it sexual if you want to lead things to the bedroom for example talking about what kind to cereal she eats in the morning is not going to get you far unless you can make it interesting or flirtatious for instance you can say something like may be i will make breakfast for you someday or tomorrow morning if you feel that the girl woman is cool you can also be direct and say something like i just cannot keep my eyes off your nice breasts sexual conversations arouse girls women quite quickly as it helps them visualize how intimacy is going to be like with you it also sub communicates that you are not shy of talking sexually this helps women open up more keep a gentle but focused eye contact it s very important to make a good eye contact with people as it not only makes you look confident and sparks attraction but also helps you subconsciously convey your true intentions which are communicated far more than your words for example your eye contact with a girl you want to exclusively date would not be the same with the girl with whom you just want to have sex plus it s polarizing because if your gaze conveys your intentions well it can help you recognize the girls who are are not attracted to you or have the same intention as you escalate physically with a little dominance and persistence it is gold if you know how to escalate physically especially during the night as it is not only highly polarizing but also can turn a girl on pretty quickly in the beginning you can practice escalating progressively with common sense like touching her elbow or grab her hand or hug her to detect the level of receptivity from the girl if she s fine with it or doesn t quickly pull away or says no you can smooth your way to her shoulders or may be give her a little back and neck massage of course while having a normal fun and or sexual conversation although don t think she s not aware of your escalation usually girls are aware and allow the physical escalation to happen because they find it attractive and dominating or are fine with it again girls usually like a guy who can lead then you can wrap your arm around her shoulders and keep on massaging you can also slide your hand down to her waist and then with little calm assertiveness bring her body and face closer to yours in case she questions or pulls away you can say something like your body is so smooth and soft that i can t keep my hands off from you however if she s receptive go for the kiss or kiss her cheek if she turns her head being persistent with common sense helps a lot especially during physical escalation as girls even though they like it may deny you reluctantly because they may feel that other people are judging them so being persistent is important as it can help you maneuver through resistance the woman girl is offering be alert to see how the girl is resisting if its aggressive and quick then its a sign to not escalate further and the girl could be a no girl keep a balance don t physically escalate too much or too fast else she will most likely feel repelled and attraction may diminish this balance usually comes with experience and after some or many failed attempts depending upon your personality and learning curve you can also be sneaky like hey let me read your palm when she gives you her hand you can say something like i just wanted to hold your hand you can just go straight for the kiss if you feel that girl is receptive or just want to know the boundaries for your self it works best in the nighttime this is high risk high gain action and requires common sense and courage most girls who are not interested will just deny you read make out with a random girl for more on this shuffle or walk her to different locations when you shuffle with a girl to different places you will feel you have been to many places together which means you both will feel more comfortable with each other in less time this is classic as usually during business meetings businessmen shuffle their clients to different places like restaurants ice cream parlors showing them around etc this is to make their client more comfortable and build a rapport so try to shuffle her with you from one bar club place restaurant to another instead of just sitting or staying at one place you can use an excuse like we can go the xxxx bar as it has a great view of the city also shuffling helps you come up with various conversation topics due to the changing environment around you be persistent in showing your interest it s necessary not just important that you are persistent even though girls want to have sex with you or date you many have the same collective societal conditioning which may make them feel immoral unconsciously or consciously if they go home with you or show interest in you so you may have to wade through the puddle of societal conditioning by being persistent keeping it fun and subconsciously convey that you see her the same as you i e human being this comes naturally when you are touch with your inner space use common sense when she says no listen to her tone and watch her behavior if she means it back off there are plenty of other girls move on it helps a lot to sub communicate from the beginning itself that you are a non judgmental person like talking normally after kissing giving her warm hugs in between touching her holding her hand sliding her hair behind her ear making fun of the situation playful banter having a genuine and interesting conversation etc this helps a lot in the long run as it can help prevent things like excuses flakes last minutes resistance pushing you away etc to be truly non judgemental you need to dissolve the ego keep her on her toes if you sense the conversation is going dull do or say something to keep her on her toes for example spin her around find another common interest or conversation topic skip the small talk and go straight to deeper conversation lock your hands with her physical escalation bring your face closer to her shuffle her dance use sexual humor take her to dance etc read get good at picking up girls this is important especially during evening or nighttime and in high energy environments as there is so much going on so you would have to take the lead and make it interesting and fun or you will most likely to get blown off at the same time it doesn t mean to force it make sure you find it fun or intriguing first that s why its so important to have fun and talk about things that you find amusing and interesting how can you expect to keep the girl engaged when you are not having fun you should be the first person you need to entertain and if they feel entertained too that s what builds a connection also its extremely helpful to develop a good sense of humor yes it takes practice to be funny and come up with interesting and funny things to say or do so it helps a lot to watch stand up have interesting hobbies look at memes view funny videos etc read section 2 of get good at picking up girls for more on this dance guys who can dance are usually more attractive to girls than guys who don t search online to learn some moves or simply copy what other people are doing around you there are many girls who are out for the night just to dance so having the same mindset also helps a lot be honest though you re not out for the night just to dance if your actual intention is to pull a girl home also dancing with girls is a great opportunity to escalate physically which can turn her on pretty quickly without you having to say a lot of words this is the power of physical escalation give her an excuse to come go home or next location with you set up the scene don t make it forced in most cases you cannot just say let s go to your my place and have sex unless the girl is openly comfortable with the idea of having sex so you may have to give her excuses or go to buffer places to pull her home for example you can say something like let s go to that diner or lounge they have great fried rice or liquor or let s go to your place i will give you the best coconut oil massage you have ever had in your entire life let s go to my place and i will show you the aquarium or whatever it is we were talking about let s go to my place i will make you a cocktail which tastes like elixir etc even if you don t have anything interesting to show or cook you can still find a good reason to bring her back in most cases she won t even ask about it after getting to your place taking the girls women to buffer place like some restaurant or coffee place or lounge can help simmer down the energy and help you get to know them better and make a better connection if the girl still shows resistance like what if you turned out to be a killer or a rapist then try to flip the script with something like hold on what if you killed me and tossed my body in the alley now i am scared although you need to make a good connection with a girl to get to this point again keep in mind that pulling a girl home is not straightforward it s a dirty business and can be quite challenging however if you embrace or accept the challenges and roadblocks rather than resisting them it can be quite amusing and rewarding in the long run challenges drive you deeper take it easy many guys get too excited or anxious during this phase and become too defensive or start playing it safe remember it s a journey and not a means to an end remain patient and use the momentum you built before during the conversation with her for example when you are in a car or walking to your or her place touch her playfully or sexually talk dirty if that s your thing bite or kiss her neck or simply continue to have a normal fun and sexual conversation to maintain sexual tension and connection keep a balance if we had sex that s good if we didn t that s fine too this attitude helps a lot to keep you non needy and attract things and people in your life this is also keeping in alignment with the universal law that says abundance comes to those who already have it so when you are feeling non needy or having fun you are sending a message to the universe that you are abundant already which you are in the core of your being that s when things almost certainly come to you usually it takes practice and experience to develop this kind of attitude here are few practices that can help you develop this mindset approach and go on dates with less attractive girls from time to time this helps tremendously with things like gaining reference experience seeing people beyond their looks lowering your expectations be grateful for what you have however the best and quickest practice to become truly non needy is to deeply realize that no experience relationship thrill or possession can satisfy you except temporarily that s when things experiences and world lose their significance and importance that they don t have their transient nature is recognized more clearly that s when true peace and joy arise from the core of your being also it helps immensely to inhabit your inner body to be truly non needy as through inner body you are one with the peace and joy of universe keep the same flirtatious vibe going don t play it safe the moment you played it safe you are done she agreed to come home with the guy who was charming fun and confident when you met not some impatient and play safe person again be patient and don t make it as a means to an end talk to her the same way when you met her or at least be aware to detect yourself playing roles and safe as awareness helps to dissolve the role playing mental patterns read section 5 of get good at picking up girls for more keep your place ready the environment of your place plays a great role in setting the tone it is essential to prepare your place before a pull so clean and tidy up your place thoroughly you do not want to show her an untidy unclean and smelly place keep some alcohol at your place especially when you are coming home after a club or bar as you want to keep the mood going fix her a drink if she wants one keep the playlist ready create a playlist with music congruent to your personality but less energy and bpm it s like you are slowing down a car gradually not abruptly play the playlist when you get home you can also use your phone to play music if you are at her place take advantage of apps like pandora or spotify or youtube dance with her if that s your thing then dance with her slowly make her comfortable it helps to keep a few other things at your place to make the girl more comfortable like extra toothbrush candles baby wipes extra towel and pillows fluffy bedsheets chap stick water near the bed etc stop making excuses to avoid approaching girls a lot of guys have these excuses like she is not hot enough she is with her friends i don t feel like approaching she s not my type let me get a drink and then i will do it and other similar excuses most of these excuses are nonsense for instance if she can turn you on while she is naked in bed she is attractive in fact approaching and talking to less attractive girls not only helps you dissolve your approach anxiety but can also get you in a social mood a lot faster as chances of holding a conversation with them are high we talked about this earlier in addition it helps you maintain your social mood and see sameness of bearing before all human beings as eckhart tolle puts it give yourself value how can you expect girls to enjoy your company when you can t enjoy your own company when you give yourself value you naturally give other people value too and hence become more attractive here are a few practices to give your self value be comfortable in your own skin embrace or accept what you have good or bad as when you truly accept you naturally become less gamey more real honest and vulnerable thus you naturally come across more attractive to most smart girls take good care of yourself meditation following your passions physical workout healthy diet etc help a lot how can you expect to perform well in the playground when you are not physically and mentally sound believe in your core that you deserve a partner or get intimacy if that s what you want it s okay for any one over the legal age of consent to just want to get someone to go home with them having a partner is not for everyone confidence is key in attracting anyone and believing that you deserve it and are able to offer her a mutually pleasing good time is half the job entitlement allow the thoughts or self limiting beliefs that say you are not good enough or she is so out of my league i am not attractive enough she will reject me etc let them be this lack of entitlement will dissolve naturally if you just allow these thoughts to be and deeply realize that you are not thoughts if allowing the self limiting beliefs is not easy then replace these self pity and demotivating thoughts with affirmations or action for example when a negative thought comes like she s so out of my league or i am not feeling it then immediately replace them with affirmations like you deserve it or i am worthy lets talk to her etc this helps bring an inner shift and that s what is reflected in world around you as world is just a reflection of your inner state 2 x research source tolle eckhart i power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i

own life experiences in favor of a man s is often referred to as mansplaining it s considered unattractive and disrespectful 11 x research source don t be overly cheap most women will not expect you to spend indiscriminately but if you take a girl on her first date to your favorite fast food joint or ask her to pay half at a very expensive restaurant that you suggested she may think less of you for that think about it a date is a chance to show her that you think she s special and to treat her so if you act cheap you re communicating that you don t value her or your potential relationship with her 12 x research source avoid mentioning words like saving and budget for the first few dates plan your dates wisely you can pick restaurants that you know have a menu in a price range you can afford by looking them up online first or choosing to eat at lunch time instead of dinner you can also try making dates that might be cheaper overall like making a romantic picnic in the park or taking her out to a famous local destination for sightseeing instead of eating treat everyone around you well whether you re at work on a date or at school be careful that you treat everyone around you with a minimum level of respect this means don t pick fights yell insult people act egotistical and in general avoid copping an antagonistic attitude women are often watching how you treat other people around you and not just them to get a feel for how you might treat them later on or people they care about 13 x research source this includes people serving you like waitstaff or salespeople if you find yourself in a situation where you re getting upset because something didn t go right say you waited an hour for your food to come and when it did it was cold take a few deep and slow breaths before speaking in an even calm voice politely say i d like to speak to a manager when they arrive without blaming anyone explain the exact problem and why you are so upset before asking them to please do what they can to make it right don t be needy although everyone gets down in the dumps every once and awhile you should avoid being overly insecure and dependent particularly at the beginning stages of a relationship you want to show that you ve got things together and you re not a hot mess just waiting to fall apart on her 14 x research source don t talk a lot about previous relationships that didn t work out or express deep fears of failure on the first couple of dates until you have gotten to know each other better say after several months of steady dating this is often considered oversharing if you have overwhelming or chronic feelings of anxiety or sadness about your work friendships or current or past relationships during the time period before you can share but have no one else you can talk to about it seek counseling from a licensed therapist to help you work through your problems compliment her everybody likes to hear that they re liked and why someone finds them attractive it s a good way to boost her self esteem and make her feel special be sure that your compliments are specific instead of saying i think you re beautiful which she has probably heard before and is very vague try saying i like your freckles i think they re cute or i love your perfume it makes you smell so good compliments that take note of both her inner and outer qualities like that dress looks great on you it really brings out the color of your eyes are especially good this compliments not just her physical features but also her choice of dress and therefore her decision making abilities women want to be valued for their minds as well their physical bodies avoid comments that are sexual in nature until you are in a much more established relationship you should wait until after the second or third date at least many women will not be comfortable receiving overt sexual attention too early on and it s better to air on the side of caution than risk offending her show her you care although being told that someone cares is great women want to be shown that you care too although this can mean giving gifts this can also boil down to displays of affection kisses hugs hand holding and that sort of thing the whole point of dating someone is being with them and feeling close to them if you re too distant and emotionally unattached that s not good gifts do not have to be expensive although many girls do like candy and flowers something that you have taken the time to make yourself like a piece of art a poem a song or something you ve handcrafted like candles will also make her happy it s not the price tag on the gift but the thought that went into it that should matter share your feelings and talk regularly no one can know what s on your mind unless you say it so it s important that you communicate effectively once you ve gotten past your second or third date a girl is going to want to start to know what you re thinking and feeling how your day was the things that trouble you what made you happy how you re feeling etc talk about the things that matter to you like important projects or personal setbacks and don t be afraid to admit when something matters even if it feels like it should be too small to be noteworthy there is no hard and fast rule as to how much communication is too much or too little especially since each person s or couple s life circumstances may make this vary greatly if one of you owns your own business or is busy 12 hours of the day working then you may not be able to talk as much talk with her to find out how much you both agree is the right amount as long as you two are happy whether you talk or see each other every day or only once a week is fine 15 x research source listen to her relationships can t survive without good healthy communication and women want a man that is both capable of expressing himself and listening to her listening to someone is a sign that you respect them as a person and value their thoughts and experiences if you don t want to listen to the person you re with chances are that s not the right person for you practice good listening skills 16 x research source keep eye contact and face her when she s speaking stay relaxed but pay attention and refocus on the conversation if your attention starts to wander keep an open mind and don t be too quick to pass judgments don t interrupt her particularly not to give solutions wait until you re sure she s finished before you begin to speak cues in her speech pattern a long uninterrupted pause after a completed thought and tone of voice the ending high tilt for a question or a low tilt for a statement will let you know when you can speak ask questions when she pauses to clarify anything you don t understand and only give advice if it seems like she wants it try to understand her feelings and be empathic by giving good feedback like that really sucks or i m so happy for you depending on what you re being told basically try to be supportive even if you don t have any advice to give pay attention to any nonverbal cues particularly those being given through body language and facial expressions which will help you understand how she is feeling respect her boundaries there may be times when the girl you like expresses that she doesn t want to do something like talk about a sensitive subject ex a family member s mental illness or having sex it s very important that you respect her if she says no and don t try to force her to do something that she isn t ready to whether this is talking or acting this builds trust and most likely in time she will be ready to share with you whatever she s been holding back if you want her to realize that you want to be supportive or that you still want her to feel comfortable coming to you in the future try saying something like okay i understand and respect your feelings but if you ever change your mind just let me know i m here for you get involved in her hobbies being in a relationship means that a girl is looking for someone to spend time with especially if you don t have any interests that already overlap you should try to get to know what she likes to do and get involved too this could be anything from finding a similar band that you re both into to books that you like or playing video games girls have interests just as diverse as boys and she ll be touched that you care enough to find out what she likes and to try it out too don t assume that you know what she likes based on her looks or other women you know every person is different ask her what kinds of things she enjoys and pay attention when you have conversations or are hanging out likely she will mention things in conversations that she does like yoga or watching horror movies,Relationships

clothing and grooming habits if he knows that he is going to see you he may pay special attention to preparing his appearance notice if he seems to be dressed up or if he has styled his hair more

be aware that he may not say it back immediately this does not mean that your relationship is over he just may need some time to process the idea watch his body language when you tell him how you feel if he immediately seems physically uncomfortable he may not share the same feelings if he does not respond and seems to feel indifferent then he may not truly care about you talk about the future

how to know a girl s feelings,finding out a girl s feelings is a complicated matter that is even more complicated by the fact that her feelings can change and may not be consistent there are a multitude of indicators of feelings that are expressed in her eyes in her facial expressions and vocal inflections and in physical behaviors but understanding the context is necessary to understanding what they mean for example the initial looks that are given by a girl when they meet a guy are not likely to be real indicators of how she is feeling romantically toward him 1 x research source instead you have to look at nonverbal signals over time to be able to determine romantic interest the best way to find out her feelings for you is through watching patterns develop over time and asking her directly if she has feelings for you,pay attention to her gaze there are several things that eyes can tell you about the way she might feel romantically if her eyes seem to gravitate toward your face and eyes often during conversation and when you are not in conversation she may be interested in you romantically typically if a person is interested in someone else sexually than her gaze will shift to parts of his body that she finds attractive if a person is romantically interested in another person her gaze will stay more focused on their face and eyes of the other person 2 x research source be careful though her eye shifting patterns could be a sign that she is an extrovert extroverts tend to be much more stimulated by social interactions and make more eye contact than introverts notice the size of her pupils constricting eye pupils are another indicator or interest or desire if you notice that the black pupils of her eyes become smaller when she is looking at you it could indicate that she is interested in you romantically or sexually people s eyes will dilate when they are looking at something that they want 3 x research source this is particularly easy to spot in people with blue eyes because of the contrast between the darker black pupil and the lighter blue iris be careful people s pupils also constrict in response to increased light brightness so be aware of any lighting changes if you notice her pupils constrict count how many times she blinks in a minute if while you are talking she blinks more than 6 10 times in a minute that could indicate that she has feelings for you people who are looking at something or someone they like tend to blink more often than normal wear a watch with a second hand that you can easily watch while you are counting make sure that you two are interacting while you count 4 x research source listen to the tone of her voice if she is romantically interested in you her voice will probably get lower not higher and it will sound huskier and more breathy researchers theorize that there is a cultural stereotype that women who are interested in a man speak in a way that is more low and seductive 5 x research source there has been a misconception that women who are romantically interested in a man will make the tone of their voices higher and sweeter however if she is trying to send you signals that she likes you she is probably talking in a deeper and huskier tone look for groupings of gestures a group of gestures together could show that she feels connected to you for example if she is smiling she has her head titled to the side and she is holding or touching her face at the same time this could indicate possible romantic interest in you 6 x research source if she is extroverted she may be more expressive with her gestures and more likely to make these kinds displays with people whom she simply feels connected to watch her body language when she laughs although laughter itself is not an indicator of romantic interest what happens when she laughs could be when men are interested in someone they tend to take up more space and lean forward toward that person while they are laughing when women are interested they will position their bodies so that their positive physical traits are being highlighted while they are laughing women will sit up straighter or take on postures that make them more attractive or seductive 7 x research source don t assume too much too fast if you are interested in her your interest in her could hurt your ability to read her signals correctly anticipating signals of attraction from her will make your perceptions more unreliable so take your time and do not jump to conclusions too quickly take the span of a whole night or a few dates to gauge her feelings for you 8 x research source when you are observing her try to be objective and look at the situation how a person with an outside perspective might see it look at how she is acting with other people to check to see if you are assuming too much for example if she seems to be giving other people lots of eye contact and grouping her gestures often she may be an extrovert and you will need to take that into account when you read her body language notice signals that say she is not interested in you just like there is body language that shows interest there is also body language that shows disinterest or anxiety for example if she is raising her eyebrows often she might be uncomfortable and this could mean that she does not want you to like her 9 x research source additionally crossed legs and arms may mean that she is trying to stay closed off to you this could mean that she is anxious or resistant to your feelings 10 x research source you can ask her if she is worried about anything if she tells you that something is going on with her that is causing her worry her body language may not be in response to you also her feelings for you could be causing her anxiety if she likes you and does not know how you feel this anxiety could be coming across in her body language if you notice conflicting signals of interest and than disinterest you may want to talk to her about her feelings ask her to do an activity where you can concentrate on her set up an activity like going out to dinner or going to a coffee shop for the purpose of talking make sure there is plenty of time for you to sit across from her and talk about things the best way to understand a person s feelings is to have a conversation with them where you are looking at them and actively listening 11 x research source men generally feel more intimacy from doing side by side activities like watching sports or drinking but doing side by side activities makes it is harder to read how a person else is feeling because you are not facing the person and actively listening during these activities listen actively to what she says to you sit face to face and when she is talking lean forward a little and maintain eye contact with her this will allow you to understand her feelings because you will get access to all of the signals that she sends through their voice inflections facial expressions and body language the more information that you get the easier it is to understand how she is feeling 12 x research source use your body language and these conversational techniques to improve your listening skills 13 x research source show through your body posture that you are listening this will encourage her to speak and you will be able to understand her more the more she communicates nod your head to show your agreement or to encourage her to keep talking give her the right amount of distance this will also encourage her to communicate with you because if you give her the right distance she will be more comfortable talking to you if you stand too close you may come off as overly interested while standing too far away will make you seem aloof give her space to talk but position yourself so that you can hear and see her well restate the main idea of what she is saying this will help you know that you are understanding her feelings correctly and she will be able to correct you if you have the wrong idea of what is going on with her if she is talking about her frustrating day for example you can say so you are saying that you didn t understand why your sister was acting up until you saw what was going on with her at school be empathetic to her feelings if you can start to exercise this muscle in your interactions with her you will become more adept at picking up on how she is feeling empathy means you can understand the feeling that she experienced even if you do not share a common feeling for example you can combine restating her main idea and being empathetic by saying you must have felt so eager to get out of the house after sitting in a desk all day ask her how she feels about you or a situation where you are worried about her feelings often the best way to find out how someone feels is to ask them directly this will take the guesswork out of your interactions and can free you from overthinking the situation you should listen the most to what a person says even if you think it contradicts what their body language says find a place where you aren t distracted by other people or activities this doesn t have to be a long conversation look for a quiet table or a couple of chairs where you can sit for a couple of minutes and talk about how she feels ask her if she would mind talking to you for a minute you don t want the situation to put too much pressure on her so tell her it will be short you don t need a lot of time to ask her how she is feeling say hey do you mind talking for a minute think about what you want to know specifically before you talk to her phrase your question in your mind before you ask it if you seem confused or ambiguous when you ask her the question she may not be able to understand how to answer your question and she may give you an answer that doesn t help you first think about how you feel for example i am starting to develop romantic feelings for you and then consider what you want to know i want to find out how you feel about me romantically make sure you are specific for example do you feel romantically for me is a better question than do you like me because like could mean many different things to different people and is too ambiguous she may not want to hurt your feelings and might avoid telling you how she feels directly unless you ask her directly ask her directly how she feels and tell her how you feel for example you can say i have been really enjoying our time together and have developed romantic feelings for you do you feel romantically about me respect her feelings and do not feel bad about how she feels recognize that you are brave for asking and if you respect her feelings then you can only feel good about your actions remember that your self worth and identity are not in how she feels about you even though you may care very much,Relationships

that are self serving to you if she s really stressed and you offer her a massage and she says no find a different way to show your appreciation for her like asking what she needs show her you respect her this is a huge part of flattery and of making sure that flattery doesn t get really creepy make sure that you respect her boundaries and her as a person if you aren t respectful you re flattery will come off as creepy for example if you say something nice about her appearance and she doesn t respond well let it go don t badmouth her simply because she didn t respond to your flattery remember just because you ve said something nice or done something nice does not mean that she owes you anything,Relationships

to talk reach out to your friend and let them know that you have something to tell them and that you want to meet up to talk assure them that it s nothing at all to worry about just an idea that you want to share with them to see how they feel meet in a quiet place that you both enjoy like a park or a coffee shop if you are very nervous about meeting you can also have this conversation over the phone it will be less pressure on both parties if over the phone still feels like too much pressure consider writing a letter to your friend expressing your thoughts be honest and heartfelt this is

their friend but you can t help but feel something more for them 4 x research source you might begin by saying something like we have been friends for a while and i have loved every minute of it i ve

don t like me back well i won t exactly be happy but i ll understand i just couldn t keep this to myself any longer without seeing if you feel the same listen after you have expressed yourself to your friend being as honest and open as possible take some time to listen to their response listen to them without waiting to respond but simply to understand though this is an exciting time and you will likely be very nervous try to focus as much as possible you might want to say something like well i ve done quite a bit of talking and i d like to know what you think now please be honest with me answer any questions that they might have they might ask you the moment you knew you felt something more so take some time to think about that beforehand give them some time to think you may have shocked them with your words or they may have known it was coming either way it is a lot of information to take in and you need to respect them enough to give them the time to process their feelings tell them that you don t need an answer right away unless they are prepared to give you one on the spot 5 x research source if they feel the same way as you then that s great if not that will be okay too and life will go on start slow don t jump into being in a relationship right away this typically is unsuccessful in creating a long lasting and meaningful partnership instead take your time to get

start going out more alone if the two of you typically see each other in groups or with mutual friends start setting aside time to be alone together more relationships can often deepen and develop when fostered apart from others don t abandon your friends for your newfound relationship however still spend time with them just take time to also spend alone with your new sweetheart go out on a date the more things progress the time will come for the two of you to go on a proper date set aside some time to go out to dinner with one another or to a movie dates really set a tone of romance in a relationship and will further move you two away from friendship and into love there are also other options for dates like a picnic in the park or going horseback riding don t rush being physical

cute that you can do for them send flowers or write a love letter buy them a small but thoughtful gift enjoy your newfound love if they are your friend you likely already loved them before your relationship changed however the space you are now entering into is new and exciting and significantly different from your platonic friendship enjoy this new love and go forth and be

from her or always around if she gets in touch with you you should respond but don t get back to her the second she calls or texts or she ll think you re obsessing over her just play it cool you don t have to avoid her 100 of the time but you should cut back on visiting your favorite hangouts or hanging out with mutual friends in hopes of seeing her think of this as your time to regroup before you win her over again reflect on what went wrong every relationship is different and so is the end of your relationship if you want to win your woman back then you have to consider whatever it was that ended things and to make sure not to go down that path again were you too controlling too distant or were there some general incompatibility issues maybe it was more simple you couldn t get along with her friends or she couldn t understand your love for motorcycles whatever it was it s time to dig deep to find the source of the problem 2 x research source make a list of all of the things that went wrong in the relationship then look at the biggest issues that led to your downfall you and your ex may have openly discussed these issues before you broke up or maybe you thought your relationship ended for one reason when it was really completely something else once you ve pinpointed the main problem or main problems make sure that it s something that you can really control for example if your main problem was your fundamentally different religious beliefs or the fact that you live across the country from each other and can t relocate that may be hard to fix make a game plan for addressing the problem before you can make a move and start talking to your ex again you have to think of a way to address the problem once you ve figured out what it was you can think about all the things you can do to fix it if it s relatively simple then great but be aware that some problems take a long time to fix if the problem was your lack of confidence then you ll need some time to work on developing a positive sense of self if the problem was your jealousy then you have to work on being more trusting and less paranoid if the problem was a quality of your ex then you have to think about how to be okay with that quality or about how you can work together to both change work on yourself everyone can use some self improvemnt and what better time to do it than when you have to win your

your ex complained about as well as the things you d like to fix see how many of them you can address or try to focus on the aspect that matters the most to you if your ex complained that you were messy then spend more time cleaning your space if your ex complained that you were flaky or always late then work on sticking to your commitments and showing up on time when you make plans with your friends and family enjoy your own company you shouldn t spend all of your me time obsessing over improving yourself or wondering what your ex is up to instead enjoy your own company by reading

secure by yourself before you try to jump back into a relationship again 3 x research source if you re busy pursuing your own interests your ex may see you doing it whether you re going for a run or reading your favorite book in a coffee shop if she sees you doing your own thing she ll be impressed doing your own thing will also make you a more interesting person when you reconnect with your ex you ll have more to talk about let her see you having a good time if you want your ex to want you again then she has to see you eventually after enough time has passed a few weeks at least it s time to get back into her social circle or just to run into her at a time when she can see what a great time you re having if she knows you re sitting at home pining for her she ll be less likely to want to be with you than if she sees you having a great time tossing your hair back and laughing loudly with your buddies go to the places where you know she ll be without being too obvious about it when you see her stop and chat to let her know you care but don t drop everything to go talk to her instead have a great time with your friends and make her want to join in on the fun whatever you re doing just make sure you have a big smile on your face and that you re laughing or just clearly having a great time without thinking of her if you know you ll see her you should try to look a little nicer without making it too obvious that you made an extra effort get in her friends good graces maybe one of the reasons that your relationship ended is that her friends didn t think you made an effort to get to know them or that they thought you didn t care enough about your ex to make the relationship worth it so if you want your girl to want you again winning her friends over can help you pave the path to her heart here s what you can do 4 x research source if you see her friends make an effort to be incredibly nice without suffocating them just let them see what a great guy you are and move on

the first move start talking to her more asking how she s doing and taking a real interest in her life and thoughts let her know that she s on your mind and that you really do care about her without overwhelming her whether you just run into her at the campus bookstore or even invite her out for coffee slowly find a way to make it back into her life whether you re talking to her over the phone or in person suggest that you should hang out again keep it very casual when you do meet up don t be obvious about your romantic feelings just make her miss you without telling her how you feel play hard to get if you really want to win your ex back over again then you have to play hard to get once you get back into her life sure you ve had coffee maybe seen a movie or have even gone back to texting each other or chatting on the phone every few days but that doesn t mean you should be completely available to her you have to find the balance between making her think that you re at her beck and call if you re out in a big group let her see you talking to other girls just enough to make her a little bit jealous just don t overdo it you don t want her to think that you ve completely moved on if she asks you to hang out don t agree to hang out as soon as she s free make it seem like you have a busy schedule and that you have to squeeze her in if you are hanging out check your phone and send out a text once or twice make her wonder who else you re talking to show how you ve changed once you start spending some time with your former flame again you need to let her see that you re a changed man don t do the same old things that used to drive her crazy you can even laugh and point out how much better you are now if you want to make light of things if she always complained about how messy your car was clean it up and say not bad right the next time she needs a ride do whatever you can to make her see that you re working on improving the qualities that caused troubles for the relationship are slowly improving just remember not to change completely remember the things she must have loved about you and highlight those aspects of yourself when you re together make sure she s interested before you tell her how you feel you need to know that your plan to win your woman over is really working you need to be able to read the signs to see that your ex doesn t just want to hang out with you as a friend but that she shares romantic feelings for you to do this you ll have to pay attention to what she does says and to study her body language to know that you re on the same page 5 x research source check out her body language when you re together does she make eye contact occasionally look at the floor when she s feeling shy and lean her body towards you when you speak if so then she may want to get closer to you see if she gives you compliments on how you ve changed or just points out your good qualities consistently if so then she may want to start dating again see if she s hanging out with other guys or if you ve heard she s interested in someone else or if she only seems to hang out with you see if she goes out of her way to see you if she mentions hanging out in the future and if her eyes light up when you ask when you can see her again tell her how you feel if you really do think that she does want to be with you again then it s time to share your feelings with her find a time to get her alone whether you ve asked her out on a date or are hanging out in a more casual but private setting and turn to her and tell her how much you ve missed hanging out with her and that you wish you could be a couple again let her see that you ve put a lot of thought into it tell her that you re aware of what went wrong and talk about how you re determined not to let it happen again tell her you ve spent a lot of time reflecting and working on how to become a better person make her see that you ve already started to make an effort to be with her again start dating again if your old flame does respond to your advances and wants to start dating again too then it s time to celebrate but not too much remember to take things slow to be a gentleman and to ease back into the relationship enjoy dating telling each other how you feel and kissing and cuddling and take the time to reflect on how much you mean to each other instead of rushing right back into where you started remember to take it slow don t start hanging out with her 24 7 but start going on dates or hanging out a few times a week you don t want to make her feel smothered at the beginning of your new relationship just because you re dating again doesn t mean you should take her for granted take the time to compliment her make her feel special and let her know how lucky you feel to be hanging out with her again get a fresh start don t look at your time with your woman as the reiteration of your previous relationship instead think about it as starting over and starting to enjoy spending time with each as if it s the first time though you can definitely talk about the good times you shared in your previous relationship you shouldn t dwell on the past or rehash old arguments work on building a solid and new foundation to your newfound relationship and take it from there if you spend all of your time obsessing over the past you won t be able to enjoy the present with your woman again though you can go back to doing the things you loved together you should also take pleasure in pursuing new interests checking out new restaurants and going on trips to new places together don t fall back into old habits though you should enjoy your relationship as a new one you should still remember the thing that led to the downfall of your relationship if you find yourself fighting again disappointing your girlfriend for the same reasons or finding yourself feeling the same negative emotions you felt the first time around remember to check yourself and to work on overcoming those troubling situations find a way to get out of those same bad feelings if you re feeling irrationally jealous again tell yourself that you re more likely to lose your girlfriend if you keep feeling that way don t overthink it it s important to avoid falling back into old habits but don t spend all of your time obsessing about making the same mistakes again either find a balance between enjoying your new and hopefully improved relationship and being wary of repeating the same mistakes if you spend all of your time worrying about all of the things that can go wrong whether it s in a new relationship or during your second go around you ll quickly sabotage your chance at happiness focus on living in the moment while learning to catch yourself if you re falling back into your old bad habits your girlfriend and you can work together she ll take part in keeping the relationship feeling new while avoiding negative patterns you shouldn t be the only one who wants to make it work again always be yourself though it s important to make the changes that are necessary for improving yourself as well as your relationship don t go so far as to change yourself completely so that you or your girlfriend don t even recognize the person you ve become your girlfriend must have liked many things about you to be in the relationship in the first place so don t forget to maintain the positive qualities that made you a great guy in the first place if you try to change yourself too much then your girlfriend will be able to tell she should already know you pretty well and will know when you re not being yourself it s okay to address your flaws as long as you re also emphasizing your positive attributes,Relationships

how to recognize the potential crazy girlfriend,you ve heard the horror stories about awful ex girlfriends maybe you ve even got a couple of horror stories of your own the following will show you how to recognize these women and save you from heartbreak broken belongings and bad memories,be very cautious if she has violent tendencies she should never hit kick push etc her date or anyone else nor should she be breaking things on purpose 1 x research source some people will play fight such as if she grew up wrestling her brother or trying to push him onto a couch however this play isn t meant to cause harm and both parties consent to it some people kick someone under the table or play slap them if they say something rude however these shouldn t cause real pain and shouldn t be upsetting to the recipient if she breaks things when upset notice 1 whose things she breaks and 2 who cleans up if she s truly losing control her things are just likely to be broken as yours and if she s remorseful she ll clean it up herself but if she only breaks your things and then has you clean it up it s a power play abusers are often very good at hiding their true selves so they might not give any obvious signs until you re in it deep even then they ll keep you questioning it this is the nature of the abuser and it s not your fault for not seeing it listen to see if she refers to other people as crazy my insane boss my psycho ex my crazy mother it s highly unlikely that everyone this woman associates with is irrational the problem is most likely her calling other people crazy is a red flag in general it s dismissive and shows that the person may not think highly of people who don t act like the person wants note patterns of unpredictability if she often switches jobs friend groups or living situations then there s likely an underlying problem sometimes the problem isn t with her personality for example her awful parents kicked her out of the house at a young age and she had trouble finding a place to live for a while other times the problem is her a long history of making enemies often means trouble consider how she talks about her past some people have decent pasts and some people have hard ones if she s gone through a lot of hardship she may be hesitant to open up to you because it s painful and difficult but if she s acting secretive or shifty it may be that she has something to hide 2 x research source there s a difference between hiding genuine pain because she s not ready to share and hiding secrets because she knows you wouldn t like what she s done are her motives honest or manipulative notice how much she builds herself up some women are more confident than others and it s normal if she jokingly compliments herself such as if you say you re pretty and she says i know and gives you a flirty smile but constantly building herself up could mean that she has self centered tendencies or serious self esteem issues that hamper her ability to have a real relationship notice the difference between joking bragging and excessive bragging consider how quickly she tries to get close to you it s okay for a girl to be forward if she likes you however if she tries to integrate herself too quickly into your life without letting you have a say in it then she may be obsessive do you feel overwhelmed by how much she tries to contact you does she try to get involved in every aspect of your life friends family etc a secure woman will feel comfortable letting you have some time to yourself because she trusts you ll always come back to her if you feel pressured tell her that you want to take it slowly say you d be more comfortable that way if she listens then she s excited but clearly respectful of you if she refuses to accept your boundaries then it may be time to break it off beware lying a good girlfriend is honest even if she think you might not like what she has to say she shouldn t be hiding things constantly dodging questions or keeping big secrets sometimes people will tell white lies like yes i like your tie this is ordinary and not a big deal as you two become close she should be open about exes if they come up and whether she s seeing them at all in her life don t expect her to share everything with you she doesn t need to tell you what she ate for breakfast or the precise details of her time with friends a good relationship has a healthy balance of truth telling saying the things that are important and leaving out minor details that don t matter notice how she talks about her past relationships a mature person will admit she s not perfect and that past breakups may have been partially her fault she usually won t talk extremely negatively about her exes unless they were truly awful or if she s still caught up in her feelings 3 x research source if she badmouths her past dates she may talk the same way about you later consider if she conflates facts and feelings or calls names i felt really pressured and uncomfortable so i broke it off is different from my ex girlfriend was an obsessive stalker like creep a mature woman might say things like we were a bad match or he wanted so much space i didn t feel like his girlfriend anymore acknowledging two perspectives she may have had a few experiences that were completely the other person s fault e g an abusive ex but depending on the circumstances she won t always place 100 of the blame on the other person recognize that some disabilities or mental illnesses can cause unusual behavior not all differences mean that your girlfriend is undateable some people have issues outside their control as long as she never makes you feel unsafe then she ll be a good girlfriend as long as you enjoy spending time with her a girlfriend with an anxiety disorder might get very worried sometimes need reassurance and hyperventilate over things that feel small or overblown to you such as thinking you ll leave her even though there s no way you would a girlfriend with bipolar disorder may have mood swings she can t control 4 x research source an autistic girlfriend might be sensitive act eccentric at times and have awful crying episodes when she gets overwhelmed she just needs to cry it out and rest and then she ll be back to normal think about her perspective how does she see things what does she need understanding her side of the story can help you relate to her and figure out how to make the both of you happy if you don t know why she s doing something tell her i don t understand why you ____ could you explain your point of view to me in rare cases her perspective might be something to understand but not honor you don t have to give up your boundaries or tolerate abuse for example if her goal is to insult you and make you feel that only she will love you that is terrible and wrong consider how you might be able to handle the situation better many times relationship problems are two sided instead of fighting with her try to work together with her to make both of you satisfied for example if she wants more time with her friends and you are worried about drifting apart perhaps you two decide that she has a girl s night on friday and then comes back to watch a movie snuggle and relax with you this could start a tradition that you both enjoy or if she wants to talk on the phone for a long time but you have a deadline you could tell her that you have 15 minutes devote those minutes completely to her and then tell her you ll be able to talk more tomorrow try clear communication it may be that your girlfriend has different expectations than you do or doesn t realize how you feel about her behavior use i language to express how you feel for example i feel overwhelmed when you send a lot of texts in a short period of time if you just send me one i ll text back as soon as i m able or i felt hurt when you teased me about my haircut a good girlfriend will listen to i statements and try to avoid upsetting you again work out boundaries both of you deserve to be able to have alone time have a social life outside of dating and reveal very personal details only when you are ready neither one should be pushing the other if you feel pressured say so ask that she give you a little space when you re elsewhere and trust that you ll come back ready to devote time to her similarly let her have her own privacy and time alone or with friends you don t need to know every detail of her life this is important in showing that you trust her consider your expectations and feelings you should stay in a relationship because you enjoy it and because you feel that the hard times are worth it if you feel like it isn t working you re allowed to break it off don t stay in order to fix a girl s issues that s not your job and she s the one who needs to take the initiative you can be supportive if she wants to change but you can t change her make a clean break if you break up with her some people have a hard time taking no for an answer and if your girlfriend is one of them expect her to be very difficult to deal with 5 x research source don t invite her over if she leaves lots of messages give one message asking her to stop contacting you then block her if she continues tell your family and friends that you are broken up and don t want to see her anymore ask your mutual friends not to talk about it with you explain that you don t want them to take sides you just want to move on leave a toxic relationship some people are toxic and you should get out as safely as you can if possible if your girlfriend ignores your boundaries follows you belittles you or hurts you it doesn t have to be hitting then you have a very serious problem no one deserves to be treated this way 6 x research source get advice from supportive loved ones ask a counselor or trained expert for advice if your girlfriend scares you don t go back to her she may draw you back in even if it seems nice or she says she s changed change takes time and the will to change and it s likely it ll be just the same 7 x research source,Relationships

girlfriend depends largely on the girl and the connection you have with her fortunately the simple act of being there for her when she needs your support and understanding goes a long way toward comforting her,be there emotionally and physically as quickly as possible within reason you should make your girlfriend your number one priority when she s upset and needs your support how quickly you re there for her might be as important as being there itself and the act of you rushing to her aid lets her know how much she means to you this alone will help her feel better regardless of why she s upset obviously you won t be able to rush to your girlfriend at the drop of a coin most times you will have to balance the criticality of your current activities and the severity of her emotional distress if you re at work or school and her situation is dire you should clear your mind of your responsibilities and give her all the emotional support and caring that you can verbally let her know that she is your number one priority and that you will be there physically as soon as you can practically clear your plate listen carefully to what she s upset about until you know what your girlfriend is specifically upset about you can t offer any but the broadest consolation whether the situation is minor or a life changing issue any consolation necessarily starts with listening intently to what she s saying and any positive comforting begins with empathetic understanding by the listener 1 x research source act as a mirror for her emotional frustration the best thing you can do is to become an active listener and let her work through her feelings and come naturally to her own realization insight resist injecting your solution into the process instead facilitate her settling into her own understanding of her emotional quandary let her vent while you assume the role of empathizer 2 x research source engage in active listening make a habit of rephrasing what she s said to you 3 x research source make her feelings and articulations be your entire world for the time she talks to you empathy cannot happen if you re partly focused on your own thoughts even so you shouldn t be afraid to offer your own feelings but only if she asks you for them make her laugh laughter helps relieve the stress and re centers the emotions in this way a number of mental and emotional problems can seem less critical and more manageable 4 x research source if you and your girlfriend have a strong enough chemistry you are probably making her laugh on a regular basis as it is humour is a powerful remedy against mental stress and it can help get her find off of what s bothering her long enough to affect positive change in her mood lighten any potential feelings of

case you should pull her in close to you and remind her feelings are normal and only to be expected reassure her that her trust in you will never ever be betrayed stay calm remember that the focus should be entirely on your girlfriend and her feelings while you are offering comfort and support this might be difficult if you re emotionally involved in the situation which upset her but you must put your feelings on the back burner and let hers be fully worked out if you get overly upset and start folding in your thoughts and feelings it will only make matters worse and in the end you will have done little to comfort or console her if you re upset it s best to make her feel better then tend to your side of the issue at a future time approach her on her terms when you meet with her it s important not to overstep your bounds this includes keeping a cap on physical affection or romantic gestures unless you think she s in the mood for it in many cases a girl who is furious over something isn t going to be receptive to cuddling when you meet her come close but respect her personal space at the start if she wants something chances are she will let you know depending on how long you have been with your girlfriend you should be able to predict her behaviour in certain situations if you ve comforted her in the past and she was receptive to certain actions repeating them again is a good trick use attentive body language while you re talking to her the best thing you can do initially is to let her know she has your complete attention although you ll be getting this

direction smiling and nodding your head when appropriate all will show the girl that you care 6 x research source buy her a gift gift giving is surprisingly well suited for times of stress although a

whatever gift you re getting her flowers are suitable for just about any situation but getting her favourite video game after her parents have died probably isn t going to get the reaction you re looking for offer a tissue if she s crying a tissue is a common offering to give someone if you find her crying crying can be an embarrassing thing even in the midst of someone you re deeply involved with a tissue doesn t make it any less embarrassing but it does help clear up the evidence offering your girlfriend a tissue to wipe away tears is especially helpful if she wears any eye makeup she

how to cheer up your boyfriend,cheering up your boyfriend can be pretty hard especially if you feel like you ve tried everything and can t even get him to smile though there are a variety of fun things you can plan and words you can use to make him feel better at the end of the day the most important thing is that you re there for your boyfriend and that you show him how much you care,spend some time with friends if you think it will help if your boyfriend is the type of guy who just wants to be alone or to be with you when he s upset then you probably shouldn t drag him out to a party or invite your fifty best friends over but if he s the kind of guy who gets his energy from other people and who is always laughing and feels engaged when other people are around then setting up a low pressure social outing can actually make him feel better try to make the event alcohol free as much as you can even if drinking will temporarily make your boyfriend forget his problems it will end up making him feel worse alcohol is a depressant after all 1 x research source if you and your boyfriend do end up hanging out with friends when he s upset be sensitive to his needs if he wants to go home early you should be respectful of that play a board game who says you re too old for monopoly or clue pick a game you both used to love when you were kids or one that you still play sometimes and spend a night together or with another two or three friends playing board games and having a fun simple night make some popcorn or bring out a few snacks like cheez its or fruit roll ups that remind you of your childhoods and make a fun night of it 2 x research source this will work best if your boyfriend isn t really competitive when it comes to games you don t want to end up making him more upset because he keeps losing property in monopoly you can even go to target or another store together and tell him to pick out any game he wants this may seem corny but it could cheer him up for sure do something he s always wanted to do think about it is there something your boyfriend has always wanted to do or try whether it s to check out the new deep dish pizza place in town or to watch twin peaks as long as it s fairly simple and doesn t require a lot of emotional energy you can surprise him with how thoughtful you are by setting up an evening to do something that he s always wanted to do of course don t push it you don t want to make a reservation at an expensive restaurant he s been wanting to try when he s just not feeling it but if there s a simple or low pressure activity you two can do together then you should try it get him out of the house if your boyfriend needs to be cheered up over something that isn t super serious then one of the best things you can do is to get him out of the house just being around people breathing some fresh air and letting the sun hit his face can have a big impact on his mood and can make him feel less alone if he s been sitting in a dark room sulking all day then of course he s going to be upset but if you make him come out even if it s just to take a quick walk it can have a big impact on his mood 3 x research source it may help to give him a short goal instead of just saying you want to go outside telling him you want to walk to get some coffee or to run a quick errand can make the trip outside have more of a purpose if you re both doing something inside you can easily do outside such as reading then try to get him to do the same thing in a park so it doesn t feel like he s exerting too much effort be active together get your boyfriend out of the house to go hiking running walking or to throw around a frisbee or to kick around another soccer ball it doesn t really matter what you do but it does matter that you get your boyfriend s endorphins going and that you help him get out and about a bit more even hitting up the gym together for half an hour can have a major impact on his mood if he s bummed out but not so upset that he can t leave the house then making time for some exercise together can help cheer him up when your boyfriend is upset he s much more likely to stay in one place to eat unhealthy foods and to pay less attention to his body being active together can help get him out of that rut of course if he seems really weak and tired than he may not be up for much more than a walk and you shouldn t try to force him to be too physical be affectionate but only if that s what he wants sex or any form of intimacy may not always make your boyfriend feel better and he may even feel worse if you act like the only way you can make him feel better is to get intimate still giving him more affection can definitely cheer him up if you go about it the right way hug him give him a kiss and put your arms around him to make him feel less alone squeeze his hand put a hand on his shoulder run your fingers through his hair or do whatever you know will make him feel better 4 x research source if your boyfriend is really sad and wants some distance then you shouldn t force affection pay close attention to how he responds to your touch if he responds positively and moves closer to you then give him more of your loving but if he seems to back away then take it easy on the physical affection for now make him his favorite treat another way to cheer your boyfriend up is to surprise him with his favorite treat this could be as simple as picking up food from his favorite thai place baking him brownies or presenting him with an ice cream sundae or even inviting him over to make him his favorite pasta dish this will not only make his taste buds feel better but it will show him how much you love and care about him if he s alone at home coming over with his favorite treat can also make him feel extra cheered up of course if he s seriously depressed then he may not want to eat much but if he s just upset over a bad test grade or something that won t last then this can be the best remedy have a picnic take your boyfriend out to the park a nearby grassy location or even your backyard and have a nice and simple picnic with him make him his favorite sandwiches bring along some treats he likes and prepare some soda sparkling water or another beverage of his choice you don t have to make it too elaborate as long as he sees you ve made an effort to make him feel better this can make for the perfect mid day surprise when you know he s feeling bummed 5 x research source you don t need to try extra hard to make it feel romantic it s more important that it s fun and lighthearted and that he genuinely enjoys himself bring some comic books sports magazines or something else he might like to make the picnic even more fun or to cheer him up if he doesn t feel like talking watch his favorite old school movie invite your boyfriend over make some popcorn and get some other movie theatre treats like snow caps or m ms and have him pick his favorite movie from his childhood to watch this could be the goonies a rocky movie the sandlot or really anything he used to love as a kid and hasn t seen in a long time it doesn t matter how silly it is or if he worries it may not stand the test of time this will make watching it even more fun making a cozy home theatre for him can be a better option than taking him out to the movies if he doesn t feel like going on a big outing or being around too many people understand when he just wants some space of course if your boyfriend is upset it makes sense that you want to do everything in your power to cheer him up and make him feel better however sometimes the best thing you can do is just to be understanding and to give him some alone time knowing that he ll feel better soon you don t want to force him to do too many things or to put pressure on him to be in a good mood or that may actually make him feel worse though you may think that your boyfriend can only feel better if he s around you he may actually feel worse because he ll feel like you re trying so hard to cheer him up and he just can t do it he may just want some time alone to sort out his feelings and you have to be okay with that another possibility is that your boyfriend wants your company but he doesn t want to do too much if that s the case and he s really too upset to do much more than eat or talk to you then you shouldn t try to force him to do more talk to him about it if your boyfriend is upset then the best thing you can do is to have a conversation with him about his feelings this can help him feel better by getting his feelings out there and having someone who cares about him understand what he s going through you don t have to put the pressure on and make him talk too much in a high pressure setting but you should casually let him see that you re there if he wants to talk this will help cheer him up and will help him deal with his emotions 6 x expert source connell barrett dating coach expert interview 24 september 2019 of course if he gets

doesn t want to talk though talking to him and hearing what his problems are can make him feel better sometimes he may be feeling so overwhelmed or so sad that he can barely get a word out if this is the case then don t force him to talk about it ask him a million questions or try to reassure him over and over again maybe he s not ready to talk about what s happened or maybe he s just grumpy about something minor and it will only make him feel worse to rehash it whatever the case may be you should look out for signs that he really doesn t want to talk and be understanding of that of course if

how to avoid being played,no one wants to be played by a player it can only end in humiliation and heartbreak luckily players are pretty easy to avoid once you know which telltale signs to look out for then you can just focus your attention on the good guys,players pretend to catch feelings quickly they will call every night text all day and perhaps even fall asleep on the phone with you at night as flattered as you might be know that it is all a trap his goal is for you to get used to it by doing the above he is getting that routine stored into your brain so that the next week when he stops talking to you you re already head over heels for him if you want to keep a player around you you need to take your time when he tries to fall asleep on the phone while still talking to you and events similar to that do not let it happen one way to make this work is to avoid allowing the phone conversation to last over an hour 1 x research source how does it work it was a routine of yours you are so used to talking to him all night but he suddenly isn t talking to you as a result you ll begin to miss him that s when you hit him up and then he knows he has you wrapped around his finger players love to give nicknames most of the time he will give you a nickname to make situations cute and along those lines however he is giving you a nickname to make you feel more of a connection to them some guys are quick to call you babe honey bunches or cutie pie if you catch that in the player you ve got watch out and be warned players can be sweet talkers and smooth with their words players love to ask you about your sex life although guys may be naturally curious about it the number of guys you ve slept with isn t essential to building a good genuine relationship players love to spoil you with compliments babe you are so beautiful may be one of them even if you felt so ugly that day there will always be this one guy saying oh you look beautiful or you look great for no reason as flattered as you may feel remember that they are complimenting you to make you feel good about yourself when a girl feels good about herself their confidence level goes up and she ll be willing to do anything to get that confidence even higher also guys are aware that girls love compliments 2 x research source players will start to talk about their lives they might say something similar to i ve been hurt in the past they are opening up and making you feel that you have a closer connection to them it is all for sympathy points they will burst out with emotions and will talk about how they have been played before how they have been hurt really badly before and that they know how you feel chances are they have been heartbroken before but that heartbreak is what lead them to become a player a lot of the times players pull the line i m a changed man i have had my share of playing games but those days are done i just want to meet someone that can keep me on track girls start feeling sympathy for them and they want to be there for them naturally when a girl sees a guy is heartbroken girls like to comfort them and give them a shoulder to lean on the more they want to be there for the players the more girls get to know them however the more they get attached the harder it is for them to pull out players love to pull the line i would treat you better than that i would never do you wrong a lot of the times girls are vulnerable when girls see that a guy is understanding they begin to think that this guy will be the one and that they will not break their hearts just because the guy claims that he will treat her better doesn t necessarily mean he will keep that promise in the future players will not want to be seen in public or have a public relationship one example is on facebook players will not want to be seen in public with you not because they are shy or they are scared or their friends will make fun of them but because he might run into one of his other girls he is talking to when your back is turned the player will not want to change his relationship status on facebook or talk about you on facebook a lot of the times they claim they are not ready or they just do not want to be seen in public with you the truth is they do not want to make it seem like they have anything to do with you because that shuts down their market of getting other girls there is a 50 percent chance that he really is not ready for a relationship but there is a 50 percent chance that he just does not want to be tied down if any guy really likes you he would want to have that tie with you so that no one else can claim you 3 x research source,Relationships

down and talking though that s important try fitting each other in while you re doing other things such as working out together or even grocery shopping together check in daily another way to show your partner that you care is to check in daily whether you re living together or not for instance text them at work just to tell the person you re thinking about them call them at night to see how their day went or if you live together make sure you take time to check in with them in the evening 2 x research source in other words make time in each day to connect with your partner you don t need to send twenty texts a day though if you both are up for that that s a good way to connect establish what works for both of you that is if one person isn t big on texting maybe email would work better

verbal give your partner a card or surprise him or her with a small gift just to show them you re thinking about them and how special they are to you for instance surprise them with a home cooked meal just to say thank you be empathetic empathy means actually trying to feel what the other person is feeling it takes an act of vulnerability to step into another s shoes however when you re in a relationship you have to be able to feel what your partner s feeling to create a sense of intimacy and not necessarily of the sexual kind 5 x research source one way to start building empathy is to be conscientious of checking in with your partner about feelings ask the person how he or she is feeling in a given situation it also means you have to stop only seeing through your eyes sometimes you have to shut off how you re seeing the world for a moment to understand how your partner is seeing it you don t have to give up your point of view you just have to change to your partner s perspective once in a while to understand the world through his or her eyes that may mean that you need to shut off the voices in your head as your partner is talking about a situation you may find yourself raising objections or trying to convince your partner to see it differently instead you need to shut those objections down and truly listen to what your partner is saying give as much as you take the best relationships function well because both partners give equally to the relationship of course at times you re going to be giving more and at other times your partner is going to be giving more however in the end it should even out so your both giving to the relationship 6 x research source for instance you may need to work more hours while your partner is in school and then he or she works more hours while you finish a degree this step is also important in the smaller things that is if you live together both of you should contributing to household chores and errands not just one of you skip the arrogance arrogance can drive a wedge between you in a relationship you re supposed to be equal partners so when your ego seeps in it unbalances it humility on both sides keep relationships in check 7 x research source a little competition every now and then never hurts however when you start thinking you re a better person than your partner overall that leads to an unhealthy relationship that doesn t mean you can t accept a compliment from your partner if your partner tells you you re great at something saying thank you is appropriate however telling your partner in a serious tone that she s terrible at something and you do it better isn t appropriate it only serves to drive a wedge between you two encourage your partner in a relationship it s important to be supportive of each other s interests if you re trying to be a better girlfriend it s important to support your boyfriend or girlfriend in what they do and encourage them 8 x research source for instance one kind of support is not ragging on them when they want to spend time away from you to develop an interest another way to encourage the person is to be their cheerleader when something good happens make sure to celebrate it with them be respectful relationships are built on kindness and respect when trying to be a better girlfriend you can show respect in a number of ways from listening well to being fully present when you are with the person 9 x research source for instance give the person your full attention when you go on a date don t be looking at your phone or watching the television that s on in the restaurant another way to show respect is to be sensitive to any cultural issues your partner may have for instance if your partner mentions that his or her family likes to do something a certain way don t just laugh it off because you like to do it differently another way to be respectful is to be forgiving rather than blaming when your partner makes a mistake offer forgiveness to him or her rather than tearing them down for it 10 x research source be kind small acts of kindness make the day to day life with your boyfriend or girlfriend worth living on your side being a better girlfriend means being intentionally kind to your partner 11 x research source kindness can show up in so many ways it can mean being considerate of needed alone time it can mean showing up with a cup of coffee when you know your partner needs it it can also mean something as simple as holding their hand when they re feeling a little anxious kindness can also be doing a chore your partner hates like running to the dry cleaners before she has a chance to it s all the small things that add up to show you care for the person give your partner space to talk we all have times we need to vent or to talk about something that s bugging us when you re in a relationship you become each other s place to discuss what s going in your lives however you have to make sure you create the space for that both time wise and emotionally 12 x research source in other words if you always cut your partner off when they start talking about something that s bothering them that s not creating the emotional space for them to talk in addition you have to open the door sometimes when you notice your partner is looking down or sad try to ask them what s going on listen without being defensive listening is an art you ve got to really pay attention to what the other person is saying not just trying to figure out how to respond when you re in a serious discussion for example you may have a tendency to get defensive based on just a few things your partner says without really hearing them out trying to truly understand what their trying to say rather than getting defensive can lead to better communication 13 x research source as they re talking take in what they re saying open up to what s underneath the words not just what they re saying aloud 14 x research source show them you re listening by asking leading questions you can also offer short summaries for instance you could say what i hear you saying is your upset because i m not spending enough time with you that helps them know you re listening plus it helps you to know you are getting it right 15 x research source hear verbal cues a cue is when your girlfriend or boyfriend casually mentions something that they are interested in in turn you take that cue and respond appropriately sometimes by asking about the interest sometimes by taking action 16 x research source for example say your girlfriend says something like isn t that car adorable my car is getting so run down you could say oh are you considering get a new car or you could ask her if she wants to go test drive one another example is if your boyfriend mentions a new restaurant going in down the street that looks good you could take the initiative and make reservations picking up on verbal cues shows you are listening and paying attention watch your partner s body language a person s body language can tell you as much about the person as what the person is actually saying the body reveals underlying thoughts and feelings so paying attention can help you put together what your partner is actually saying 17 x research source for instance if the person turns away from you while you re talking it could mean they ve lost interested or they re trying to hide something 18 x research source if they re not looking at you it could indicate they re hiding something or that they re having trouble getting out what they want to say it can also be a sign of embarrassment 19 x research source if they cross they re arms it could mean they re starting to get defensive about the conversation 20 x research source try to keep discussions positive that doesn t mean you can t discuss problems what it does mean is you try to keep your language positive and the way you hold the discussion positive when you start out a discussion in a positive light it has less of a chance of escalating it also means your partner is more likely to listen and hear you just as you re more likely to listen and hear your partner if he or she isn t yelling at you or being angry 21 x research source in other words try not to have arguments when you re very angry as they can just escalate into nastiness humor can keep discussions light as can affection gestures such as hugging or lightly touching the person s hand or shoulder 22 x research source wait until you ve calmed down sometimes when you re really angry you want to discuss the problem right then however that means the conversation is going to be overly charged with emotion and you probably won t get anywhere except into a fight it s okay to wait until you ve calmed down to have a discussion 23 x research source a 2 day rule is a good bet that is you should bring it up within two days if you still feel strongly about it if not drop it 24 x research source if you must deal with the issue today try taking an hour break go spend some time doing something you enjoy such as listening to music or reading a book once you ve distracted yourself for a while you ll be better able to deal with the situation deal with issues when they re small if you let small things go too often sometimes they can snowball into something bigger deal with issues as they arise and you re less likely to blow up at your partner 25 x research source for instance if you hate it when your boyfriend doesn t call at night bring it up if you let it keep happening it can grow into this huge thing that comes between you and him and then you ll explode on him you could say hey i know your busy at night but i feel upset when i don t hear from you i like to know your safe know what your needs are in a relationship you have to take care of yourself as well as your partner in fact sometimes you need to take care of your own needs first so that you can be supportive of your partner 26 x research source that means of course that you must know what your needs are maybe you need alone time once in awhile or maybe you need cuddly time at least once a week once you know what you need express those needs to your partner have a conversation about what both of you need both in and out of the relationship try to make a plan about how both of your needs can be met for instance you could say i really need cuddle time once a week your partner might counter with i m happy to give you cuddle time i love cuddling with you but i also need to spend a bit of time apart as well pay attention to the signs of emotional abuse just because your partner is saying you need to be a better girlfriend doesn t mean you are being a bad one in other words you need to look for signs of emotional abuse in your relationship you can find yourself in a emotionally abusive relationship without even realizing it 27 x research source for instance some signs of an emotionally abusive relationship can be that your partner is hypercritical of you humiliates you shuts you out completely and or gets very angry and moody much of the time 28 x research source other signs can be

how to date an otaku girl,you might be nervous about approaching an otaku girl with romantic intentions regardless of whether you re an otaku or non otaku guy dating a girl who falls under this category isn t any more difficult than dating any other girl though all you really need to do is find the girl and appeal to her interests well enough for her to take notice of you,check the stereotypes at the door the trouble with any label is that it tends to reduce people to nothing more than stereotypes and hollow shells before you approach an otaku girl remind yourself that she is an individual person with her own quirks beliefs and personality some of her characteristics might scream typical otaku but many won t the same thing can be said about impressing her once you ve already met and started to date there is no single set of steps that can be used on every girl who falls under the otaku label including the steps listed in this article use the label as a starting point but always personalize your approach based on the specific girl log on otaku girls can often be found online in chat rooms forums and various social media websites moreover these girls are often comfortable interacting in the digital realm and can appreciate an online meeting just as well as an offline one navigate forums related to anime manga or other aspects of otaku culture join active groups on facebook or other social media websites about those topics as well and participate in the discussions that go on as much as possible when you find an interesting girl start following her on her blog or on one or two social media websites don t follow all of her accounts at once though since doing so may come on too strong and scare her away 1 x research source venture into the real world not every otaku girl is glued to her computer monitor of course the vast majority have lives in the real world and if you want a more traditional meeting your best bet is to track down the otaku girl in her natural habitat in other words go someplace related to her interests since she d be likely to visit there in her free time for example try going to a store that has a wide selection of anime or manga spend time at an arcade see a movie that has a large female fandom or if you re feeling especially daring try going to an anime convention approach her with a good opening line once you find a girl who piques your interest you need to make a good first impression you don t necessarily need a flashy witty pick up line though striking up an interesting conversation might be more than enough discussions about shows movies and related media tend to be a good place to start especially if you see her looking at a similar series in a store 2 x research source if you don t know enough about her likely interests you could even start the conversation by confessing your lack of knowledge and asking her to make a recommendation know her passions in the united states the term otaku is usually reserved for people who are hardcore anime or manga fans but in japan otaku basically defines anyone who is a hardcore fan of any one interest even if the otaku girl in your life is a huge anime fan it helps to know which series and genres she s most interested in the japanese concept of otaku is similar to the american idea of a fangirl or fanboy geek or nerd a person could be an anime otaku or game otaku but someone could also be something like a train otaku anyone who loves something enough to obsess over it can be labeled as an otaku the american concept of otaku tends to be someone who is obsessed with some part of japanese pop culture or asian pop culture in general anime manga and computer games are the most notable obsessions but an otaku could also obsess over j pop music or korean dramas do your research simply knowing the title of her favorite series isn t enough if you really want to impress your otaku girl you should do a little research into her favorites so that you know what they re all about you don t need to love everything she loves but you should have a basic enough understanding to follow along with her rants when she starts talking about one of her passions another advantage to your research is that you ll learn more about the type of things she loves rather than knowing only a few examples most otaku girls will branch out from their original obsessions and latch onto things related to them 3 x research source if you learn enough about what interests her you may eventually be able to introduce her to something else she d enjoy which will definitely leave her feeling impressed with you impress her by acknowledging those interests take her to places that cater to her passions give her gifts that are related to the things she loves otaku girls like to be romanced but standard cookie cutter actions only scratch the surface and fail to address her as an individual keep in mind that your gifts do not need to be expensive to make an impression as a general rule otaku girls tend to enjoy inexpensive merchandise related to their favorite series and characters just as well as expensive merchandise something as simple as a totoro plush toy might be enough to charm a girl who loves studio ghibli characters if traditional romance is your style you can stick with it but try putting a twist on things take her out for dinner and a movie but pick an anime movie for an anime otaku similarly you can buy her jewelry but look for jewelry connected to one of her favorite franchises do not look down on her or expect her to change some otaku girls might be a little embarrassed by their interests but most don t see any shame in it either way you need to show her that you don t feel embarrassed by her interests cutting her down for loving the things she loves is a quick way to make her push you away many otaku girls even enjoy the fact that their interests are somewhat obscure after all an obscure interest is unique and people generally like to feel as though they re one of a kind compliment her an otaku girl is still a girl after all so you ll need to pamper her with occasional sweet talk make your compliments honest and try to be a little creative as with everything a compliment that addresses her as a unique individual is better than something stereotypical like most women she ll want to be complimented on her appearance sometimes instead of saying something general you re really pretty compliment something specific like a certain feature i love the color of your eyes or a specific accessory your glasses perfectly frame your gorgeous eyes you should also compliment her personality as well as her appearance remark on her intelligence her cheerfulness her generosity or any other positive feature notice her other quirks more specifically know what sort of things bother her the otaku girl is a very passionate person overall most of her passion is directed at things she loves but she can be equally passionate about things she hates once you know what she hates do your best to avoid it for example if she s picky about grammar and spelling you probably shouldn t send her texts like wanna hang out c u l8r instead take the time to spell things out and double check your messages for errors don t push her too far out of her comfort zone while some otaku girls can be quite extroverted most tend to be somewhat introverted she may not be shy per se but she may not enjoy large crowds or similar settings as much as you do relationships require both parties to make compromises but if you want to work your way into her heart know when to take her out and when to let her stay in for those girls who are extroverted also keep in mind that certain settings may still make her uncomfortable she might like socializing with close groups of friends but that doesn t necessarily mean she ll enjoy going to a packed club full of strangers give her space for her hobbies there are times when the otaku girl might want to enjoy her hobbies on her own or with friends who pursue them just as vigorously as she does let her do this wanting to be with her as she does what she enjoys is a good thing but forcing yourself will only make both you and her more miserable when she s out enjoying the things she loves take time to enjoy your own interests visit friends have some alone time or go to an event you know your otaku girlfriend would never enjoy if you feel the need to be constantly connected to her ask yourself why you might be feeling neglected or jealous figure out what the issue is and talk it over with her before it gnaws away at the foundation of your relationship make a trade 4 x research source when you re trying to impress the otaku girl you might focus on activities that appeal strictly to her interests once the two of you enter into a more serious relationship though you ll need to find balance between the two of you one of the best ways to do this is to make trades in return for doing something she loves this time the two of you will do something you love next time when you do spend time doing what she loves try to be genuinely interested in it if she wants you to watch a favorite movie pay attention to it instead of staring at your phone if she drags you along to a convention try to find something about the convention that you can be interested in as well you can also let her instruct you on her hobbies for instance if she happens to love a certain game let her teach you the best way to play it trust her some of the friends who share your otaku girlfriend s interests might be guys but typically you won t need to worry about her turning her romantic attentions toward them once the two of you are already in a relationship remember that the otaku girl is fiercely passionate about the things she loves if she loves you she s not likely to drop you so easily when you show that you trust her it may also make it easier for her to trust you by demonstrating that you are dedicated and secure in your relationship you ll show that she has no reason to doubt your affections drop your guard as the two of you get more serious you need to demonstrate that you are comfortable around her since many otaku girls have introverted personalities they ll find it oppressive if they feel like they always have to be on for you make yourself comfortable around her so that she ll be more comfortable around you in return dropping your guard should be done in moderation though you don t need to show up at her door in polo shirt and khakis but on the other hand you don t want to wear the same stained t shirt four days in a row either be casual but take care of your appearance and exhibit respectful behavior be more than just a boyfriend in spite of her love of two dimensional characters you ll need to be deeper than that instead of being the perfect charmer you need to be her friend become someone who she can turn to for acceptance and comfort if you want the relationship to last,Relationships

public healthcare system of the uk go to source go to the gym 3 x research source get your hair done some may say that they really don t want anyone who judges them by their looks however appearance is what attracts a potential mate to you be it male or female it doesn t hurt to increase your odds especially as the odds are against us in this age range boost your self esteem if you don t believe in yourself how can anyone else and if having self esteem is not your forte then try being positive if you smile and try to be an optimist others will be attracted to you as you make them feel good feel free to give out compliments 4 x research source others will return the favor and you should see your own self esteem skyrocket as well 5 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source go where the opposite sex hang out in your age range for example if you are female the chances of you finding a man over 40 when you go out with your daughter to a baby supply store are slim to nil whereas the chances of you meeting a male over forty increase considerably when you go with your son to a sporting goods store to buy him a hunting rifle the same can be said of where you choose to eat out for lunch a better option would be a pub instead of a french restaurant it would be useful to think what interests men that is where i will find them the same goes for men over forty seeking women don t expect to find many quality women over forty at the local bar though it can happen it is unlikely your best bet would be again to think of what interests most women in their forties have for example some enjoy book clubs others enjoy shopping at department stores it would be in your best interest to find something compatible with your own interests if you ve always wanted to try scuba diving and notice the sign up sheet has many female names listed this might be the time to try that hobby check out the internet online dating is another option of course no matter how attractive you look at forty it won t do you any good unless you leave your house to date when using online dating services it s important to put safety first just as you would in any dating situation after this choose a site that best meets what you want in a potential mate 6 x research source while a site that caters to rednecks might not fit your style neither so might a sugar daddy site check the site out before you even put your photo up for inspection it would be a good idea to check out the profiles of the opposite sex on the site does this site meet with your idea of dating do people seem to quick to sleep together or do they seem to fast to marry choose a site that meets your comfort level you may have to pay a monthly fee to get the quality of site that interests you get to know people talk a lot don t give out personal information but do get to know the likes hobbies interests and other determiners of compatibility when you do feel comfortable meeting again follow the safety rules and meet in a public place it would be wise not to sleep with your date at the first meeting if you would like to continue the relationship what your mother told you is usually true respect comes with time and time spent online does not count in this instance don t rush the process just as there is no reason to sleep with the opposite sex on the first date there is also no reason to push or be clingy as well know that this relationship might work out for the two of you but know also that at the initial stages it could go either way keep your options open to other potential mates until both of you feel that you are ready to move into a monogamous relationship your best bet would be to call but not too frequently or for too long at this stage of the game texting seems too intrusive at this stage of the game you may want to hold off on this until in a committed relationship wanting to know where your date is every minute of the day can push them away from you instead of closer until you are ready to commit move forward if it works out great if not try not to repeat the same mistakes you made if any at all if you spoke too much of your deceased grandmother for instance during a dinner date you may want to speak of a less morose topic with your next prospect also potential partners will usually tell you if they are interested in finding the one having another child or merging finances if none of this is for you your best bet is to move on as quickly as possible to say you want something that you don t really is just wasting not only your time but that of your date if you have children the first date or first many dates is not the time to introduce them it is wise to wait until you feel that the relationship could move into something committed your children even grown ones may not like your new partner or vice versa you want to make certain that you have a good foundation laid before you introduce their opinions on the one in which you have fallen in love don t get discouraged if you can t find the one right away there is no time limit on dating many in their 80 s find romance and love it seems the less you stress about finding the one the easier it will likely become for you if it s meant to be it will happen regardless of your chances of being struck by lightning enjoy 7 x trustworthy source

how to relate to an autistic boyfriend,autism known clinically as autism spectrum disorder or asd is also sometimes referred to as asperger syndrome or pdd nos it affects people in different ways some autistic people face extra challenges in romantic relationships while others eschew them altogether if you are in a relationship with an autistic person you may be wondering how to deal with some of the things you have encountered then you can begin looking for ways to improve your communication with your boyfriend such as by anticipating social challenges accepting repetitive behaviors staying calm when you are upset and listening when your boyfriend wants to talk,learn more about autism by educating yourself about the condition and the challenges it may pose to your partner you will have a better understanding of what he is dealing with on a daily basis this knowledge may help you to be more patient learn better ways to communicate with him and even improve your relationship read general definitions of autism focus on books and articles written by autistic people since they have firsthand experience on what it is like to live as an autistic person be careful of your sources some autism groups that claim to speak for autistic people actually work hard to silence them 1 x trustworthy source austistic self advocacy network nonprofit organization run by and for individuals on the autism spectrum that empowers autistic people through education and public advocacy go to source be aware of his communication challenges autistic people often struggle to communicate in the same ways that non autistic people do some forms of expression may be too nuanced and difficult for them to understand and respond to this may lead to misunderstandings and problems within a relationship to avoid these problems try to be as direct as possible when you speak to your boyfriend 2 x research source for example imagine you say something like gina texted me earlier today you may expect him to ask you about what but your boyfriend might not understand that you are trying to have a conversation since you are not asking him a question instead it might be better to ask him do you want to know what gina said when she texted me today or just tell him what she said every autistic person is different expect to learn and adjust over time as you get to know more about your boyfriend anticipate social challenges social situations that are fun or easy for you might be stressful and difficult for your boyfriend the loudness and crowding of some social situations might cause your boyfriend to feel anxious and have a hard time concentrating on what people are saying your boyfriend might also have a hard time making introductions or small talk try writing a letter to your boyfriend about what his role is in social gatherings use direct language and only discuss one issue at a time for example you might write a letter focusing on why you want him to attend parties with you work together on making social situations more comfortable for him perhaps he d be able to handle parties if he could slip away to take a break every half hour or so or if you set a time at which you d leave early so he d know he wouldn t have to handle it for much longer discuss physical challenges some autistic people do not like to be touched or know when it is appropriate to give physical affection therefore your boyfriend may not know when you want him to hug you or he may not like it when you touch him without warning discuss these things with him to make it easier for you to have a better physical connection for example after something upsetting has happened you could say to your boyfriend i m feeling really upset right now could you please give me a hug it would help me to feel better accept repetitive behavior some autistic people may have certain routines that help them to feel better if these routines are disrupted they may feel anxious and get upset try to be understanding about any routines that your boyfriend has that help him to feel more comfortable do what you can to avoid disrupting those routines for example if your boyfriend goes for a run every day at 7 00pm be respectful of this time and do not try to prevent him from doing his normal routine stimming such as flapping hands or watching lights is another common autism symptom assume that these actions are important even if you don t understand why he does them ask your boyfriend about his needs every autistic person is different your boyfriend might have some very specific challenges that other autistic people do not have try asking some questions to better understand his challenges and preferences this will help you to be more considerate of his needs for example you could say something like i want to know more about things that you struggle with so that i can be more considerate what would you say are the challenges that you have because of your autism be sure to ask about his personal boundaries regarding touch for example does it bother him to be hugged do you need to tell him before you are going to hug him be aware of comorbid disabilities autistic people may have anxiety depression and other mental illnesses disabled people particularly people who have trouble with communication and emotional processing including many autistic individuals are more at risk for sexual abuse by care givers of many different job roles 3 x research source 4 x research source or others 5 x research source 6 x research source and this may lead to post traumatic stress disorder be sensitive and supportive about any challenges your boyfriend faces if he was abused he may not want to share the details with you the best way you can help is by respecting his desire not to disclose the details and by gently offering that he see a doctor but not pushing him if he is very stressed ditch the stereotypes there are many stereotypes about autism like that autistic people are incapable of love or emotions but these are not true autistic people have many emotions just like neurotypicals do they simply express them differently 7 x research source be an advocate for autistic people by pointing out incorrect assumptions about the condition when you encounter them try starting by saying something like i know that ___ is a well known stereotype about autistic people but the truth is current research has even shown that autistic people may have deeper or more intense emotional capacities than non autistic people 8 x research source be prepared for honest answers sometimes people who care about each other will tell little white lies or sugar coat the truth out of consideration for their partner s feelings autistic people may not do this instead you might get some very honest answers from your boyfriend these answers are not meant to be hurtful it is just how your boyfriend communicates 9 x research source for example if you ask your boyfriend do i look good in this yellow top you might expect or want him to say yes but autistic people might respond with no if they do not think that you do therefore you may want to avoid asking questions that you think might result in an answer that will upset you remember that honesty is your boyfriend s way of trying to help you answer his questions since some autistic people struggle to understand sarcasm or other non literal forms of communication you may have situations where your boyfriend asks you a lot of questions don t get upset if this happens remember he asks questions because he cares about you and wants to understand you 10 x research source say how you feel remember that body language and other non verbal cues may be difficult for autistic people to understand instead of trying to communicate with your boyfriend using non verbal cues say how you are feeling or what you are thinking by stating your feelings or thoughts instead of trying to get your boyfriend to guess at them you may avoid an uncomfortable situation or even an argument for example when a non autistic person like you avoids eye contact it is often a sign of being disinterested or upset but for an autistic person avoiding eye contact is normal and often not a sign of anything 11 x research source it helps to say i m really stressed today or i had a bad day by extension if he fails to make eye contact with you do not take it as a sign that he s disinterested in you unless he tells you so if he is doing something that bothers you tell him dropping hints or being silent and then snapping at him won t help be straightforward so he can understand and make a change for example please don t chew with your mouth open the sound really bothers me let your boyfriend know how you would like him to respond some autistic people are not sure how to respond to certain situations but you can help your boyfriend understand what you need and expect of him by telling him how you d like him to respond in those situations for example imagine that you get annoyed when you tell your boyfriend about your day at work and he tries to advise you on what to do just tell him something like i appreciate that you want to help me but i really just need you to listen when i tell you about my day be open to initiating more autistic people can have trouble initiating things or may not know what to do and whether it s appropriate you can make this easier by initiating the things you d like to happen whether it s flirting or kissing in addition to struggling with social situations some autistic people lack a drive or an understanding of sexuality or sexual connotations therefore he might say or do something that has a sexual implication or double entendre that he was totally unaware of for example he might ask you over to a sleepover with him having completely innocent non sexual intentions not understanding that this would be taken as a sexual proposition by most girls in this case explain to him that connotations and feelings of intimacy and sexuality go on in a bedroom atmosphere at night between people of the opposite sex and that social sleepovers are typically reserved for younger participants or groups of the same sex it could potentially happen that by his avoiding eye contact with you in conversation because of his autistic nature he appears to be staring at your breasts or another sensitive part of your body don t freak out or assume that he s being creepy simply tell him i don t feel comfortable when you look in that direction and direct his gaze to your eyes or somewhere else if you ever do want to get intimate or sexual with him be sure that he has a complete understanding of what sexuality is what it s about and the nature of what he s consenting to if he consents to the activity talk to him before discussing his autism with others some autistic people are fairly open about their disability while others prefer if only a few people know talk with him about how he feels about his diagnosis and whom he is okay with you telling handle disagreements as calmly as possible discuss your feelings and thoughts with your boyfriend in a calm straightforward manner although you may be entitled to feeling angry or hurt a calm straightforward approach may be much more effective than an emotional reaction becoming emotional may leave your partner feeling confused about why you are upset avoid making you statements such as you never you are not you need to etc instead make i statements such as i feel i think i want etc this is a general helpful approach that works for all people not just autistic people listen to your boyfriend in order to understand your boyfriend s perspective it is important to listen and make your boyfriend feel heard make sure that you take the time to stop and listen to your boyfriend when he is speaking do not talk while he is speaking just listen try to understand what he is saying before you respond 12 x research source validate your boyfriend s feelings validating the other person s feelings or concerns means acknowledging them and not minimizing them even if you feel like your boyfriend s perspective is flawed you need to accept what he has said in order to keep the lines of communication open in your relationship 13 x research source seek to understand first then respond if you don t know why he feels a certain way ask and listen closely to his response for example instead of responding with something like there is no reason to be angry about what happened last night try saying something like i hear that you are angry about what happened last night support his self esteem autistic people often struggle with low self esteem as they may be told that they are burdens because of their autism or associated unusual behaviors offer him plenty of support and reassurance especially on his bad days encourage him to get help if he exhibits signs of depression or suicidal thoughts accept him for who he is autism is a part of your boyfriend s experiences personality and life this won t change love him unconditionally autism and all,Relationships

you want to meet at a certain time if you want to meet up at 10 pm say did you do the math homework yet i m having trouble with problem number 10 consider asking your boyfriend to make fake social media profiles this way if your parents check out your web history they won t see his true name or photo it may help if he creates an entirely new online identity if not ask him to abbreviate his name on facebook or use his middle name in place of his last name so that he at least somewhat hides his identity delete your messages if your parents check your phone or computer often delete your messages in 5 10 minute intervals don t only delete conversations between you and your significant other but between you and everyone if you don t have many conversations it won t be as suspicious if your parents ask why you re deleting conversations just say that you re trying to conserve memory tell them that you have a lot of photos apps or music and you re trying to free up space by deleting unnecessary chat records got a message that you really want to keep screenshot it and back it up elsewhere a computer a flash drive or even a private album of pictures on facebook be careful about when and where you meet if possible meet where you won t be recognized you don t want your parents your relatives community leaders or your parents friends to see you while you re out with your boyfriend meet when your parents think you re somewhere else you could pretend to have a club meeting or to be hanging out with a friend you might even sneak out of the house at night if you live in a city you could meet almost anywhere a big city park a free museum a scenic hill or a little cafe in your favorite neighborhood the same goes for the suburbs although it might be harder to get around if you and your boyfriend don t have your own cars if you live in a rural area you might need to meet up outdoors don t hang out with your boyfriend in the park across the street from your house or the local supermarket or anywhere that your parents or their friends might run into you consider going out in groups when you go out with your boyfriend your parents will probably want to know where you are it may be best to bring a friend or two with you when you go out that way when they call you you can just say oh i m with amy and then put amy on the phone with them to verify that indeed you are with her and not your boyfriend say you re sleeping over at a friend s house this is a classic move but you ll need to be very careful about your story to pull off the basic idea if you want to meet up with your boyfriend after hours or even stay over at his house tell your parents that you are sleeping over at a friend s house if your parents insist on meeting your friends then you should use a good friend who your parents have met to corroborate your story tell your friend about your plan if possible if you are completely certain that you can trust your friend s parents have your friend s parents agree to pretend that you re sleeping over it helps if you name a friend whose house you ve slept over at many times before if your parents are suspicious they might call your friend s parents to check out your story consider whether this is likely to happen if so then you may not want to risk it be very careful about inviting your boyfriend over to your house understand the risks if you bring your boyfriend into your parents space then you are giving them a huge opportunity to find out about him wait for a time when they aren t home a whole weekend is even better if you sneak your boyfriend into your house while your parents are home make sure that he has a secret way to enter and escape try to bring him in once your parents are asleep and be extremely quiet so that they don t suspect anything keep the noise level down so you can listen for your parents voices or footsteps in case they re walking toward your room be prepared to hide him under the bed or in a closet at a moment s notice or have him leave through the window if possible don t leave any evidence that your boyfriend was there your parents will get suspicious if they see a men s comb or a men s jacket if he gives you a gift a note a photo a bouquet of flowers don t leave it out in the open normalize having guy friends over have girl friends over too emphasize to your parents that these boys are just friends the more regular and neutral these visits the better to warm your parents up to the idea of external male figures in your life tell them he s just a friend as weird as it may sound band your boyfriend with the rest at first if you ve played it cool enough your parents won t suspect a thing make him familiar to your parents as a friend after a while your parents will probably loosen up and become used to having him around this way when and if you choose to introduce him to them as your boyfriend they won t be as disapproving they will know him and have seen you interact and they will know that it is a healthy relationship never close the door to your room that just calls for your parents to get suspicious have a very open and casual friendship with him in front of your family so that they are not uncomfortable or second guessing anything consider when and whether it s time to tell your parents once they are friendly with him and are used to having him around you may choose to tell them about him or continue with how you re going whether they like him or not generally plays a large role in that 3 x research source think about why you haven t told them try to understand the underlying communication issues between you and your parents perhaps you don t want to tell your parents that you re dating someone of the same gender or someone from a different ethnic or religious background or someone significantly older than you maybe your parents have forbidden you from having a boyfriend period give yourself a clear picture of the situation so that you can decide how to move forward the longer you date this guy the more likely your parents will be to find out your life will be much easier if you don t have to sneak around consider whether your parents would be okay with it perhaps you re projecting your own worries onto them if you aren t sure ask a trustworthy sibling or relative for advice prove the stability of your relationship your parents might be suspicious of any new guy who comes into your life but this may just be because they care don t tell your parents the moment that you start dating this guy give it at least a few weeks or months before you break the news and try to introduce your boyfriend as a friend first if your parents learn to trust him they may be less hesitant to say no consider that your parents may have forbidden you from dating based on the abstract idea of a boyfriend a new and potentially threatening male presence in your life but that they might be a bit more lenient if the male presence is a friendly face this can be a great way to hide your boyfriend in plain sight you will need to be especially careful however not to let your parents interacting with him in a romantic way try to bring him around in groups and don t be too affectionate make sure that it s safe for you to tell them weigh the consequences of such a conversation if your parents wouldn t react well would disown you forbid you from seeing your boyfriend etc then it may be safer to wait if you don t feel comfortable telling your parents consider asking a teacher a relative or a community member to sit in as a moderator,Relationships

how to stop your partner from swearing,depending on your age location and culture swearing could be a socially acceptable part of your daily language or it could be inappropriate and even offensive many people swear when they re upset while others may lapse into vulgar language in regular conversation often without even realizing what they are saying if your partner is swearing and it s upsetting you or setting a bad influence for other family members you may need to work together to help your partner break their bad habit,address it before it s a problem perhaps you ve been dating for a while and your partner has held back on swearing but now that you re comfortable in the relationship they ve suddenly started swearing or perhaps your partner has always sworn and you ve simply dealt with it as best you could whatever your situation might be it s important to talk to your partner about their bad habit as early as possible if you wait you ll only grow resentful some researchers refer to a partner s bad habits in a relationship as social allergies the habits are a minor annoyance at first but over time they can lead to annoyance resentment and even disgust 1 x research source if your partner s language is a significant problem to you or if you believe it may become more of a problem for you in the future you owe it to have an honest and straightforward discussion with your partner as with any bad habit the sooner you address it the better it will be for you and your relationship be kind and understanding your partner may have learned to swear from their family friends or even coworkers many people are exposed to vulgar language socially and those individuals probably do not see their swearing as anything offensive or hurtful your partner s swearing may upset you but it s important to remember that they love you and do not necessarily engage in this habit to hurt or upset you let your partner know that you love them and that you do not resent them for who they are at the same time though you need to be upfront and communicate to them in no uncertain terms that their behavior upsets you 2 x research source don t discount your partner s feelings or lapse into judgmental behavior as this may alienate your partner and create further tension 3 x research source use i statements to convey that your partner s behavior upsets you you statements tend to communicate anger accusation or frustration whereas i statements address the way you feel about the behavior 4 x research source instead of saying your language is awful and you re unpleasant to be around say something less hurtful and less absolute such as i love you and i m not trying to judge you but your language is a problem for me convey what you want it s not enough to point out problematic behavior you need to go a step further and let your partner know what you d like them to do instead giving criticism without guidance or direction towards whatever you d prefer as an alternative may make your partner get defensive or feel like they re being picked on 5 x research source have an honest back and forth dialogue about what you d like your partner to do instead and ask for their honest feedback agree to a progression work on curbing casual swearing first as some language patterns like swearing while in pain for example may be more difficult for your partner to break after casual swearing has been eliminated work on your partner s swearing when they re upset the last step and potentially the most difficult will be to eliminate reactive swearing like swearing in response to an injury or shock be willing to compromise don t be upset if your partner is willing to stop swearing in front of you but wants to keep swearing when they re with friends or family members remember that swearing may be a social language for your partner and expecting them to change how they interact with friends coworkers or relatives may be exceedingly difficult talk to your partner about their limits and convey your own expectations and concerns dialogue is important through this entire process if you and your partner are not equally communicating what you want and what you are willing to compromise on it can quickly lead to arguments and feelings of resentment develop concrete goals your partner s behavior isn t going to change overnight and it would be unreasonable to expect such a radical transformation however you should have a frank conversation with your partner about how you will measure their relative success in the effort to stop swearing talk to your partner about your expectations and theirs to determine how you will mark their progress and the eventual accomplishment of the goal and remember to make s m a r t goals specific achievable results focused and time bound 6 x research source set incremental goals don t expect change to happen overnight but don t give your partner a never ending timeframe or they won t be motivated to make any progress ask your partner what they think would be a reasonable timeframe and try to focus on negotiations instead of demands find ways to motivate your partner if your partner is willing to work on controlling their language in some form or another try to meet them halfway find out what would make them happy or motivate them on a day to day basis and try to help keep them on track by being their supporter rather than their critic 7 x research source ask your partner what they like and what would help keep them motivated they may have some kind of minor indulgence like getting takeout from a favorite restaurant or going out with friends after work which could help keep them motivated and on some kind of progress schedule try creating alternative words one way to reduce swearing is to provide your partner with alternative words to use you can come up with words together even making up nonsensical words that will help replace your partner s vulgar language even as you work to control your partner s swearing their need for expressive words will not diminish coming up with euphemisms or nonsensical words can be a fun and humorous bonding exercise set up a swear jar a swear jar is a great way to create low stakes consequences for swearing without actually punishing your partner every time your partner swears ask them to put a dollar in the swear jar let the money build up while you help your partner try to achieve their goals and at the end only once they ve met whatever goals you ve set together you can use that money for a fun night out together 8 x research source a swear jar may seem like a punishment but it can actually act as a sort of motivation over time as more money accumulates your partner will realize that that money won t be spent on a fun date night until they stop swearing which may give them the push they need find ways to increase their awareness your partner may need gentle reminders whenever they slip up and swears but sometimes your words or a discontent expression on your face aren t enough the best way to help your partner break their bad habit is to help them find ways to increase their own awareness of what they say and work together to make them more aware of their words 9 x research source ask your partner to wear a rubber band around their wrist any time they slip up and swear tap your wrist to remind them to snap the rubber band use a dry erase board to tally up the swear words used each week any time they swear ask them to write down the word they said this can help your partner track their progress and see if their swearing is improving recognize your partner s triggers every bad habit has a trigger just as a smoker might have an extra cigarette after a stressful day at work your partner may indulge in swearing when they re upset scared stressed out or frustrated one important way to help support your partner is to learn what tends to set off their swearing and help them become aware of it too 10 x research source don t address swearing during a moment of anger or frustration as this may cause your partner to get angry with you or to escalate their anger at the situation at hand help your partner through moments of crisis wait until they re calm and then talk to them gently about how certain situations seem to set them off they may not even be aware of it themselves 11 x research source resist anger and punishment some people may think that getting angry or punishing a person will help curb that person s undesired behavior but getting angry or punishing your partner will only make them frustrated and it could cause them to feel hopeless and even resentful instead of focusing on punishment like withholding things your partner likes focus on celebrating their accomplishments no matter how small or minor they may seem to you 12 x research source remember that progress is slow and often marked by a series of minor victories and setbacks be patient and help your partner the best you can reward good behavior any time your partner avoids swearing in a heated moment or goes a duration of time without swearing praise them and celebrate that accomplishment it will make them feel good and it may give them motivation to keep at it don t just offer a big reward once the goal has been met you should have a goal for the end in mind but offer little goals along the way to help your partner feel your support 13 x research source be patient it bears repeating that no bad habit is going to change overnight if your partner has grown up with vulgar language breaking that habit may take months or even years the best thing for both of you and for your relationship in the meantime is to remain patient with your partner work to develop patience by changing your own mindset don t see your partner s slip ups as an indication of failure or a lack of effort on your part or theirs 14 x research source recognize that your partner is trying and continue to offer them support celebrate their accomplishments no matter how small remember that change takes time and patience your partner needs your support during times of change and struggle more than ever,Relationships
how to defend your girlfriend,a good boyfriend should be prepared to defend his girlfriend when her honor or safety is threatened knowing when to step in and when to step back is part of the process though when stepping in does become necessary you ll also need to know the safest and most effective strategies,stay calm 1 x research source before you do anything else calm down your temper may flare up the moment someone disrespects your girlfriend but if you act purely on adrenaline and testosterone there s a good chance you ll only make the situation worse than it needs to be be aware of any internal or external factors that might be influencing your judgment too for instance if you re at a bar when the incident occurs ask yourself if you ve had too much to drink and if the alcohol could be impairing your better judgment even when your anger is perfectly justified it still pays off to remain as calm as possible it ll be much easier to prevent the situation from becoming violent if at least one person involved you can remain even tempered 2 x research source get the details make sure that you re actually witnessing what you believe you re witnessing oftentimes the truth of the situation will be immediately obvious in some cases however you might be mistaken and there might not be any actual disrespect going on this is especially important when you walk into the situation halfway through for instance a guy might be attempting to flirt with your girlfriend without knowing she s already taken or the guy she s talking with so intimately might actually be a relative you ve never met if you make a move without knowing any of this the move you end up making could be the wrong one trust your girlfriend you need to trust your girlfriend in two separate but related matters trust her to remain loyal to you and trust her to take care of the minor incidents herself 3 x research source even if your girlfriend is making small talk with an obviously flirtatious guy it doesn t mean that she s going to dump you for him she could be trying to let him down gently trust her to remain faithful to you unless you have some concrete reason to believe otherwise on a similar note if you do have concrete reason to doubt your girlfriend s fidelity ask yourself if the relationship is really worth maintaining if you have to fight to keep her she might not be worth keeping 4 x research source your girlfriend will probably be able to handle minor sources of disrespect without your intervention after all there s a good chance she had to deal with things like this before she met you so she likely knows what to do the harassing party is generally less likely to become violent when dealing with a woman so letting her handle it can be a good way to prevent things from getting completely out of hand check your own motives ask yourself why you feel the desire to step in if you honestly want to defend your girlfriend s honor or safety you re off to a good start on the other hand if you feel the need to defend or claim your territory you might be acting out of jealousy rather than chivalry 5 x research source jealousy is a very human emotion that affects nearly everyone men and women alike nonetheless unchecked jealousy can be a very destructive force and it s usually best to avoid acting on it if you aren t sure what your motives are ask yourself what part of the situation bothers you if you feel personally insulted you might just be jealous if you re worried about how distressed your girlfriend seems or how dangerous the situation appears your motives are likely pure ignore the first incident unless the first offense is unforgivably terrible it s usually best to let it go you might need to offer your girlfriend some reassurance but don t confront the perpetrator just yet for example if a passerby shouts an insulting crude or otherwise disrespectful remark at your girlfriend it s probably best to let it go let your girlfriend know that you disapprove of the action and will intervene if the offender returns but don t chase him down on the other hand if someone tries to grab strike or otherwise physically threaten your girlfriend during the first incident you ll need to step in and immediately put a stop to it step in when things escalate stand up for your girlfriend once a single incident evolves into actual harassment at that point the perpetrator has already demonstrated that the abuse won t end until someone else forces it to end the escalation can be either verbal or physical if the same guy keeps forcing unwanted attention or continues to make harassing remarks it s obvious that he has no intention of quitting on his own defending your girlfriend at this point is both justifiable and honorable talk to your girlfriend about her level of discomfort when possible it s also a good idea to get your girlfriend s take on the current situation too you may not need to act if she doesn t feel alarmed or bothered by the disrespect watch for nonverbal cues too especially if you aren t able to talk to her about it if your girlfriend looks visibly uncomfortable or upset be ready to act on her behalf you should also trust your own instincts some people are naturally more trusting than others and if your girlfriend seems a little too trusting of someone who s giving you bad vibes you might need to intervene even if she doesn t feel bothered by the attention wedge yourself between them step in between your girlfriend and the wrongdoer by taking this stance you can break the offender s line of sight this sends both parties the message that you re prepared to defend your girlfriend if the need arises in essence you re taking a fighting stance without appearing overtly aggressive making brief eye contact with the offender as you step up lets him know that you ve got your eye on him but don t stare him down or intentionally try to look threatening try to maintain a tone of calm steady strength protect her with nonverbal language lean in close to her wrap your arm around her shoulders or waist take her by the hand give her a quick kiss or gently stroke her hair any simple yet intimate action should suffice intimate actions like these are an extension of your fighting stance the idea is to tell the offending party in no uncertain terms that you care for this girl and have every intention of protecting her from anyone who tries to create a problem since the focus here remains on your girlfriend though it s not overtly aggressive as such it s less likely to evoke an aggressive reaction from the offending party try to defuse the situation while rare there are certain circumstances in which the offender may not realize he s done anything offensive you might be able to stop the harassment simply by communicating with the perpetrator in a friendly manner 6 x research source for example if the offender s judgment is impaired by alcohol or if he s just really bad at picking up on social cues he may not have any bad intentions toward your girlfriend unless his actions undeniably fall into the category of harassment it might be best to give him the benefit of the doubt combine protective nonverbal actions with friendly speech toward the offender himself consider telling him in a lighthearted way that the girl he s pestering is your girlfriend and isn t interested in shopping around for a new guy draw a line if the wrongdoer refuses to take a hint you ll need to tell him directly that the harassment needs to end be as polite as possible but remain firm and resolute use strong wording but try to keep an even tone of voice saying you need to back off will work better than shouting it losing your cool only encourages him to do likewise avoid the use of expletives too littering your warning with cuss words might make you feel better but the raw emotion conveyed by those choice words might also incite him to violence recruit allies look around for others who might be willing to assist you in particular check among the perpetrator s friends it may seem counter intuitive but becoming the offender s buddy will be a more useful ally to have than a stranger this is especially useful if the offender is drunk and his friends are sober check his friends reactions when he speaks if they grimace or otherwise look uncomfortable they probably know that he s in the wrong asking them to help you defuse the situation before things get worse might encourage them to act accordingly leave before things escalate if the harasser refuses to back down it s better to walk away from the situation before the fight turns physical knowing when to quit isn t a sign of weakness or cowardice it might be hard to know when the breaking point will occur especially if you ve never encountered a situation like this before some people will strike without warning most however do give some indication beforehand if the offender s speech becomes increasingly violent or crass or if his nonverbal language becomes more aggressive it probably won t be long before he becomes physically violent toward you and your girlfriend call the authorities when necessary when things get really ugly don t be afraid to call the police doing so is actually the best possible option if you believe this stranger to be a threat to the physical well being of your girlfriend or yourself 7 x research source if the situation seems genuinely dangerous don t leave your girlfriend alone even for a reason that seems sensible both of you should greet the security guard or police officer don t leave her behind and do so by yourself since she might be more vulnerable to an attack while you re gone know some self defense picking a fight with the offender is never a good idea but if he decides to throw the first punch you will probably need to fight back consider learning some basic self defense for this purpose 8 x research source typically you won t get into much if any trouble for committing an act of violence when you can prove that it was done in self defense only go as far as you need to though if one punch is enough to stop the aggressor s attack stop there instead of continuing to pummel him,Relationships

sure what you re doing next week some people are more comfortable with setting far off plans and some people prefer to figure out their plans as they go along and that s perfectly okay if you re in a relationship with someone who s more plan happy than you are you ll need to strike a balance between their comfort zone and yours make time for yourself it s easy to feel overwhelmed if you aren t

you in a lie he probably won t be very quick to forgive or call you again be upbeat this means keeping things lighthearted be fun and playful and avoid being negative around your guy archers are generally happy active people who want to have a good time try to avoid complaining or speaking negatively about others go out of your way to make your time with your archer fun laugh and smile a lot and make fun suggestions like going out on the dance floor or doing a fun activity together challenge him sagittarius guys love a girl who is unpredictable and always keeps them guessing while this does not necessarily mean you should play hard to get you should challenge him a bit play coy and make him work for your affection don t show him that you are interested act indifferently around him but don t ignore him altogether 2 x research source archers also love to be challenged mentally you must be clever to catch an archer debate him on topics that you are both interested in play the devil s advocate and take the opposing view from the one he holds even if you secretly agree with him have a love of travel sagittarius guys never stay in one place for very long so you are going to need a love of travel and adventure to capture the attention of an archer when you first start talking with him ask him about his travels and then relate some of your own this may also be a great time to play up your mysterious side by giving vague answers about why you went to a certain place 3 x research source suggest things to do that involve a little bit of traveling plan an adventure day in which the two of you explore an area neither of you have been before drive out into the country and stop at every place that looks interesting world s largest corn maze lets do it a pie shop on a huge farm where you can learn to milk cows lets do it etc be flirtatious sagittarius guys love to flirt don t be afraid to simply walk up to him and begin a conversation a very flirtatious conversation the

the room catch his gaze then drop your eyes while slightly smiling then slowly draw your eyes back to his and don t look away until he drops his gaze give him your best come hither look do not act overly clingy a big part of the sagittarius personality is his love of freedom whether it s hitting the open road on his latest adventure or simply having some time alone probably going on a run or

resist a woman who looks fabulous why would an archer be any difference arches love women who are put together dressed well and sexy but without being too revealing if you know your sagittarius guy is going to be at a party or bar you are heading to tonight might be the night to break out that flirty dress you haven t worn yet and those sexy stilettos no man and certainly not an archer will be able

how to treat a virgo,do not underestimate the gentle virgo virgos are very distinct virtuous people perfectionist virgos can be hard to please but if you are capable of it they will be extremely loyal and loving remembering to be considerate and loyal can help you build a better relationship with the virgo in your life whether he or she is a friend family member or romantic partner,don t play mind games virgos view mind games and manipulation as dishonest sneaky and beneath them and will spot such pettiness a mile away they won t trust or respect you if you try this be considerate of your virgo s feelings what s going on inside a virgo s mind is often a mystery to those around them as they are capable of disguising their feelings well when they are brought to the point of expressing their displeasure with a person or situation it is often to the surprise of those around them virgo is patient and kind but only has so much patience and kindness and when it s gone it s gone they can sometimes bottle their feelings up out of politeness and later explode or worse simply drop you pay attention to your own personal hygiene and appearance virgos are perfectionists and are usually well groomed pay attention to your nails scent hair make yourself look nice your virgo friend may comment if they think you need a little help but they are rarely malicious or mean when doing this when a virgo feels strongly about something don t waste your time trying to change his or her mind not only are virgos passionate about what they believe they have typically put much thought and research into it and are unlikely to back down from any argument virgos are extremely observant nothing escapes this sign and can run circles around their opponents in a debate do not take your virgo friend or lover for granted virgos are fiercely loyal dedicated and give 100 percent to their loved ones but they won t be used or abused once virgos make up their minds that they ve been egregiously wronged they will promptly show you the door with little drama if they suspect they are in a one sided relationship or friendship you will get a one way ticket out of their lives virgos may seem cruel in their ability to quickly disengage emotionally but their logical side will not allow them to mope for long it is next to impossible to win a virgo back once he or she has moved on virgos are sensitive creatures who typically hold themselves in high regard because they know they put a great deal of effort into everything they do compliments like you look beautiful today or you re my best friend are definitely appreciated and will go a long way virgos make an effort in all areas due to being such perfectionists so a compliment makes them feel their efforts haven t gone unnoticed they will usually compliment you back sincerely and a virgo lover will reward you enthusiastically do not point out virgos flaws as they are well aware of them when they are unable to look or act their best for example due to illness they will be extremely agitated by the situation never ever insult your virgo or embarrass him or her in public virgos are acutely aware of everyone s flaws but especially their own and are highly sensitive to criticism they do not forget humiliation virgos try to see the humor in things and enjoy the lighter side of life try making them laugh they love funny tv shows movies plays and comedians to make intelligent virgo laugh can sometimes be a little tough but succeed and they will be impressed and interested virgos make excellent friends and companions but you must be worthy of their love and respect they might be friends with a lot of people but in reality they only have a small circle of people they really trust if a virgo considers you a close friend be grateful loyal unselfish virgo loves nothing more than supporting their friends and will cheerfully put their loved ones needs first listen when a virgo talks to you they are good listeners themselves and find it rude when ignored or interrupted don t be pompous or stuck up self sufficient virgo cannot stand people who act spoiled rotten and feel a sense of entitlement as if the world owes them something and while virgos are typically well educated and cultured they do not tolerate pretentious people understand that virgos will listen to your advice but will most likely do something else nonetheless they will do whatever is best for them for example if they ask you should i pick the red one or the black one and you say i like the red one they will consider it but then they will choose the black one don t get insulted they considered your idea but went with theirs comprehend that even though they are sensitive they can be very defensive if you pick a fight with a virgo just because they look gentle and defenseless think twice they have a spine of steel and a tongue to match don t tell them too much information too quickly volunteering very personal or intimate things can make virgos feel a little uncomfortable and put on the spot to reciprocate it takes time to build enough trust for a virgo to confide in you in return be careful with what you say if you said something bad last year they will still remember that and use it against you virgo women in particular make excellent wives and mothers because of their gentle and loving nature their perfectionism is an asset in the kitchen and they are not shy about painting a room or staining furniture they will keep a beautiful home and raise happy well mannered children be generous with the compliments on a virgo s cooking immaculate home and other household accomplishments as she takes great pride in her domestic abilities be tactful and diplomatic because they have no tolerance for rude tactless people control your temper around virgos as they see quick anger as a weakness if you re not naturally intelligent you d better be gifted with conversing virgos love interesting conversations due to mercury in their sign or having a unique character otherwise virgos will not waste their wit and charm on someone they feel is inferior this is why some people regard virgos as boring it is not necessarily the fault of the virgo but more likely the virgo in question wasn t enamored enough with the person to care about making a lasting impression they know they have many positive attributes and can win over a crowd if they didn t hate being the center of attention so much but they reserve their charm for possible mates and new friends if you re a woman don t act dumb or dress too over the top in front of a virgo woman even a virgo man won t find it appealing also if you re a female never flirt with a virgo s man virgos in long term relationships guard it with their lives and will react with hostility to anyone who threatens that relationship virgos will flinch at constructive criticism but humbly accept it however negative criticism meant to be hurtful will not be taken too kindly and the response will be very ugly never ever insult your virgo virgos are very insightful and intuitive so always tell the truth and be genuine if the truth hurts then they will expect you to use their tact and diplomatic talents they don t like people who are fake or dishonest virgos are very well mannered and refined so you will have no chance of being friends with one if you are ignorant obnoxious vulgar selfish rude a slob or ask for sex on the first date however kind hearted virgo is capable of looking for the best in people and may give you one chance if you have only a few poor qualities among good core qualities so long as you show a desire for self improvement virgos value substance if you re looking to date one you must be interesting deep and a little bit mysterious but not so aloof to the point where they feel they are not needed they will see through it and lose interest more often than not when talking about astrology virgos like to be angels over virgins when discussing or even bringing up birth signs don t be fooled by the term virgin sign virgos are typically introverts and extremely picky when selecting a lover but they place great importance on sex and sexual compatibility your virgo may seem shy at first but being patient and establishing trust will lead to a deeply intense passionate and exciting sex life virgos are unselfish and creative in bed and take pride in keeping their lovers satisfied and fulfilling their every desire virgos value fidelity and trust above all in a relationship when virgos find their true love they will devote themselves completely and unselfishly but they expect the same loyalty in return you will not get a second chance if you are unfaithful don t go through their stuff if you think a virgo is keeping something from you express your concerns with honesty but don t invade their privacy don t try to force virgos to do anything they hate virgos are fiercely independent and will not tolerate people with controlling personalities as they have an insatiable desire for success on their own terms if they feel like you are trying to force your own views on them they will be turned off if a virgo likes you he or she will let you know they try so hard to find their true love and will not play games,Relationships

mystery being in a relationship with a scorpio woman can be an intense and thrilling experience but it also has the potential to grow into a long lasting relationship focus on being honest and trustworthy giving her space to be herself and planning thoughtful surprises it may take some time to get her to open up but it ll be worth it,be assertive confident and sincere to get her attention women who identify as scorpios are generally driven and confident and don t want to waste time on someone shy deceitful or unsure of themselves she ll be able to tell if you re putting on a front so start things off right by being yourself 1 x research source being assertive doesn t mean the same thing as being aggressive you can be assertive by speaking confidently and by standing behind what you believe take your time pursuing her to create an air of mystery if you come on strong with your romantic feelings you risk pushing her away it can be hard to gain a scorpio woman s trust so take the time to get to know her likes dislikes hobbies and friends try some of these fun ways to get to know her better 2 x research source pay attention to her social media to see what kinds of things she likes ask her open ended questions to get her to talk about herself more try saying tell me more to get her to share more personal information with you invite her to go out for a drink or meal so you can spend one on one time together avoid being clingy or controlling a scorpio woman typically loves her independence and astrologists say that a major turn off is when someone tries to cramp her lifestyle if you call or text her try to not contact her again until she responds to you if she turns down a date or says she s busy wait a week before trying again avoid telling her how she should act dress or deal with a situation unless she asks for your advice 3 x research source if she does ask for your help or opinion about something that is a great sign and means she s beginning to trust you shower her with thoughtful gifts and compliments to show you know her pay attention to what she likes and talks about to get gift ideas when you pay her a compliment make it specific and while you can compliment her looks don t neglect her intelligence humor and attitude too 4 x research source for example if she mentions that she loves a specific coffee shop stop by there and get her a gift card or if she is always running late because she was just hitting the gym you could get her a gift certificate for a massage or a new yoga mat to compliment her sincerely keep things specific for example instead of saying you look nice today say something like that color of green brings out your beautiful eye color or tell her you admire something she accomplished recently like running a marathon or acing a presentation at work plan romantic surprises to sweep her off her feet a romantic weekend away a dinner at a high end restaurant tickets to her favorite musical grand gestures can go a long way in getting her to fall for you plus taking a risk and planning something big shows her that you re confident and willing to take charge sometimes 5 x research source romantic surprises don t have to be expensive for example if she is a book lover surprise her by taking her to a reading by an author she loves or plan a special picnic lunch complete with champagne be 100 honest otherwise you risk losing her trust while she may like a little bit of mystery lying and dishonesty will ruin your relationship commit to telling the truth and acting in a trustworthy way this means not having other relationships on the side or hiding anything from her 6 x research source if you did lie about something come clean about it before she catches you for example if you told her you quit smoking but haven t it d be better to talk to her about the situation rather than have her find a pack of cigarettes in your pocket keep her in the loop so she feels secure in your relationship astrologists say that scorpio women while fiercely independent also like to feel secure in a relationship in fact that s often why it takes them so long to settle down if you like her don t play games by ignoring her texts or calls or being unavailable for long periods let her know she is a priority and that you won t leave her hanging 7 x research source scorpio women like many women don t like games she doesn t want to question how important she is to you so don t make her respect her boundaries and encourage her interests and friendships a great way to keep your relationship vibrant is to make sure she is taking the time she needs for herself if she feels stifled or bored she s going to grow to resent you 8 x research source for example if there is a class she wants to take encourage her to register if she loves going out with her friends on the weekend don t try to monopolize all of her time allow her to take the lead to nurture her independence unless she gives you a signal that she wants you to take charge it ll help the balance in your relationship if you let her give advice and make decisions this will show her that you respect her intelligence and value her leadership 9 x research source as she trusts you more and more chances are she ll ask for your help with things but if you try to take control of the relationship she might withdraw from you experience and learn new things together to keep things fresh in addition to making sure that she feels independent and challenged in her personal life make sure you re experiencing things together to help create a stronger bond take a cooking class together travel somewhere new join a book club train for a triathlon or do a home project 10 x research source boredom and unvaried routine are bound to make her antsy every couple of weeks come up with something new to do if you feel like things are getting a little too normal,Relationships

how to attract a libra man,libra loves to love but you can scare off the libra man by getting too sentimental if you want to attract his attention and win his affections try appealing to his desire for balance and appreciation of beauty approach him with confidence but let him get comfortable with you at his own pace,join the crowd libra is definitely an extrovert who loves to socialize and be around other people you ll often find him in groups standing out as the life of the party if you want to attract him your best bet is to cross paths with him as often as possible in his natural setting a crowd stand out since most libra males have a tendency to be friendly with a lot of people in any given crowd you ll need to do more than just hang around him instead of lingering in the back of the room where no one can see you need to make yourself the center of attention even if only for a few moments win out over the competition libra is friendly sometimes a little too friendly your libra man is probably flirty with a lot of other women without necessarily meaning anything by it for some women this will be a turn off but others may not consider it to be a big deal if you have any hope of winning your libra man s affections you need to belong to the latter group hang around long enough until the rest of his admirers lose patience with his flirtatious ways keep in mind that libras rarely have favorites even if you attract him quickly he might also be attracted to several other women within his social circles if you want his budding attraction for you to win out over the attraction he feels toward other women you need to stick things out for as long as possible be feminine and elegant not frilly or flashy visually speaking women with a notably feminine appearance are the most likely to catch the libra man s eye and attract him on a purely physical level your style should be classic clean and refined avoid fashion choices that are excessively bold or those that are too cutesy avoid jarring color choices bold patterns or temporary trends that are here today and gone tomorrow excessively girly fashions like lace and bows can also be a turn off opt for classic clean cut styles in a traditional color palette choose elegance rather than trendiness the theme of refinement should also extend into your make up and accessories use your make up to enhance your natural beauty and avoid caking it on or trying out dramatic looks any jewelry you wear should accent your look without competing for attention present a pleasant balanced personality within the zodiac libra is represented by the image of scales and with good reason your libra hunk gravitates toward balanced situations and people when you first start talking to him have a pleasant mild mannered attitude and present an overall balanced aura similarly when you invite a libra into your own personal space your office your car your apartment make sure that he s greeted with refined balanced style let him talk about himself it s not that libra is narcissistic but as someone with an outgoing personality he does have a definite tendency to ramble on about himself and the things that interest him if you want to impress him let him talk to his heart s content and follow along with the conversation sincerely engage in light debate 1 x research source most libra men will run from direct conflict or confrontation but at the same time they also enjoy looking at matters from various perspectives bring up a topic that might be open for debate and discuss both sides with him just remember to keep the conversation intellectual rather than emotional compliment him libra men are usually rather confident and have positive opinions about themselves a genuine well timed compliment or word of praise can go a long way in capturing his attention when choosing something to compliment on focus on a typical libra area of interest like his sense of taste style or justice no one trusts an obvious flatterer not even a libra man while he might pardon a blatant appeal to his vanity more than some of the other signs will a compliment that is clearly untrue or forced lacks the sort of harmony and fairness that a libra ultimately longs for as such any compliments you do make should be as meaningful and truthful as possible bring up an eclectic mix of conversational topics impress your libra crush by talking to him about a variety of subjects libras like to talk and they like to express ideas and exchange opinions on as many topics as possible if you can keep him intellectually stimulated he will find your personality more attractive and enjoyable to be around libras naturally have somewhat of an airy personality so they feel most inspired when they are allowed to move about from thing to thing fixating on any one topic can quickly make a libra man feel bored act honestly and justly libras crave balance and that balance extends beyond your libra s personal life as a general rule libras have a great sense of dedication to justice and fairness if you want to seem like an attractive person in his eyes you need to make sure that he views you as someone with a similar dedication to justice ease up on the emotions even though libras love to be around people most libra men have a tendency to be emotionally detached when he first starts getting to know you avoid showing too much emotion either positive or negative try to understand why he feels uncomfortable with emotion feelings are messy especially once those feelings get deep and complicated the libra avoids emotions mostly to maintain the sense of harmony and balance he loves so much of course if you want to be with your libra man for a long time you and he will eventually need to confront your emotions together when the times comes do so in as calm and rational a manner as possible while you are only in the introductory stages though it s better to avoid heavy emotions as much as possible keep the pressure off related to libra s distaste for emotions is his aversion to conflict even though he likes intellectual debate emotionally charged debate tends to be a big turn off keep a calm casual attitude when dealing with your libra to avoid sending him running give him a little mystery you need to be open and talkative with your libra but weaving in a carefully constructed thread of mystery can really catch this inquisitive sign s curiosity and make him long to know more if you can trigger this sense of longing you can capture his attraction more readily his earliest impressions of you should view you as a mysterious beauty of course the longer you re with your libra the more that mystery will fade to pack a strong punch at the start though try to be an elusive nearly inaccessible goal to strive for do some volunteer work most libras have a bit of an altruistic spirit so they might be involved in volunteer work of some sort even if your guy does not have a charity or cause he actively takes part in he will likely find someone who does sacrifice her time for a noble purpose exceptionally attractive if you are actively volunteering your time somewhere consider asking your libra crush along especially if you are supporting a cause he also happens to believe in in doing so you ll become someone who helps him satisfy his own desires to do good works vary your hobbies libra has a hard time focusing on one thing and may find you less attractive if he believes you to be fixated on only one aspect of life if you want to look like someone who has a balanced well rounded personality you should try having a few different hobbies to talk to him about appeal to his love of beauty art or music most libra men can really appreciate beauty and culture so if you want to make his heart skip a beat for you invite him to the art museum or give him a book with photographs of beautiful scenery showing him that you understand what he loves can be a huge plus in your favor when you extend an invitation pick a place that your libra man will probably enjoy like an art gallery arts and crafts fair or museum 2 x research source you can appeal to him even more by inviting him out during an active time for instance ask him to a special one day only exhibit instead of inviting him to the museum during a quiet off time treat him to a taste of luxury along with art and culture libra men usually have a strong appreciation for the finer things in life when you invite him to spend time with you choose impressive locations like trendy cafes or four star restaurants when you give him a gift consider picking out something tasteful from a designer if you do not have the finances to back libra s love of luxury fear not these men are interested in refinement but that refinement does not necessarily need to cost you an arm and a leg try inviting him to a fancy restaurant for dessert only to save you the cost of a meal or go somewhere with an elegant atmosphere but a moderate cost give him space as social creatures libra men love freedom and need to feel unconfined in order to be happy you can dote on him as much as you want when the two of you are together but avoid smothering him or forcing your way into areas of his life he hasn t invited you to on his own keep in mind that libra is an active guy so once he takes a liking to you you ll probably know about it in the meantime work on him steadily and avoid pushing your feelings onto him before he is ready for them show him some appreciation libra men love to love and they love being loved on little tokens of appreciation can underscore your feelings for him while making you appear more attractive in his eyes try giving him a small gift or note for no reason or offer a massage at the end of a long day or week refined tasteful gifts tend to work better than gifts packed with too much sentimentality you might not be able to afford a designer watch or pricey cufflinks but you could try offering him a small helping of designer candy or any beautiful yet non designer item if you want a free alternative you could try writing him a beautiful note again heavy emotions are not quite the libra s cup of tea but a letter with a few scribbled verses can make a big impact as long as those verses focus on the beauty of things rather than the intensity of your feelings keep the romance simple as mentioned earlier libra men can be emotionally detached when you first get to know them and as such they tend to avoid women who seem manipulative or who live for drama when you make your move avoid getting too serious too quickly keep things light and win him over with gestures of traditional romance candlelight dinners moonlit walks and so on once he starts to return your attraction and affection be prepared for him to show you what he likes in the romance department libra is a natural born charmer so when he wants to charm you he will use a range of romantic tactics to do so take note and increase his attraction to you by responding with similarly romantic gestures,Relationships

he can handle his bull headedness his need for routine and his need to lead by all means this could be a relationship that lasts a very very long time but if these are factors that you can t see yourself tolerating long term try not to get your heart twisted in a bunch he can make for a good fling but little else develop a routine together taurus likes his routine and his woman will need to be a part of it so carve out a space for yourself make him part of your routine and vice versa the deeper ingrained you two become in each other the harder it ll be to break this does not by any stretch of the imagination mean that you two have to be involved in every aspect of each others lives no no no it simply means to have routine hobbies and activities that you two do together that you can depend on stir friday bowling league saturday morning mimosas you each still need your own life but each other has their definite solid part practice nonviolent communication and work with his ego sometimes men can get pretty defensive when it comes to their manhood and taurus is no different in fact he may be the cause for this gender stereotype his pride and ego dominate a large facet of his nature if you attack this he will not be happy make sure allow him to lead you on occasion he ll love it and love you for it there are delicate ways to do everything if you two are fighting this does not mean backing down and saying you re right honey i m sorry unless he is right of course it means saying i don t understand what this has to do with that can you explain it to me with taurus a certain amount of tact will get you a long long way know you may need to draw him out if you re looking for a man that will shower you with adoration taurus isn t it sure he s very capable of being affectionate but he may take his precious time if you can muster it be patient show him you re comfortable being caring and demonstrative and he will echo you back don t be discouraged if he s not as caring as you d like him to be if it s an issue address it he ll value your honesty and straightforwardness give him a while to come around to the idea he s worth the wait you know work on trusting each other along with being aloof and slow to make his move taurus can be a bit untrusting he s very much so of the mantra if you want something done right you do it yourself this leaks into his romantic relationships too where he s used to doing his own thing however over time if you show him you re trustworthy and responsible he ll see it makes sense to let his guard down that s when you know you ve won taurus s heart if you re all these things honest practical diplomatic and patient there will be no issue trust will just fall into place make it clear that your loyalty lies with him and only him if he trusts you he ll show it back that means he s in it to win it,Relationships

active signs preferring the rough and tumble of physical adventure over the easy predictability of domesticity in order to click with an aries you need to enjoy that side of yourself gone are the days of sitting in front of the tv on fridays and sundays get ready to meet mother nature and sweat like a sow women usually like a great walk on the beach but aries might rather go kite surfing instead or

really gets her heart pumping many aries love rock climbing play and watch sports with her women are thought to be disinterested in sports but usually not aries she might not like the passivity of watching sports but she s sure to embrace the opportunity to play them invite her along when you play pickup basketball with your buddies or take her on a date to a football game indulge her impulsive side aries will often act before they think that can sometimes lead to a little trouble but aries love the adventure of wriggling out of trouble too don t be afraid to act on your impulsive side or accept hers when you re around her many aries can t stand a partner who doesn t know how to fly by the seat of his pants from time to time take her on an unplanned date try showing up unannounced and whisk her off to a sculpting class followed by a bar if she on the slim chance has other plans or isn t ready to jump down the rabbit hole shrug it off and try again another time don t moan or take it as a slight against your character this will make her upset don t let too much of your shy side show even if it s a big part of who you are aries find it hard to understand why other people are shy they re extroverted communicating their feelings easily and readily if you re a shy one don t put your shy side front and center during the first couple of dates it s not that she can t love it it s that she simply doesn t understand it if you can show her in the beginning that your shyness doesn t define you there s a chance that she can eventually learn to live with it and love it give her freedom and independence aries need to feel that they are free to do anything they want even if that s not strictly the case don t cling to her like a squid to its prey keep her in your sights and engaged but never smothered as soon as you complain that she hasn t made enough time with you or is hanging out with another guy too much you ve stifled her sense of freedom lover beware don t rush her into the relationship if you two are doing things together but haven t begun calling yourselves a couple don t sweat it it ll take her time to come around most likely even if she isn t calling you a boyfriend you re benefiting from the arrangement don t forget that be prepared for a burning but straightforward sexuality aries women tend to know what they want they don t debate the intricacies of sex like other signs do even if they enjoy it very much aries women will be straightforward with you they ll tell you want they want and expect to get it unless you can give them a really good reason why it s a bad call aries can have an emotional selfishness which can sometimes detract from the spiritual nature of sex if you re expecting sex to be a tantric fusing of two persons souls expect again aries probably has a different idea of what it is on the other hand many aries have a romantic side to their personality one that juts out from their other tendencies if you learn to nurture this romantic side which you will as time goes on you can generally expect sex to look a lot different from how it was in the beginning never make things more complicated than they need to be aries is nothing if not uncomplicated an aries won t try to play mind games with you an aries won t expect you to know something without first telling you an aries won t belabor the meaning of love if it doesn t mean something practical to her at the end of the day learn to understand this part of her personality and be the same way with her keep things simple without boring the heck out of her take risks with her but make her feel like she s there with you for each step of the way tap into that adventurous inner child spirit that she gets along with so well and don t be afraid to take risks consider traveling with her nothing says romance more to an aries than the adventure of travel being in a novel place with different sights sounds and customs will help fuel the fire of her passion just make sure she s ready to take the jump with you start a whole new career path or direction in life although this is more for you than for her it can feel like it affects her more than usual because she likes to experience adventure vicariously when she s not experiencing it firsthand just be sure the new change in direction is good for you too be selectively liberal with the money that you spend the key word here is selectively aries are notoriously spendthrift so you also want to balance out her freewheeling wildness with a little bit of tact but you don t want to scare her away with any penny pinching either so learn to let loose on occasion it ll help make her feel validated bounce back from crises and setbacks since aries are often bold bossy and boisterous you re inevitably going to get into arguments with her or see things a different way try to be calm and forgiving throughout the entire argument if you reach an impasse give her an out say something like let s talk about this when our tempers have cooled don t take any wrenching personal attacks to heart she s impulsive and wants to win at any cost even if it means winning the argument what you ll have to deal with is teaching her how to compromise she ll see compromise as losing and stay away from it at all costs your goal will be to explain to her that compromise isn t the same thing as losing in fact that it s essential to a relationship learn to communicate your needs in order to keep the relationship humming aries can be blissfully unaware of what your needs are if you don t explicitly let her know she s extroverted and communicative so she expects you to be the same know that aries women work exceptionally well with leo men aries females work well with all fire signs generally but leo july 23 to august 24 excites her most both are domineering and alpha types but leo s encouraging and generous nature really makes aries hum at times though leo s dramatic nature can butt heads with

december 21 and aries share a fierce independent streak feeding off of one another but he s so independent that he might just out independent her and walk out before the relationship starts still they

aries both share a restlessness and sense of adventure he can be fickle however and aries can cause him to retreat if she s just a little too straightforward know that aries women work very well with

how to date an aquarius woman,aquarius women are a paradox trying to figure this woman out is like trying to rope the wind she will have inconsistency and confusion in her life this woman can come in two forms either shy sensitive gentle and patient or exuberant lively and exhibitionist in the event that you re trying to date or attract an aquarius woman please continue to read for some insights on how to understand them,trust in and flatter her open mindedness aquarius women are variously described as bohemian eccentric unusual or even a little quirky use this knowledge to your advantage aquarius women want love but not the cookie cutter version you find in hollywood movies do the unpredictable stay loose sometimes consciously do something acceptable but out of the ordinary encouraging her to join you make sure your dates aren t too conventional or she might lose interest don t waste your time with too many compliments aquarius women have more a devil may care mentality and generally aren t looking for approval from the rest of society give her one unusual compliment and leave it at that your interest in her should already be apparent stimulate all her senses aquarius women want all their senses to be stimulated although not at the same time of course she wants to do things out of the ordinary and she wants her senses to be tickled at every step of the way here are some ideas for dates take her to a museum with contemporary art the more outre the better going glass blowing might be a good idea as well these will stimulate her visual sense take her to a szechuan restaurant or maybe for some israeli street food or perhaps for some caribbean jerk chicken these should stimulate her sense of smell and taste take her to a concert that features some unusual music maybe look for some traditional vietnamese folk music or some salt of the earth underground rock a classical concert will probably not be her thing don t try to bind her aquarius women love their freedom she doesn t want to be tied to home or family especially early on in the dating so don t mention your desire your kids and a blissful domestic life just quite yet concentrate on improvising and staying loose for the time being take the relationship slower in the beginning coming on too strong too fast could scare her away remember not to be clingy don t let her know that you re pinning your hopes and dreams on her even if you are she won t want you to control her be prepared to deal with her erratic nature it s not so much that she ll say one thing one day and do something else the next it s that she s constantly exploring experimenting and building up information about novel things be prepared for this although aquarians are very well rounded they can be social butterflies and flit about without appearing to have a direction aquarius women are very social and love to be around people meeting new and interesting people is one of their favorite pastimes so let them feel like they have that option don t be surprised if she s off with other guy friends too she can be emotionally detached until they fall in love and so in some instances it may seem like she s paying undue attention to other guys shake that feeling off jealousy will not augur well for your relationship give the courtship time to develop although aquarians are air signs they are by no means a whirlwind date this means that you need to take the courtship slow in the beginning she can be committed to someone but needs to be sure don t expect to woo her in a week it takes time for her to let you into her inner circle but once she does you ll have the key for quite some time challenge her but don t butt heads with her stubbornness since aquarius women are naturally intelligent they love hearing about new opinions and having opportunities to test out their logic that being said aquarians are also very stubborn people they do not make changes in their opinions or viewpoints very frequently so be prepared to back down from an argument even if you know that you re right don t derail her ambition as someone with lofty ideas she probably seeks position and power in this way she is unlike other signs remember to let her cradle and nurse her ambition for a while it will be her baby aquarius women tend not to see women on an unequal footing with men when in a relationship with an aquarius try not to suggest that women s role is subsidiary to man s it will make her mad beyond a doubt don t expect her to fit into the stereotypical housewife mold either if you do you re in for a sore surprise although aquarius women are very loving and loyal they don t necessarily feel challenged by domestic duties and tend to look down on that expectation aquarius women have big ideas and can generally make things happen but sometimes they appreciate some help with the details though their ideals are lofty they aren t always concerned with the practical details that perhaps is where you come in if she lets you don t be surprised when she tells you about other guy friends or lovers for the aquarius woman love is a sort of ideal quality to be enjoyed and celebrated not something that turns possessive or jealous she will talk about her exes and other guy friends and she expects you to treat them with the same respect that she does even if they pose risks to you learn to trust that her love for you is unconditional even if she doesn t show it in the way you d hope she probably won t marry unless you become her best friend first in her book friends are held in very high esteem almost equal with her lover she may think friends are forever and lovers can come and go so really concentrate on being her friend in order to enhance your love spice things up especially in bed an aquarian will leave the relationship if she becomes bored with it if you fall into the same routine day in and day out it doesn t feel right to her therefore learn to spice things up a bit let her feel like you re on the cutting edge of something so she ll always want to stick around for the ride she is not afraid to try new things in bed she likes to push the envelope which means everything from positions and scenarios to locations a little romp in the hay somewhere public but still secluded might be exactly what she wants know who she s especially compatible with aquarians are very sympathetic with libras geminis sagittariuses and arieses with libras this partnership is lively and fun loving great intellectual relationships low in intensity but great long term with geminis this partnership is one in which the aquarius is completely stimulated one second and frustrated the next albeit in a good way aquarius finds gemini completely irresistible making way for unconditional love with leos this partnership is rewarding and once they care it is unbreakable when they meet there is magic in the air and after some disagreements they discover how loyal in the deep sense they are these two opposites can make a long life entertaining partnership with sagittariuses a very passionate relationship sagittarius needs even more space than aquarius which gives her the freedom she most desires unusual but usually deeply successful with arieses a very physical relationship though the possibility of burnout is high aquarius loves aries independence and he stimulates her intellectual with his directness,Relationships

how to make a cancer man fall in love,every guy is different but men who fall under the cancer sign of the zodiac often share similar traits and fall in love in similar ways become the sort of woman a cancer man might desire if you want him to fall for you nurture him and connect to his sensitive side,maintain a stable life 1 x research source the cancer man typically has his life together and to some degree he may expect the same from you your accomplishments do not need to be the exact same as his but your life should demonstrate a certain degree of stability show him that you can take care of yourself without him you should have some direction for your life and be capable of caring for your basic needs resist the urge to depend on him materially even though most cancer males are capable of supporting you materially it s best to avoid that type of situation if the cancer guy in your life has any reason to suspect that you might be after his money he might cut himself off from you emotionally unless he offers to pay for you on every date you should take turns or occasionally split the bill don t make any demands regarding gifts or things you want him to buy if he does like to dote on you with various material gifts you should make sure that you give plenty to him as well the gifts do not need to be expensive but they should show a comparable amount of affection stand up for yourself you might be worried about making your sensitive cancer man upset if you argue with him but a healthy argument can actually increase the esteem he holds for you the key is making sure that your arguments are reasonable and healthy don t lash out aim for his weak spots or make unfair accusations when the time comes to reconcile don t hold back take care of your appearance generally speaking cancer men can be somewhat superficial regarding appearances you don t need to be a beauty queen but dressing up for him every now and then can certainly help your cause you don t need to do anything extreme but when you should generally maintain good hygiene wear a little make up and dress in clothes that flatter you scent can be another powerful tool look for a feminine flowery perfume body wash or shampoo make it your signature scent and let him learn to associate it with you 2 x research source behave in a graceful manner since cancer men are sensitive beings they can appreciate inward beauty as well as outward beauty try to go through life in a poised graceful manner losing your temper on occasion is natural and fine but it needs to be the exception to the rule and not your standard behavior empathize become an expert on his moods and emotions cancer men tend to be among the most emotional sensitive zodiac males if you can master the ability to decipher his moods and react accordingly you can find your way into his heart rather quickly when he feels distressed ask him about what s wrong if he hesitates let him open up at his own pace but make it clear that you are willing and eager to listen when he s not actively unhappy keep him laughing the typical cancer man loves to laugh so a woman who can keep him smiling will seem very appealing lean on him for emotional support drop your guard and let yourself be vulnerable in front of him most cancer men are fully capable of supporting you emotionally and actually appreciate having the opportunity to do so confide in him about your secrets turn to him first when you ve had a bad day he craves empathy from those he cares about and yearns to return it appreciate his thoughtful side you ll need to appreciate his thoughtfulness towards you and you ll also need to accept and encourage his thoughtfulness toward others even though most cancer men are loyal there can be times when they ll prioritize helping someone else over spending time with you don t be surprised if he rushes to the side of a sick friend or offers to assist a neighbor with a difficult task even if it means canceling a night with you to do so his sense of obligation can take over at inconvenient times and you ll need to learn how to tolerate that temper your words healthy arguments can be beneficial but lashing out or spouting spiteful insults won t be if you attack his weak points through your words you may cause him to put up a barricade between you and his heart he might be more sensitive to criticism than most so comments that cut him down will cause him to withdraw you can bring up constructive criticism or concerns when needed but stay away from criticisms that do nothing but insult him make a considerate gesture when your cancer man can feel how much you love him he might be more likely to fall in love with you in return do something nice for him without having a reason a little well timed kindness can go a long way when you say i love you make it meaningful passionate and genuine don t say it just to say it gifts that remind him of your relationship can be especially effective think photo albums love poems and trips to sentimentally significant spots like the place you first met for instance gestures that nurture are also a plus so you might try giving him a home cooked meal or a hand knitted scarf don t play the jealousy game you might be tempted to make your cancer man jealous by flirting with other guys but doing so will inevitably work against you most cancer males tend to lean on the possessive side so they can become jealous quickly and don t handle the emotion well deal with emotional problems immediately no matter who feels hurt you or him the two of you need to sit down and iron out your emotional difficulties as rapidly as possible his negative feelings probably won t vanish on their own and he may also expect your negative feelings to linger until resolved when he feels hurt he may withdraw from you until you offer him an honest apology on the other hand if you withdraw emotionally he can become clingy and demanding the only way to calm him down is to open your heart back up and make amends 3 x research source look for signs of affection since cancer men tend to be so sentimental you might know when he has fallen in love with you before he even says the words watch for a shift in his behavior if he becomes notably more affectionate towards you his heart may very well be yours increased levels of affection and consideration are good signs if he does a lot of hugging asking about your day and sensing your moods he might be falling for you similarly if he withdraws or seems notably hurt when you upset him it could mean that he has become emotionally attached to you 4 x research source give him time cancer men are usually intuitively aware of how sensitive they are so they know they can be hurt if they get involved with the wrong people it might take some time before he opens up to you but if you re consistent enough with your affections he should drop his guard eventually his need for emotional security can be pretty strong so he will need to sense a certain degree of emotion from you before he can let himself feel the same way once he feels certain of your feelings though he s more likely to be free and honest with his own talk about family if he fits the mold your cancer man will be fairly family oriented talk about your family and encourage him to talk about his if he senses a shared appreciation for family his affection for you may grow his idea of family might be broader than yours and can include aunts uncles cousins and other distant relatives some cancer men may even take things a little too far and dote on their family members more than necessary if he gets along well with your family though he may also come to love them as his own create a cozy environment due in part to his love of family the cancer male thrives in a warm cozy environment it nurtures his spirit and opens his heart creating that environment for the cancer man in your life can encourage him to open his heart to you welcome him into your home and show an interest in being a part of his spend time with him at home and indulge in plenty of one on one time spend time in nature one interest that most cancer men share is an appreciation for nature when you spend a day or evening together consider going to some spot that will allow the two of you to appreciate nature at its finest dragging him to a place he will love demonstrates a highly appealing level of consideration a weekend camping trip will probably mean more to him than a weekend getaway to a big city parks and other locations with scenic views are great for quick dates plan for the future don t be afraid to talk about the future with him cancer men are successful thanks to their ability to think ahead so they ll usually adore women who do likewise talk about your dreams and goals since most cancer guys have no problem with commitment discussions about your future together are usually safe too commit completely when your cancer guy gives his heart to you he will do so completely you need to be prepared to do likewise before you make him fall in love with you make sure that you can fall and stay in love with him too pay attention to him as an individual keep in mind that every guy is different and the ideas offered here are only guidelines you will need to pay attention to who your man is as an individual and act accordingly regardless of whether or not he fits the cancer profile,Relationships

appreciative if you can take the lead in social settings that make him uncomfortable having an ability to be sociable is a great asset to a capricorn buy him simplistic practical gifts capricorn guys enjoy functional things that aren t particularly flashy rather than getting him that 2 000 watch with all those rhinestones think along the lines of a swiss army knife or a grill for those backyard barbecues he loves so much keep the pda to a minimum pda public displays of affection are not really the capricorn s cup of tea while holding hands is probably fine he might even prefer holding hands because of his protective nature making out in the middle of a busy street will probably make him feel a bit uneasy capricorns don t really like having their private lives become public knowledge so

mutable sign meaning that these characteristics aren t tried and true but if you want to place em all in one category you ll find that they re generally solid people grounded have a foundation upon which they build everything thought or planning and at their best when they re balanced know that he may need reassurance virgos are often caught up in their heads because of this they can get a little out of touch with reality resulting in an unconscious tendency toward insecurity when this time pops up he may need reassurance when he s acting inhibited with you let him know that that s unneeded not with your words necessarily be overly welcoming he may need that extra push take this and value it instead of wishing he were more open and confident realize that this quality makes him down to earth modest loyal and way less of a showy megalomaniac than the sign that precedes him leo this sense of insecurity that flares up on occasion can be a relief don t think of him as a know it all because he notices every little detail many people can think of him as a know it all he takes one look at your pie charts and tells you they re 1 off not only does he notice it but he says something about it too this can be irksome if you don t realize he s just trying to make everything the best it can be and why shouldn t it be the good thing about virgo is that if you know your stuff too he can take it he is open to debate and loves talking about things he s learned and experienced so the next time your virgo corrects you on something don t hesitate to say no i did it this way on purpose and explain why understand his hesitancy to act virgo as described earlier doesn t jump to anything from relationships to conclusions he needs to plan everything out how else would he know if it s perfect and above all acceptable so when he doesn t give you that grand display of love right off the bat don t get your heart all a flutter he needs time allow him that your relationship may be slow to start this is fine it s just how virgo rolls it s not an indicator of a lack of passion or anything negative he ll open up in time if you can be patient good things are worth waiting for after all know he s more practical than poetic when it comes to romantic gestures your virgo man won t be into writing you songs about your left pinky toe that s just not useful why would he waste his time doing that but he will offer you his sweatshirt when you re cold he will open the door for you he will give you the perfect gift on your anniversary because those things actually are meaningful that s the good stuff anyway who wants a poem about their toe this can be frustrating when you re looking for affection and you re feeling particularly feely they won t reciprocate and don t seem to get it

how to attract a gemini girl,to be with a gemini is to know two different people she has a dual nature and is capable of displaying different personality traits at different points of time however both sides of her can be equally eye catching and intriguing if you re ready for quite the ride a gemini girl is for you,be ready to be surprised gemini is represented by twins equal parts yin and yang this at any time you never know which twin you re going to get one minute she ll be laughing and childlike and the next minute she ll be serious and reserved if you can handle both sides you have a chance with this dynamic female you never know what you re going to get with a gemini so if you re looking for a girl to be consistent and always caring for you you d be better off courting a different sign virgo she can be submissive and feminine but also dominant and masculine if she s a true gemini she ll have a balance understand how creative and witty she is gemini women are unstoppable when it comes to their quick wit and creativity they ll banter with you do plays on words and whip out their novel or painting that s in the works when you least expect it she likely spends her free time doing something related to music art or literature a gemini girl is the type who can dish it out and also take it she can take a joke if you poke fun at her flirtatiously but you better expect her to have a cutting witty remark to make back at you know that she can be a bit immature there is a side to gemini that is very young childish flighty and immature there almost has to be to balance her almost overly mature serious side however she can t always control when it comes out the younger twin may come out when she s meeting your parents or in the middle of a conference who knows a gemini benefits well from a person who can reign in the more radical sides of her disposition a person who brings out their immaturity could lead to dangerous situations while a person who brings out their darker serious side could lead to no fun it s best if you are well balanced yourself expect to never know what ll happen next if you have this girl around one minute you could be reading poetry on the couch together and the next she s left you a note saying she s on vacation in italy this girl is curious and always looking for the next adventure so when this side comes out it s unstoppable this unpredictability gets to certain people it s easy to mistake it for her not being loving or caring enough when really she does care she just needs to do her own thing what s more she s seeing if you ll be around when she gets back don t expect her to be into make up and magazines most geminis are too smart and too good to value simple girly things like cosmetics and magazines she knows she s naturally beautiful so why bother and when it comes to magazines no thank you she d rather be found reading tolstoy or hemingway that is not to say a gemini isn t feminine she is well at least half of her is she just doesn t see the point of these things society says girls should like and if you talk with her about it you ll likely come away convinced of the same display your intelligence a gemini girl wants someone who can sweep her off her feet physically and mentally she needs to know you can match her when it comes to anything the last thing she wants is a partner that she feel superior over she wants someone she can share the glory with when you re with her talk to her about the book you re reading ask her if she d like to go to a museum mention an article you read the other day about a little known current event she ll find you intriguing and wonder what it is she can learn from you show her you can match her sexually gemini has two sexual sides submissive and dominant you ll see her be coy and subtly flirtatious batting an eyelash here and there and then you ll see her being dominant asking you out and making the moves when this happens roll with the punches let her take charge when she needs to take charge and take over the reigns when she s done she doesn t need someone who s just dominating enough or just submissive enough she needs someone who can handle and complement whichever side she s currently showing let her chat geminis are notoriously very social creatures when their childlike side comes out especially they can be quite the chatterbox when she s off on her tangent or telling you every little detail of the book she s reading sit back and relax allowing her the spotlight watch her go let her entertain you since gemini needs someone who can stimulate her mind ask her questions pose thoughts or theories talk to her about what you re thinking or wondering about you may open her up and get onto an exciting ride ask her out on an interesting or exciting date a gemini loves to be surprised intrigued and entertained as you begin your relationship she ll want to do things that aren t exactly traditional ask her to go make pottery or to go to a cheese tasting she ll be very impressed with your originality and ingenuity don t feel pressured to keep this up all the time she has two sides once you ve shown her that you can handle her more difficult side the curious adventurous one show her that you can relax too in pajamas and with a movie and take out be ready to put in some work a gemini can be emotionally unavailable and difficult to pin down one minute and loving and nurturing the next this sounds a little mentally unstable but it s just the nature of this sign however for their partner this can be a little unnerving you ll have to work at the relationship surviving the times when she s distant and being available when she s ready to return remember this isn t all about you while she is very hesitant to get into a relationship she is by no means unfaithful or unloving half of why she is hard to pin down is because she wants to make sure that when she is it s totally and completely worth it keep her guessing a gemini girl needs to be kept on her toes since she s so full of surprises she wants a partner that can be surprising too tell her you re going out for dinner when really you planned a night at the planetarium bring home a song you wrote for her that you ve been keeping from her it s little things like that a gemini will truly appreciate keep her guessing with your personality too if you re not outdoorsy ask her to go on a hike if you re not huge into music offer to go to the opera if she thinks she can t pin you you ll have her pinned give her her space there s a very independent side to gemini she needs to be left alone at times and given space to find her own adventure don t be unnerved when this happens she s not slipping away from you she s just doing her own thing and there s nothing wrong with that she ll come back raving about all her experiences that she wants to share with you if her independent streak bothers you open up a forum for communication about it she ll love talking to you knowing how you feel and explaining how she feels she ll likely appreciate your concern and try to please you as much as she can be able to handle jealousy the thing about a gemini is that once she s finally decided that she ll commit to you openly she can get pretty jealous she s spent a ton of time deciding if you re worth a serious commitment which is a little scary for her if she feels you slipping away she may not be able to handle it well think of this as a declaration of love and not something that s aggravating all it means is that she cares about you and wants to be sure you re hers do keep in mind though that if you purposefully make her jealous she ll be onto you and she likely won t put up with it know when she needs nurturing and when she needs adventure as you get to know her you ll probably be able to tell which side of her you re dealing with knowing what to expect and handling her swings properly can keep the relationship flowing healthily for a very long time she ll feel safe in your arms this way too simply accepting that these two dynamics of her personality are here to stay is the biggest challenge for any partner of a gemini once you reach that point the rest of the relationship will be smooth sailing,Relationships

how to attract a cancer man,if you have a cancer man in your sights you may be eager to get his attention fortunately there are some things you can do to win his affection and make him more attracted to you,present a traditional feminine aura most cancer men are attracted to women who are highly feminine in a very traditional way subconsciously a cancer male will be looking for a woman who fits his image of the ideal wife and mother everything from your appearance to your mannerisms should ooze femininity slip on a sensual flirty outfit before you approach him like a dress that hugs your curves in all the right places floral perfumes in classic scents like rose can also create the perfect feminine ambiance around you 1 x research source don t try to slip in under the radar as one of the guys skip the dirty jokes and witty jabs instead speak softly and compassionately avoid acting too boyish around him show off your homemaking skills after you get to know him a little take the initiative and show off your ability to keep house in a very traditional manner one of the easiest ways to do this is through cooking cook up a meal or treat for him or invite him over to cook a complex recipe with you keep in mind however that the cancer man is a little more withdrawn and may resist your affections if he believes that you re coming on too fast inviting him back to your place for a meal the first time you meet him will probably end in rejection wait until you have already established some sort of bond with him before you extend an invitation into your home emphasize your love of family you should talk about the love you have for your current family as well as any dreams you have about marrying and starting a family of your own cancer men generally dream of having children someday so it ll help your case dramatically if your dreams are in line with his when talking about your current family focus on the maternal side talk about things you have learned from your mother or time you have recently spent with your mother cancer is a classic mama s boy and if you can show a love for your mother that rivals the love he has for his own you can connect to him more easily in addition to all the mom talk converse with him about pleasant family memories and your childhood connect to the people close to him as long as your cancer man has a functional family he will probably be very close to them the sooner you can get to know his family the sooner you can attract him as a potential mate once again the cancer man tends to be a mama s boy if you can meet his mother and get on her good side you can quickly promote yourself in his eyes if he did not have a good relationship with his family growing up chances are it was not by his choice a cancer man who did not receive the love of family from his actual family will probably view his circle of friends as his family instead in this case your best bet is to get on good terms with his friends focus on his female friends though since getting too cozy with his male buddies might cause him to distrust your affection for him talk about his family in a positive way invite him to talk about his own family and connect other topics of conversation back to his family as often as possible always do so in a positive light though and avoid anything that could sound like an insult toward those he loves for instance if you ve seen his mother and he shares some resemblance with her mention it to him you could also try complimenting the relationship he has with his siblings or remarking on how much you think a certain family member might enjoy the great new band restaurant book movie you re talking about keep a neat organized appearance cancers are neat orderly guys as such they will generally find women who can be equally organized more appealing than those who are complete slobs any space you claim in front of the cancer male should be clean even if you are unable to keep up with his level of tidiness you need to make a good effort at it in other words don t invite him into your personal space if your desk is covered in papers or if your apartment is covered in dirty laundry you do not need to have everything labeled and filed away into neat little packages but some basic cleanliness and a lack of clutter will go a long way ask him to help you organize your space if you do have a cluttered area tell him about it before he finds out on his own by asking him to help you organize it the appeal of this petition is three fold you ll make him feel needed you ll appeal to his natural love of organization and you ll demonstrate a willingness to become less messy and more organized yourself avoid spontaneity the occasional romantic surprise is fine but as a general rule avoid making any sudden wild suggestions or demanding something without any warning cancer guys like to keep all aspects of their life organized this includes both physical space and intangible time ask him for help cancers like to assume the traditional male role of provider and protector give him the chance to provide for you in some way by asking for his help the situation does not need to be anything major but it helps if you choose a task that your cancer dreamboat usually excels at so that he can complete it thoroughly and impressively ask him for help when you move into a new office or apartment or if you go shopping for a new car if nothing quite so dramatic lies ahead of you however look for smaller excuses for example ask his opinion about a dilemma you have at work even if you ve secretly solved the issue yourself satisfy his craving for affection even though cancers like to assume a traditional male role they are also fairly in touch with their emotions they crave love on an emotional level so don t be afraid to shower them with affection the more your actions demonstrate your affection the more likely your cancer man is to respond in kind compliment him offer a kind word about his appearance his skills or the way he makes you feel compliments make your cancer feel good about himself and he can appreciate a woman who gives him the sort of buzz you ll provide whenever you tell him how wonderful he is make sure that your compliments are genuine and subtle though if a cancer man suspects that you are trying to flatter him he might become uncomfortable and start to withdraw from you share your feelings 2 x research source since cancer men tend to be on the emotional side they also have a tendency to feel attracted to women who can be equally expressive in their emotions if not more so plus showing your own willingness to open up can demonstrate how much you want him or need him in your life remember that cancers tend to be insecure the quickest way to establish a sense of emotional security with your cancer crush is to make the first emotional investment try not to contradict him everyone is wrong sometimes and the cancer man is no exception that said since cancers are so emotionally reactive they tend to lash out when directly contradicted or corrected in a harsh manner when you need to correct him be tactful and persuasive rely solely on reason to make your point and try not to get emotional or reactive similarly when he gets angry or upset do not lash back in response wait for him to calm down on his own rather than trying to force him into a calmer state stay within sight oftentimes real attraction is not instantaneous with a cancer man you will need to enter within his field of vision on a fairly regular basis before he comes to appreciate your presence there make the first move cancers tend to be shy so gather up your courage and approach him first the key is to present yourself in a non aggressive way introduce yourself and cement your existence in his mind but never push or pry your way inside his personal bubble especially if he seems uncomfortable you ll need to be assertive but indirectly so persistence is important here show him that you re genuinely interested in him by continually making the effort to approach him a cancer guy can be a little insecure at times but once you calm those insecurities and demonstrate that your interest is real and lasting he can feel comfortable enough to develop his own attraction and affection for you in return never confess your feelings directly dealing with a cancer man can be incredibly complex and may test your patience as someone who likes to assume the traditional male role in a relationship he will probably want to confess his feelings first and may find you less attractive if you jump first on the other hand you have to make your feelings so obviously clear to him that he has very little reason to doubt your attraction to him listen cancer men are usually attracted to women who will share their feelings but you ll be even more attractive if you demonstrate a willingness to really listen to everything he says he needs to open up at his own pace and may do so slowly but if you want to become an attractive person in his eyes you ll need to be a trustworthy presence every step of the way occasionally you should make it a point to demonstrate that you ve been actively listening to him remember his birthday or any other special days he mentions to you if he tells you about something he has going on at work in a few days ask him how it went after the event passes avoid arousing his jealousy you might be tempted to prod his affections along by flirting with other guys but doing so can damage or kill any budding attraction he already has for you cancer men need to feel that they can completely trust their partners if you give him even the slightest reason to doubt this early on he may write you off as a potential mate prepare yourself for his possessiveness once a cancer starts feeling attracted to you he will probably become notably more possessive if you want to nurture his growing attraction you ll need to find ways of coping with his perceived invasion into your personal space if you push him away he will probably stay away for good of course you should always mind your own needs when pursuing a potential relationship even when doing so can chase away the guy you ve set your sights on if his possessiveness becomes dangerous or otherwise unnerving walk away and don t look back even if his possessiveness seems innocent and harmless though you should still take a step back if it makes you feel uncomfortable or unhappy prepare yourself for a long relationship 3 x research source if you re hoping to attract a cancer man for a one night stand you should probably set your sights elsewhere his aversion to wild quick paced actions and his dedication to family make the cancer guy a poor candidate for a fling if you want to attract him in the hopes of starting a long term relationship though you ll probably have much greater success,Relationships
how to keep an aries man interested,so you ve snagged the aries man of your dreams but now you might be wondering what it takes to keep him interested since this zodiac sign tends to crave adventure and have a short attention span the task can be a challenging one but well worth it if you can pull it off,avoid routine simply put an aries man will lose interest the moment his relationship with you becomes too routine or burdensome if you sense yourself falling into a routine with him mix things up to prevent him from getting bored realistically speaking there is no way that every day you spend with him can be completely unlike any other if you see each other on a daily basis though you should try to do something new with him at least once or twice a week to throw off any routine you ve developed keep up with his pace if you haven t realized it already your aries guy tends to like dates full of variety and adventure if you want to keep him interested you need to keep up on the off chance that your aries asks what you would like to do opt for a night on the town instead of a night in if you absolutely must have a night in make it as interesting as possible cook a meal using exotic and unfamiliar ingredients or rent an instructional dvd on latin dance move fast if your relationship is still in an early stage you need to keep the momentum going the aries man is not a fan of taking things slow get ready to make him fall fast or not at all of course you also need to be honest with yourself about how ready you are to advance the relationship he might be ready to take you to bed but if you don t feel likewise don t let his eagerness push you into something you don t want if however you are ready to move forward do so confidently and without hesitation surprise him even though the aries man will usually take the lead he will enjoy a relationship with a woman who can keep him on his toes as well when he least expects it surprise him with something new and exciting if he gets a buzz of energy from being with you he will want to be with you for as long as possible one weekend you could suggest trying something like bungee jumping or rock climbing especially if your aries sweetheart has demonstrated an interest in similar activities in the past you do not need to drag him there blindfolded but simply suggesting the idea can be a nice enough surprise give the gift of experience when you want to give your aries guy a great gift take him out on an adventure instead of buying him something tangible he is far more likely to appreciate the excitement of adventure more than some dull trinket 1 x research source front row seats to watch his favorite sports team or a long weekend camping trip will usually make a better present than something like a new cd let him do his own thing an aries man needs to feel free and independent so he might not always invite you to take part in his latest and greatest adventure try not to hold him back though a clingy woman is a turn off for most aries men try not to be too discouraged if it seems like he would prefer a night out with the guys rather than with you an aries man is not likely to beat around the bush and drop hints that things are over if he loses interest he will be honest about it as such you needn t worry that his sudden interest in hanging out with friends is a subtle indication that things are over between you be easygoing many aries men have a tendency to be extremely bossy and do not appreciate being told what to do in other words you will need to let him take the lead most of the time if you want to have your way in the relationship you need to suggest things in a way that can allow your sweetheart to claim credit for it later resist the temptation to fence him in unfortunately many aries men have wandering eyes they might flirt with other women they meet regardless of whether or not the two of you are an official item this might tempt you to keep him home or latch onto him when you head out but doing so is more likely to drive him away than keep him looking in your direction if his eyes do start to roam skip the direct confrontation and focus on making him look back in your direction instead try making eyes at another guy and letting your aries man catch you doing so his competitive nature will kick in and he will invest his energy back into wooing you challenge him to win your attention if an aries man feels smothered by your attention he may lose interest on the other hand if you challenge him to hold your attention instead of worrying about keeping his he will probably respond to the challenge more than adequately it is important however to let him ultimately win once he accepts the challenge act disinterested at first but once he starts trying to get your focus back on him let him know that his efforts are working stay active overall most aries guys will thrive in a relationship if their partner is active both in and out of the bedroom athletic activities are a good way to bond with him especially if those activities involve some level of challenge engage in a one on one race game of basketball or similarly competitive game keep in mind that aries men hate routine so your physical activities should not adhere to a strict schedule in other words a daily jog after work might not be the best thing to hold his attention mix up the activity and time a little each time match him play for play in terms of physical intimacy the aries man rarely needs much coaxing whether you ve reached the bedroom stage or not you can expect him to put the moves on fast and to heat things up in the blink of any eye you ll need to keep pace with him if you want to avoid boring him for your own sake you might want to stay physically fit otherwise you ll find yourself exhausted well before he wears out be a tease unfortunately the aries man can be a little selfish regarding acts of physical intimacy and quickly takes over if you want to have any say in the experience you may need to act unimpressed from time to time doing so can trigger his love for a good challenge and as a result he may end up paying more attention to you in the pursuit of his conquest hint around this his moves just aren t doing anything for you once he catches on he will be eager to figure out what will and likely won t stop trying new approaches until he reaches his goal don t be afraid to try something new as with all other aspects of his life and aries man needs variety if he wants to try something new in the bedroom let him if he gets nothing but the same old thing with you he might get bored quickly if you are uncomfortable with something though you need to be straightforward and directly tell him to stop once he gets an idea in his head he will go through with it even without direct permission only direct denial will be enough to put the brakes on things support him on his latest and greatest adventure since aries men crave excitement and variety they tend to get involved with more new things than most other guys do he may or may not invite you along for the trip but either way you should let him know that you re cheering for him the entire time this means being involved in other aspects of his life whether they be new business ventures or new hobbies if he welcomes you into the adventure join him confidently if he doesn t show as much interest as possible without pressuring him into inviting you engage in the occasional debate even though your aries man needs to be right he needs to be given the opportunity to prove how right he is in order to feel fully satisfied you can and should challenge him on occasion but keep in mind that you also need to let him win more than lose of course if you feel strongly enough about something you don t need to let him have his way or walk all over you being timid will not go over well nor will letting him win when it s obvious that you have the upper hand never put him down the ego of an average aries man needs tender loving care if you have a habit of embarrassing or correcting him in public you are probably causing a good deal of damage to his sense of self importance and causing his feelings for you to wane as a result making fun of his junior high photos is a definite no no and laughing about a mistake he made with his buddies or families will almost always start a huge fight and lead to seriously hurt feelings in spite of how assertive the aries male can be he s actually rather sensitive and easily hurt coax him with loving words and gestures it is true that most aries guys are impatient and independent but in order to make the relationship last for a long time you need to encourage him to grow emotionally the best way to do so is with obvious tangible gestures of affection deep down he fears rejection and continual reassurance of your acceptance will go a long way don t be afraid of coming on too strong a frequent i love you or i can t wait to see you text is perfectly acceptable as long as he hasn t told you to back off or stop likewise letting him know that he s been on your mind all day will be a major compliment and will usually go over quite well be open if you really want to hold his attention you ll need to be honest with your aries man giving him a challenge from time to time is important but he won t be fond of guessing games so you need to be decisive and confident when called for and honest about what you want when asked 2 x research source now is not the time to get into arguments and expect him to know what you re upset about similarly you should also avoid asking trick questions like the classic does this make me look fat he won t appreciate being backed into a corner even if he knows how to get himself out of it,Relationships

while you cook dinner or turn on a radio show that talks about current events let him see your funny side the typical virgo man is considered serious by nature so he may be drawn to someone who can get him out of his head see how he responds to your sense of humor you should be able to introduce a joke into a situation to lighten the mood 2 x research source as you get to know your man s sense of humor start out with jokes that aren t too edgy or raunchy if raunchy is your sense of humor that s fine and you don t have to change it for him but it s best to feel things out a little before launch into a naughty limerick or off color jokes start with lighthearted observational jokes work on making jokes about the weather that day or make cute puns from time to time pay attention to good manners it s important to always be respectful to others and this may be especially important to a virgo if you notice your virgo is somewhat conservative himself you may find that classic good manners go a long way in attracting a virgo man 3 x research source 4 x research source remember the manners your parents taught you as a child use terms like please thank you and excuse me if you re at a restaurant take extra care to be courteous to the wait staff do not yell or snap when frustrated by the bill or your food if you are a more boisterous loud personality and this seems to offend your conservative partner think about if this is a partnership you really want you shouldn t have to change yourself to be with someone so if the guy would prefer being with someone a little more demure or quiet he s probably not the one for you on the other hand your rambunctious personality may help him loosen up a bit the important thing is to just be yourself while being respectful of others discuss your work ethic notice if your virgo is intense and works hard someone with this personality may be turned off by people he considers lazy or complacent if you also work hard in all your pursuits you and this virgo may be a good match 5 x research source if you have a job for example strive to be the best employee you can pay close attention to small details be on time every day and use downtime to learn more about your company this can be particularly helpful if you re trying to attract a hard worker in your office work hard in other areas keep a neat home and engage in hobbies plan dates around intellectual activities going to a museum or seeing a play would be the ideal date for a virgo man they prefer intellectual conversation so anything that could provoke an interesting discussion would be a great first date for a virgo just make sure it s something you are interested in too browse the cultural enclaves of your location are there any museums or planetariums is there a local theater troupe cater to your individual virgo s taste if he loves art for example take him to a local art museum or art show if he s fascinated by science go see a documentary about evolution together play it somewhat coy the typical virgo is thought to be a little slow to show emotion you may want to try to be subtle in your emotions if your guy has this trait but if you re a naturally emotional affectionate person don t feel pressured to behave in a way you re not comfortable do what feels natural and watch the guy for cues if he s uncomfortable with your level of emotion you may want to dial things back until you get to know each other better when a bond is built a virgo man will enjoy displays of affection but you have to win him over first 6 x research source respect his boundaries if this guy likes to take it slow then you can slow your pace to match his it s important to watch his body language or even ask him outright is this okay some people take longer to decide if they want to be physical or enter a relationship with someone so respect this feeling and take it slow play it cool during communication make sure he knows you re interested by returning texts and phone calls but avoid being too excited go for a response like thanks for inviting me out i look forward to it a more enthusiastic response like i can t wait to see you may put off a virgo man strive for neatness when you re together virgo men tend to veer on the side of perfectionism and may be turned off by messy partners if you are a neat and tidy person who pays attention to the details then you and this virgo may be well matched however if organization and tidiness is not your style he may not be the one for you make sure your clothing is clean do not wear anything with stains or holes if you have cats or dogs make sure to run a lint roller over your clothes prior to going out you want to make sure you remove any loose hairs when out to eat eat slowly and avoid slurping or spilling your food keep your napkin on your lap at all times if you invite your virgo man over keep your place clean a virgo may be turned off by a floor that needs sweeping or a sink full of dirty dishes discuss your values while your virgo may perfectly fit the description of his sign you still should not make assumptions about what is important to him or what his values are as with any partnership take the time to find out what is important to your man in a relationship and decide if they fit with what is important to you too you may find you disagree on major points such as having children or have very different communication styles be direct and honest about what you both want from a relationship for instance it would be a mistake to assume that he wants a lot of alone time simply because he is an intense virgo man you can ask him are you someone who needs a lot of me time will you let me know when you feel you need a little space you may find that he actually prefers to be around people most of the time contrary to the typical virgo have patience virgo men may be deep thinkers and may take awhile to make a decision about a partner if you re looking for a whirlwind romance you might not get that from a virgo man it may take him awhile to commit so strive for patience in the relationship 7 x research source do not pressure your virgo man for a commitment early on do not get impatient while the wait can be frustrating remember that virgo men are kind loving and loyal you will have an extremely kind caring significant other if you allow a virgo man to come to you allow him to pursue his own work if your virgo is passionate about his hobbies or work it may be important for you both to be good at doing things independently and having a little me time virgo men do not do anything halfway and a virgo man is sure to put his all into any pursuits 8 x research source a virgo man may be very dedicated to work allow him to do his job without interference if your virgo man has hobbies expect him to take them seriously try to support his passions for example your virgo man may be on a sports team show up to his games and cheer him on even if sports aren t really your thing it s nice to go and show support be kind and loyal if your man is a typical virgo he will be very dedicated to his partner and he will expect as much in return virgo men also have very little patience for unnecessary drama be loyal to your virgo man and not to bait him into unnecessary arguments while you should never put aside your own feelings try to avoid argument if your virgo man upsets you approach him in a calm kind fashion say something like could i talk to you about something that bothered me i just want to make sure we talk it out so it doesn t affect our relationship accept his intensity you can expect a virgo man to be intense this is just his nature and it is unlikely to change a virgo man tends to take everything seriously including your relationship once he s ready to commit he will be intense about the commitment this can be a good thing as you ll have a loving and loyal partner but he will also be intense about work school and hobbies you need to accept this to be with a virgo 9 x research source allow your virgo man the time he needs to pursue his passions he may get very serious about matters that seem silly to you but try to accept this it is just in his nature if you aren t interested in the same things take that time to pursue your own passions remember his intensity will ultimately benefit you you want a partner who s intense about you as this will spell out a longterm commitment,Relationships

how to date a capricorn woman,born from the 21st of december to the 20th of january capricorns are all about ambition leadership personal drive and directness however when it comes to dating a capricorn woman things aren t quite so simple in addition to the qualities above capricorns can be gentle sensitive and caring thus dating a capricorn woman can be a tricky prospect that requires care effort and attention but it can also be immensely rewarding capricorns make good life long partners 1 x research source,engage her about her work or personal projects capricorns are naturally ambitious hard working people most will enjoy discussing their professional goals and the progress they ve made toward them try talking to her about whatever she s doing to get ahead in life whether this includes a nine to five job or personal projects like art writing etc and don t be surprised if she s ready to talk about these things at great length work may be a topic that you find boring but don t have to sound like you re asking her robotic questions at a job interview when you talk to her about hers in fact with some creativity and an air of gentle mischief you can add a little flirty zest to these normally dry questions here are just a few examples bland questions where do you work what do you do do you enjoy that where do you see yourself in five years zesty questions so what s your plan for making your first million what s your next step in life are you more of a gordon gekko person or a lorenzo anello person subtly bring up your own professional achievements because they value ambition and determination most capricorns respect someone who s worked hard and achieved big successes however capricorns are modest and conservative at heart so they re unlikely to respond well to extravagant boasting instead try dropping subtle hints about your accomplishments by working them into the conversation naturally see below for a few examples blunt brags you see these shoes these are real alligator skin we should go cruising in my new bugatti this weekend i just won employee of the month at my dad s real estate business for the fifth time in a row subtle sweet talking i m hoping to use my signing bonus to do something nice for us i only wear this watch on special occasions i bought it for myself when i got my master s i don t usually do this but i like to enjoy something nice after things go well at work play to her sense of competition gently capricorns aren t generally people who will shy from a little friendly sparring planning dates that involve some degree of competition can lead to great fun and some serious romantic sparks however intense heated competition is a no no too much competition can lead to resentment and in addition capricorns aren t likely to enjoy the embarrassment of losing at a high stakes game good date ideas bowling cards mini golf shooting archery arcade games board games with drinks bad date ideas street racing one on one street rules basketball high stakes poker if you re dominating at your competition it may be a good idea to let your date win at least once at whatever you re doing to prevent embarrassment try not to make it too obvious that you re letting her win this can be more embarrassing than losing in the first place give her thoughtful gifts that she s likely to use most capricorns are practical people that are likely to appreciate a gift a little more for its value and usefulness than for its symbolic meaning while a piece of jewelry or a bouquet of some fragrant flowers is almost always a sweet gesture you ll want some of your gifts to be a little more down to earth try to get her things she ll get continued long lasting use and enjoyment out of rather than one time thrills the ideal practical gift for a capricorn woman depends on her personal hobbies and interests for instance if she enjoys drawing try getting her a high quality sketch pad and a set of professional pencils if she s a natural born athlete get her a membership to an exclusive gym with the finest exercise equipment there s no right answer here it all depends on the woman occasionally treat her to high status outings while capricorns are unlikely to appreciate gaudy ostentatious displays of wealth they are naturally status conscious and will enjoy sampling the finer things in life every once in a while 3 x research source to celebrate special occasions and sometimes just because make an effort to treat your capricorn lover to a fancy time out good date ideas museums operas fancy restaurants film festivals art shows weekend getaways wineries etc short on cash it s possible to enjoy the finer things in life on the cheap if you re creative for instance try checking a local university s events website it will usually be possible to see traveling speakers attend book signings and more for very cheap or even free agree about your long term goals early on one of the biggest hazards to a successful relationship with a capricorn woman is that if your goals don t seem compatible she ll probably simply move on save yourself the pain of having this difficult conversation after a years long relationship by double checking your long term goals for compatibility within the first six months of your relationship or so questions that you ll want to be able to answer include do either of you plan on getting married in your lifetime do either of you want kids do either of you want pets when do you want to settle down how much would you like to save and how much would you like to spend what major purchases would you like to make how do you plan on living your life give her the freedom to have some say in your plans no couple s long term plans align perfectly some amount of compromise is necessary for a long term relationship to work when the time comes to start talking about which specific compromises you intend to make be sure to make her an equal partner in the decision making not only is this common courtesy it s also a smart move for long term happiness your partner is much more likely to respect your desires if you re willing to sacrifice things so that she can achieve hers let her determine the pace of the relationship unless you re a capricorn yourself or you have a temperament like one there s a very good chance that your female capricorn lover will take a longer time to warm up to additional commitments in your relationship than you will let her take her time an initial reluctance to dive head first into a new relationship isn t likely a reflection of her feelings toward you personally it s a result of her naturally cautious deliberate approach to life s decisions give her time to open up to you and you ll be glad you waited treat her with respect this may seem like a no brainer but it s worth mentioning because this tends to be more important for a capricorn woman than it does for the average woman as noted above capricorn women are somewhat status conscious this means that they tend to notice when they re treated in ways that diminish their status and that they may get embarrassed about certain breaches of etiquette that other women might not even notice be respectful to your capricorn lover this doesn t mean that you have to be deathly serious around her but it does mean that you ll want to act differently around her than you would around your closest friends things to consider include the language you use around her especially with regards to crude words etc the way you speak about her in public the way you talk to your friends about her the minor courtesies you show her holding her hand to help her up a step giving her your coat when it s cold etc don t be put off by her guardedness as noted above capricorns tend to be traditional business minded somewhat conservative people this can lead them to seem standoffish or even cold at first understand that at the heart of every capricorn there s a person who s capable of deep emotion and compassion while the average capricorn may not be as open about her emotions as for instance the average leo she is still plenty capable of forming strong emotional bonds given enough time avoid coming across as needy or desperate capricorns pride themselves on not relying very heavily on others to achieve their goals since your capricorn partner is likely to be an independent driven soul don t drag her down by constantly bombarding her with pleas for attention and affection instead cherish the tender moments you do share as these are sure to be genuine and unforced in addition be ready and willing to periodically entertain yourself capricorns won t die if they don t get to see you for a single day so you shouldn t either behaviors you ll want to avoid calling or texting many times per day frequently asking for confirmations of her affection acting jealously attempting to alter her schedule avoid coming across as lazy or unmotivated few things are less attractive to a capricorn than someone who refuses to at least try to solve their own problems don t let your capricorn lover ever start to see you as a bum try to maintain ambitious professional goals even if you can t achieve all of them similarly don t take your relationship for granted always show your partner that she s important to you make a sincere effort to put in hard work in your professional and personal life and she will value you for your efforts sometimes life deals difficult hands that force us to become less active than we previously were for instance illnesses family problems and unexpected layoffs may temporarily force you to take a less active role in achieving your goals in these cases don t give in to feelings of inadequacy a smart capricorn woman will be able to tell the difference between someone who won t work hard for their goals and someone who is temporarily prevented from doing so conversely avoid showy displays of dominance with their independent minded personalities capricorns do not like being controlled by their significant other or having this sort of one sided relationship implied in any way take a hands off approach to your partner s life she should be free to make her own decisions and form her own opinions above all she is not someone to be possessed controlled or otherwise trifled with be prepared to respect your capricorn lover s independence or risk losing her behaviors you ll want to avoid speaking for your partner at social events apologizing for her opinions when they differ from yours violating her privacy or personal space trying to control her behaviors etc don t expect her to fix any deep rooted problems you have for better or for worse capricorns focus most of all on their own problems not their partner s while a good capricorn woman will always be willing to offer compassionate words of support and a loving shoulder to cry on during difficult times they generally won t be satisfied in a relationship where they re expected to spend all of their excess energies helping you capricorns expect their partners to be self reliant and to get the help they need when they are truly in trouble so that it doesn t begin to affect the relationship problems you won t want to unload on your partner depression substance abuse issues stress from family conflicts workplace stress mental health issues risky behaviors poor self control difficulties from previous relationships etc,Relationships

them express themselves fully 5 x research source be prepared for a social life but expect some quiet moments too geminis are social butterflies by nature but sometimes they like to stay at home too don t get used to them always wanting to party and don t hold them back if they just want to stay at home and watch movies if you are introverted or anti social by nature be up front about this try to figure out some sort of compromise an example of a compromise would be going to a smaller party which would be less stressful to you but still appeal to the gemini another example of a compromise would be going to a party one weekend and staying in the next you can also try to slowly introduce yourself to the gemini s social circle for example you can start off with smaller parties and less crowded situations and build your way up to larger wilder events don t force a gemini to make decisions when he or she becomes indecisive duality is a major aspect of geminis because of this they

gemini asks for it don t get used to anything a gemini says does or wants geminis are known for being full of contradictions they are also known for being spontaneous and wanting to try new things their personalities are also multidimensional just because the gemini you are dating likes the outdoors does not mean that he or she will always want to go hiking there might be a time when he or she just wants to stay home when the gemini you are dating wants to try something different go for it don t try to force the old way upon them instead embrace the change 9 x research source at the same time if the gemini you are dating is suddenly upset or unhappy it would always be a good idea to ask what is wrong instead of simply accepting it as the new norm don t get upset if a gemini changes his or her mind suddenly and cancels or changes a plan being represented by the twins geminis have fickle ever changing minds they can change and cancel plans last minute do not take this the wrong way it is likely not personal instead try to accept it as part of the gemini s ever changing nature if this really bothers you however talk to the gemini about it do not accuse him or her of always flaking instead explain that you take plans seriously and that it hurts you when they are suddenly changed 10 x research source,Relationships

don t want to waste time fooling around they need to know before they get into anything that it ll be worth their while so show them you re interested you re in it to win it and that you re willing to wait be direct sometimes capricorn is so enveloped in their career or something else going on in their lives that even the most obvious of flirtations can be lost you might feel as if you ve been waiting on their doorstep coquettishly for weeks when you finally ask them out and they seem taken aback it s because they didn t see you coming if the ball needs propulsion you may have to do it yourself make them feel secure capricorns aren t ones for spontaneous actions if they know it s coming they ll embrace it so plan out your date and show them you ve put thought into your offer if you

and almost always serious to give them the change of pace they desperately want but can t seem to find make them laugh even though they don t seem to be about humor themselves it doesn t mean they don t crave it just about anytime and anywhere and anyhow is a good way to go about it the only thing to keep in mind is not to poke fun at them too much if you re not close sometimes cap doesn t pick up on when people are being playfully obnoxious dress well since capricorn is so ambitious they constantly are striving toward something a bit better than their current state to match this drive in them always show up to the occasion dressed well if you re dressing like you ve spent the last 72 hours in your mom s basement eating only pop tarts and playing the sims mr or ms cappy won t be having it capricorn at least on the outside seems to be into appearances it can be misconstrued as being shallow and vain but in reality they just like nice things they like working for everything so it s the reward they deserve be subtle in public capricorn is traditional and serious in most situations at least initially if you two are out and about don t expect him her to be hanging off of you and don t hang off them either the place for that is at home capricorn also responds better to knowing looks than to playful touches while being physically affectionate is fine there are more effective ways to work your way into their heads master meaningful eye contact and you re in don t give up on seducing them you know how we talked about cappy being serious and stoic yeah makes for a tough time getting them in the bedroom you might be on your 6th date and you wind up with a gentle peck on the lips and a cab ride home don t be dissuaded things that come too easy aren t worth it remember a lack of sexual contact initially does not mean they re not interested you just have to weasel your way in to get to the good stuff they re not going to give it away for free you know and when you do get in there it will be way more than you expected get traditional generally speaking capricorn views dating in a very traditional sense in the beginning you may go to dinner and a movie half a dozen times before he she suggests something else while this has its drawbacks it has its advantages too you ll experience a traditional courtship that can be very fulfilling and fun some men will insist on paying the bill some women will want the door opened for them etc this will go away as the cappy gets more comfortable but will always be resonant in the smaller ways understand their lack of emotion more erratic and unstable signs aren t good matches for capricorn they are patient serious and often unmoved if you don t understand that this is just how they are it ll make for a very difficult relationship it has nothing to do with you or how they feel about you it s just how they operate and see the world it s easy to mistake the capricorn as melancholy while this is obviously a feeling they re capable of it s not necessarily so when you detect it they re just in their brains figuring out the best plan to action weighing out logic and rationale and devising a plan help them maintain their image capricorn does not have time for someone who s really just an obstacle in their way to success if you re a deterrent to what they want to achieve you ll be ousted help them rise to the top like they re inclined to do and you ll be a necessary part of the action a huge part of this is simply understanding that their motivation and ambition is an integral part of their personality encouraging their laziness or enabling them to slack off is not what they re looking for in a partner get over those trust walls you ve probably picked up on the fact that capricorns aren t easy to get to know they re not into displays of emotion and they can seem pretty uninterested and stoic at first glance but this goes away one day a light bulb will turn on and you ll wonder where your dream goat went only to get replaced by someone who s even more incredible at some point in your relationship it ll click once they ve determined that you re the real deal that you ll be around for the long haul that you re worth being let in you re golden for forever they re yours to keep be ambitious as if it wasn t already crystal clear capricorn has drive and is determined though they say opposites attract this is not one of those times those who are laid back need not apply cappy needs someone who can fuel their drive not question why they re trying so hard if you have it going on too they ll be all that much more motivated capricorn isn t looking for someone who s only focused on their relationship if you re getting into deep waters with yours be sure to keep an eye on your career your friends and your hobbies you shouldn t lose yourself and your dreams it s what capricorn was drawn to in the first place be stable the one who s temperamental mercurial and erratic will not be a good fit for patient rational capricorn if you re quick to anger or tears capricorn just straight up won t get you and will get exhausted be stable mentally and cappy will know who they can lean on those with addictive or insecure personalities don t really have a place in capricorn s world if you re boozing away the weekends or spending days wrapped up in a pity party capricorn will not be having it they desperately want life to be on an even keel at all times why do you think they plan everything out ahead of time be classy if you re poised and classy capricorn will see you as a boost to their

because of their extensive planning that they can be so firm in their convictions since they ve weighed everything out or they think that they have they see no need to budge so if you can do the budging for them the both of you will be better off be patient this will come in handy for two reasons 1 since your cappy is so patient being frazzled is something they won t tolerate and 2 they

how to date an aquarius male,you ve found a man who s ruled by the sign of aquarius huh he s probably super creative dynamic and marching to the beat of his own drum no wonder you re falling for him want to get a grip on his intriguing personality and see if you can ride the wind with him here s the rundown on those born between january 20 and february 18 aquarius the water bearer,be friends first aquarians aren t interested in the one trick pony that s obviously trying to get with them they want something more interesting something more dynamic going all out in one fell swoop isn t enough take it slow show them you re worth the time and be friends first your aim is to be the friend that stands out aquarians not to be confused with aquariums want something special something that can captivate them they know better than to judge a book by its cover so they ll need to read you first let them get absorbed in your pages value his mind the aquarian is the one you find who s spilling with creativity whether he s behind a camera or a paintbrush he s full of vision and drive his entire life is outside the proverbial box and he s often on a different wavelength than others if you show him that you get this that you get it and you appreciate it you ll be leagues above the others who are just smiling and nodding away at him he ll love it ask him questions get curious about what he s up to is he writing a song turning his basement into a veritable spy facility painting a mural on the side of the school be interested and if you can add your skills into the equation too all the better show your intellect this is by far the greatest aphrodisiac for the aquarian there s nothing like a lively chat rich in culture and future possibilities to get this sign going he knows he s got it going on upstairs he wants someone else to talk to who s got it going on too aquarians are just about interested in everything so don t worry about what you can talk about to impress him whatever you re passionate about should be what you engage him on he ll love seeing your zest for life appeal to his eccentric side since he feels a bit different than everyone else sometimes he can feel a little abnormal show him that his eccentric side is something you love and it s something you can even relate to be unusual be original do your own thing how else will you stand out when it comes to you do your own thing wear whatever clothes you feel like act on a whim don t be afraid to be too loud or too reserved or too different who wants to be vanilla anyway don t come on too strong aquarius craves freedom and independence if you come on too strong he ll be gone like the wind he s not into emotions and getting too clingy desperate intense is not appealing to any of his sensibilities that s part of the reason being friends first is so important let him know that you are cool and casual be a little detached nothing is a big deal with you that lack of stress and drama is something aquarians definitely are attracted to that way when he does ask you out he knows you won t freak out one way or another have a fun not super serious relationship in mind in general it s pretty hard to tie an aquarius down at least initially they don t like talking about labels or being boxed in to anything if you take is slow and don t put pressure on the relationship it ll last much much longer your relationship at least in the beginning stages is all about enjoying each other and having fun and there is nothing wrong with that if you want to go to the chapel after 5 dates calm it down there can be time for that later keep the surprises coming since aquarius is curious about everything they love surprises they love learning they love experience they love doing they love living to the fullest a spicy fulfilling relationship to them is one that keeps their brains running wondering what s around the corner so surprise them don t be afraid to go for the shock factor it s almost impossible to shock an aquarius so make it a personal challenge to do so suggest doing some crazy things chocolate covered grasshoppers anyone talk about everything aquarians in general are open books they have no qualms when it comes to talking about even the most taboo of topics engage them in politics current events morals and ethics whatever it is they ll take it and run with it the more things you re capable of talking about together the better don t worry about offending their principles they love hearing others opinions even if they don t agree with their own so long as you have an opinion and a reason to stand behind it they ll respect what you have to say as far as the signs go they re one of the best most diplomatic arguers and conversationalists get creative together you know how we talked about aquarius creativity do it together while you should definitely have separate hobbies do spend some of your free time combining powers whether it s pottery designing a website or planning a trip your relationship will be that much sturdier when you have projects to work on one of the benefits of dating an aquarius they can teach you if you don t know thing one about photography playing the piano or whatever it is your aquarius does well have him show you the ropes you ll stand on your own two feet eventually but in the meantime let him wrap his arms around you while you both click the buttons or pound the ivories use reason and logic not emotion aquarius is a sign that resonates strongest in the brain his heart is not something he uses often or at least willingly if you want to relate to him use reason and logic don t use tears guilt or any other feeling to get your way it won t work but a sound argument just might if you re having a fight explain how you re feeling in the most reasonable of terms remove yourself from you for a bit and take a more objective stance instead of saying oh my gosh why did you use the last of the toilet paper and not tell me say i was very inconvenienced by not having any toilet paper and could ve avoided the situation if you had told me he ll respond much more promptly know that he can be avoidant so here s the thing about aquarius since they re not really keen on emotions they re susceptible to freaking out when they get them so if your man starts being a bit avoidant or anxious it actually could be because his feelings are getting too strong when this happens remember this fact or the relationship will fall apart very quickly the only thing you can really do is to talk about it don t jump to any conclusions and be as tactful as possible a simple hey i ve noticed a change in your behavior recently might be enough for him to fess up and definitely don t freak out yourself know that he is an air sign you don t have to do a lot of math to figure out what this means aquarius is like the wind flowing free there one minute gone the next sometimes fierce sometimes gentle but always doing its own thing in order to be compatible with mr water bearer you gotta let him have his independence this by no means he won t be faithful or loyal that has nothing to do with it it simply means that he needs to feel that he s his own person and is free to do as he pleases trust that as he pleases is the behavior of a good boyfriend be yourself sometimes you d swear your aquarius alter ego was holden caulfield he absolutely can t stand phonies he can see right through you if you start self presenting and image maintaining so don t do it relax know that yourself is all he wants be honest at all times honesty and sincerity are essential for anyone seeking a long term connection to this dynamic personality when it comes to love people best suited are those that are not thrown off by aquarian frankness and honesty open communicative imaginative and willing to risk are all qualities that blend well with this sign s perspective on life don t get too emotionally charged mr aqua doesn t do well with intense dramatics if you run around with your hands in the air crying muttering nonsense between gulps of tears he ll go sit down on the couch and turn on the tv it s not that he doesn t care about you it s that he doesn t care for theatrics on the same token he probably won t display emotion on a grand scale either both positive and negative so when you think he ll be super excited about something know that he just may be somewhere deep inside he s just not showing it be open minded your man is totally open to all walks of life all opinions and all philosophies he s not a fence sitter or a people pleaser he just sees it all it d serve you well to be open minded too at least for those times when he sits down to dinner with a raging ist and isn t giving them the third degree you ll also need to be open to all his eccentricities where most people may find them strange your open mindedness will find them endearing you realize that there is no normal but there is unique and original too very wonderful qualities go with the flow a relationship with an aquarius can be interesting indeed since you re not putting too much pressure on them it s important to just hang tight and see where it goes let the breeze take you wherever it goes when he wants to be serious you ll know and you can decide if you want to be serious then too some people find it difficult to allow the other person this sense of control don t think of it like this you re simply enjoying yourself you both are why would that need to end don t worry about the long term he s not after all you only have today so live it up have fun and have fun with your dynamic fascinating intriguing water bearer,Relationships

to impress you argue your points if you happen to disagree with something they say say so be provocative by challenging what they believe keep it friendly though frame your arguments by saying well i believe or i just think instead of stoking their competitive streak too much by flat out declaring you re wrong create an air of intimacy scorpios crave real connections and strong chemistry so improve your chances by making each moment about the two of you and no one else either plan ahead to have a one on one encounter or draw them into a private corner if you find yourselves at larger

communicate physically let your body do the talking especially whenever you have to fall back on small talk to flirt with them in the beginning lock eyes with them and don t let go stand a step closer to them than you would with anybody else touch their hand to draw their attention or emphasize a point that you re making anticipate their needs show how tuned you are to them by helping them out before they even think to ask if you re sharing a pitcher and you see that they ve almost finished their glass pour them another drink if you notice that they seem to feel too hot or too cold ask them if they want to relocate to somewhere more comfortable scorpios respond to chemistry and nothing says chemistry better than knowing what the other person wants before they do refrain from comparing them to anybody else if they strike you as being exactly like your best friend from school years ago stay mum on the subject if they make a comment that you heard someone else make just the other day zip your lips maintain the air of intimacy by keeping the focus on the two of you without bringing anyone else into the conversation even if the comparison is favorable resist prying scorpios have a tough time sharing their inner private lives so don t scare them off by coming across as someone who likes to snoop or blab 4 x research source since they love to be in control simply follow their line of conversation steer clear of topics that they might consider taboo or otherwise find uncomfortable if they receive a phone call or text or if a friend of theirs walks up and whispers in their ear leave it unmentioned 5 x expert source jessica lanyadoo astrologer psychic medium expert interview 12 november 2019 keep negative comments to yourself avoid speaking ill of others especially if they re family or friends even if you have a valid complaint about your sister or a buddy remember that your scorpio will wonder why you shared it with them avoid leaving the impression that you re just as likely to speak negatively of them behind their back too concede some control expect your scorpio to want to dictate their own lives and to an extent yours adapt yourself as best as you can to their vision of how things should be as you both share your wants needs and dreams judge theirs versus your own to see if they re compatible the less compatible they are the more likely that you should probably end things rather than waste time by asking them to change for you 6 x research source talk about the future ask them what their goals in life are where do they want to live what do they want to do for a career etc compare them with your own if the two of you can each accomplish your respective five year plans without any great sacrifice you re good to go but if you want to open a bakery in your hometown while they want to jet all over the globe as an archaeologist it s probably best to walk away now because they re not going to settle talk about their expectations of you scorpios like to dictate the nature of their relationships as well as everything else 7 x research source suss out what they expect out of you as a partner if you fit their idea of an ideal mate congrats if the person they describe doesn t sound a thing like you call it quits because they will probably expect you to be this person regardless stand your ground when needed although you ll have to adapt a bit in order to make things work don t be afraid to draw lines adapt where you re willing to but stay true to yourself when their demands are too much earn their respect by refusing to be a pushover while ensuring that they treat you how you wish to be treated maintain trust scorpios have a lot of issues regarding trust so make earning and keeping their trust a top priority at the same time accept that they will probably never share everything with you respect their right to keep some private matters to themselves while proving to them that they re safe in sharing everything else with you 8 x research source resist snooping stay out of their sock drawer leave their cellphones and other devices alone unless they invite you to use them even then refrain from checking their

anyone else even if you have zero interest in someone who decides to hit on you don t engage or otherwise humor them your scorpio might misinterpret being polite with being interested also say goodbye to your exes if you re still on good terms with them wish them the best in life but let them know it s time for you to move on for good 10 x research source keep their sense of adventure alive remember scorpios love the thrill of the chase so now that they ve caught you they need something new to chase after avoid falling into predictable routines stimulate their love of life and pursuit conquer new challenges together propose new activities for the both of you to do go wall or rock climbing find a local polar bear swim and take a midwinter dive into icy waters try skydiving whatever you choose it doesn t need to be death defying or a lifelong pursuit just something new and exciting explore intellectual pursuits as a couple join an art program and learn how to paint or sculpt

in a serious romance or a more casual fling let them know what you want in no uncertain terms although scorpios are eager to meet their soulmate they will often accept chemistry as they find it

they turn off if they seem to lose interest after the first date or two or fail to respond to your signals to begin with they may have genuinely lost interest or they may be so interested that they ve backed off to rethink their strategy especially if you re already friends with a risk of losing you altogether if things don t work out if it s the former accept it because there s not much you can do to change their mind 12 x research source if it s the latter assure them that you really do want to move forward weather the storm scorpios are prone to mood swings so brace yourself when something s wrong expect them to fly off the handle one minute and freeze you out the next stay calm and collected because what they need is someone who s more grounded avoid mirroring their behavior and making things worse pursue their silences when they shut you out gently probe for the reason why scorpios expect such a strong connection between the two of you they think you should be able to figure out what s wrong on your own if you have no idea what s up ask them what s wrong the longer you let silences grow the more they might resent your inability to suss out what s wrong on top of whatever was bothering them in the first place keep calm when they rage out bite your tongue you don t have to accept what they say or let them win the fight but ensure that you ll be heard by remaining calm avoid being drawn into a screaming match and escalating the situation let them get it all out and then reply with calm measured responses know when to call it quits scorpios love to be in control and tend to be jealous and possessive 13 x research source if this causes them to cross a line call them out on it the best ones may be conscious of their behavior and admit when they re unreasonable if not walk away if these qualities are too much for you to handle because your scorpio isn t likely to change any time soon at their worst scorpios may become physically and or verbally abusive in their quest for control pay attention to how they treat you when you fight or disagree if they handle you roughly beyond a playful manner insult you or ignore your hurt feelings take it as a warning sign

to apply a critical eye toward you right from the get go don t be offended by this since she is considering you as a potential partner this means she might still think highly of you as a person even if she doesn t initially believe you to be right for her romantically dress carefully notice if appearance seems to be important to this woman is her clothing immaculately tailored are her friends

apply the same critical eye to herself 8 x research source obviously ask about her life work school friends family dreams etc when appropriate to indicate your interest in her pay attention however to how comfortable she seems in answering back off when she becomes awkward nervous or edgy about certain topics because of their self critical nature virgos may often feel uncomfortable when they are the center of attention if she is reluctant to share too much information about herself right away stick to more general topics such as world news or movies or music keep the conversation light and organic to prevent it from resembling a formal interrogation 9 x research source keep yourself at ease too resist the urge to appear flawless in her eyes it can be hard to resist the urge to present yourself as the perfect person or to try and change yourself to appeal to what you think she wants but this rarely works out be yourself and see if you match up although virgos hope to find a perfect fit romantically remember that they expect the fit to be perfect not you personally keep in mind that she may be looking for a partner whose strengths make up for her weaknesses and so she may not be too concerned if your strengths don t match all of hers 10 x research source 11 x research source focus on creating a strong honest first impression rather than an idealized one that would be impossible to live up to aim to show her exactly who you are instead of what you think she wants you to be talk about a wide array of topics remember that virgos are very pragmatic in their assessment of potential partners expect her to not only wonder how well the two of you will get along but how well you could integrate into her larger life unless she seems bored or irritated don t be shy of steering the conversation toward interests that she doesn t share even if she personally dislikes say punk rock trust that she will view your passion for it as a plus 12 x research source be patient although virgos may harbor inner passions expect them to act reserved around new people don t be discouraged by a lack of immediate sparks 13 x research source for now simply aim to win a second date with her accept that as a victory in and of itself while allowing her plenty of time to grow more comfortable with you challenge her false impressions give your virgo the benefit of the doubt and assume that she is aware of her tendency to judge people too quickly trust that she is open to reconsidering them when proven wrong 14 x research source if you feel like she has misunderstood a statement of yours reopen the conversation and clarify your meaning if she has misinterpreted your actions explain exactly why you acted as you did for example say she has concluded that you have poor manners because you didn t hold the door open for her joke about how you are unsure of what is still considered chivalrous and what is now thought to be outmoded and belittling in the modern world of dating engage her brain understand that virgos tend to be very knowledgeable stimulate her mind by always keeping the conversation alive embrace discussions on any number of subjects challenge her points of view when you disagree 15 x research source don t worry about being an expert on each and every topic your openness to discuss topics that you never pondered before should impress her just as much as your thorough knowledge on a subject if not more so have a thick skin resist the urge to feel offended by her blunt statements appreciate that her practical mind often compels her to speak directly without mincing words regard her criticisms opinions and advice as simple statements of what she thinks rather than a personal attack 16 x research source past instances of offending people have probably clued her into this tendency of hers so trust that all you have to do is softly point out that you would appreciate a different choice of words in the future be sensitive to her feelings remember that no one receives the brunt of her critical eye as much as she does expect her to over analyze your relationship and worry over her own faults whether or not you even consider them to be a problem anticipate that her expectations of herself may lead to pronounced mood swings at times depending on how well she thinks she s living up to her standards 17 x research source 18 x research source encourage her to talk openly about her feelings which she may hide in the beginning assure her when her worries are baseless or resolvable couch your own criticisms gently since she may take them too much to heart share her with her other commitments expect your virgo to strive to be perfect in other areas of her life too accept that she will divide her time between you and other obligations such as work friends and family understand that this balancing act may in fact appear quite imbalanced at times 19 x research source when it appears to be against you trust that her pragmatic mind has made a logical decision about what needs more attention this minute rather than take it as a personal slight judge her by her actions not words appreciate that your virgo s passions will rarely erupt into fiery pronouncements of undying devotion remember that she is more likely to think in terms of practicality rather than poetry expect her to demonstrate her love with small consistent acts of caring rest assured that her gestures however moderate indicate a sincere love and desire for stability 20 x research source for example though you might be feeling neglected after her fifth night of working late in a row appreciate her effort to say fix you breakfast or a cup of coffee before she leaves in the morning be ready to plan ahead don t be surprised if your meticulous virgo likes to map out the next several years in advance expect her to have ambitions as well as clear strategies of how to achieve them either share your own early on so that you can formulate a plan together for shared success or be very very flexible in where you d like to see yourself in the future 21 x research source remember that she may not necessarily be looking for a partner with the exact same qualities as her so don t be overwhelmed if you are more of a spontaneous type who prefers seizing the moment this may be a trait that she envies 22 x research source tread cautiously at first no matter what the person s sign never make assumptions about what she wants based on that alone instead of trying to guess what she is comfortable with have a candid conversation about sexual preferences if the woman is a reserved virgo you may not be getting physical until later in the relationship but once that is on the table it is important you have this talk even if she is shy avoid ruining your chances by forcing a physical relationship before she is ready bear in mind that virgos are typically more interested in your potential as a long term partner rather than a quick fling 23 x research source consider making the first move if you are both open to it you may want to initiate physical intimacy with a virgo improve your chances by waiting for a private moment since virgos may be reluctant to display too much affection in front of others plan ahead take a page from your virgo and be meticulous in your planning make an event of it with plenty of build up such as a fine bottle of wine a bouquet of flowers or rose petals on the bed or couch dimmed lights and lighted candles 24 x research source take some of the uncertainty out of the equation by announcing your intentions without backing her into a corner at the same time demonstrate your confidence to her by setting the stage for your hoped for outcome if she chooses not to be physical respect that and back off don t try to talk her into it or convince her otherwise be supportive remember that virgos criticize themselves more than anyone if she does something that turns you off resist the urge to chastise her for it which might cause her to lose confidence and retreat instead of telling her to not do something encourage her to do something else continue to show your enthusiasm in order to assure her that you re into it be patient and trust her inherent desire to perfect her skills in all areas of life 25 x research source vocalize your desires to take things to the next level or spice things up tell her what you re thinking don t mistake her hesitancy for a lack of desire or adventure instead appreciate that it takes virgos some time to grow completely comfortable with a partner share your fantasies to probe her own chances are that if she shares them she will be more than willing to raise your game 26 x research source,Relationships

a guy be aware that she might have to take more time than normal before she is ready to kiss you this doesn t mean they re not into you it just means they need to be drawn out of their shell never ask them out in public as this will make them feel nervous ask them out in private invite them on a casual yet fun date nothing with too much pressure or too many stigmas just because someone is a cancer doesn t mean they can t have fun try taking them to the beach or swimming pool since this is a water sign don t bother with games cancers are super intuitive when it comes to people and their motivations so don t waste your time playing hard to get cat and mouse or any other variety of mind game they ll see right through you and know you re not being genuine cancers if they feel comfortable will be direct with you they need you to be direct with them too if you re presenting an image around them or trying to be mysterious they will not be having it they re super good at reading people so don t even think about hiding your emotions make them feel at home cancers are huge on family and feeling at home generally they prefer staying at their home but if you can make them

are a family man woman they ll take solace in knowing that you two are of like minds family is very important to them and nothing will ever change that accept that your cancer is old fashioned traditional and loyal these aren t bad things in fact they can be quite positive when you nab a cancer they will be loyal to you to the moon and back they expect you to be the definition of romance loving kind maybe a bit conservative and just as loyal as they are nothing wrong with that when it comes to getting them in bed they may be a bit vanilla more romantic and sensual than spicy and exotic but if you get them to trust you they will be willing to open up their world as long as you show them it s safe know that they may have trust issues though trust issues are really a human thing cancers usually come with them right outta the gate they want to trust others they just find it hard especially with their great memories and their ability to hold grudges because of it however they love to love others so it s very much so a give and take this is probably cancer s main drawback it can be hard to crack their shell but if you re willing to put in the work it can be totally worth it you ll find a soft sensitive core that will put you above everyone and everything else realize that cancer needs to be needed if this sign were given one label it would be nurturer this is their default the only way they know how to operate so be willing to lean on them they love it they thrive on it be open with your needs and they ll seek to fulfill them it makes them happy let them take care of you when you re sick talk to them about a problem when one pops up ask them their advice for an issue at work or with your friends heck let them cook you dinner pretty good trade huh get ready to be supremely cared for cancers are the most nurturing of all the signs if you want a relationship that s more of the anxious and avoidant type cancer is not for you they will love showing you romance and affection hopefully you can reciprocate this isn t to say that they re clingy while they can be it s so genuine it s hard to hold it against them they just want to be around you and show you how much they care it s almost admirable if only everyone loved like a cancer can always be reassuring don t play hard to get cancer will probably think you re not interested and don t care about them if they seem to be feeling a bit insecure about themselves or the relationship don t hesitate to comfort them they d do the same for you they will not tolerate a temper on your behalf if you get angry or upset at the little things they ll think you re not being rational and seeing the big picture if you get too angry at them they ll think you don t care they can be quite sensitive when they feel vulnerable mean what you say cancers put a lot of weight in words if you offer them a declaration of love they ll take it as a declaration of love so mean what you say if you want to get a cancer in bed don t tell them you love them don t sugarcoat it won t get you anywhere if you don t mean what you say they ll probably see through it anyway and deem you a liar while you may not view it as lying they will so choose your words wisely cancer will remember what you say be direct cancer may not be open with you initially but once you get under the shell they ll expose their inner selves to you and expect honesty that rivals their own so be direct let them know how you feel you d appreciate the same behavior back wouldn t you sort through their bundle of complexities cancer is the crab they have a hard exterior that s very difficult to crack through but underneath is a person that s sensitive and emotional they can at times come off very weak but also be strong and independent in short they re a very dynamic unpredictable sign can you keep up they are very complex and can be quite fragile upset a cancer and they ll be upset for days when they feel safe and loved they are

mother when it s just you and her if you live with both of your parents but you ve decided you re most comfortable talking only to mom at first choose a time when your father is out of the house go with a time that he s at work or out for a few hours running errands alternatively go out with your mom to grab a coffee or lunch outside of the house it s usually a good idea to tell both your parents at once but there are plenty of situations where telling your mom first is more comfortable 1 x research source sometimes fathers can be more protective when it comes to first boyfriends some

in the same grade and he s a really nice and smart guy jot down some points to bring up if her response isn t the one you want say i thought you might not think i m ready but i wanted to mention that i m become a really mature person i m active at school i keep my grades up and i get all my chores done before you have to tell me i don t think i m going to marry him or anything but i think i m ready for my first boyfriend and definitely want to talk about your ground rules and ask your advice stress the positives when you have the conversation don t begin with all the negatives especially if your family wants you to date a certain type of person or has any sort of strict expectations don t start off by saying well he s really hot but he gets detention all the time and his grades are terrible focus on both your positive attributes and those of your boyfriend do you have good grades are you a leader at school or in after school activities how else are you mature or responsible these are traits that your parents will want to see in you before you get a boyfriend so be sure to work hard in school do your chores and show your parents how responsible you are similarly try to say as many positive things about him as possible show your mom that she can trust your judgment try telling her nice things he does for you how he well he treats you how sweet he is what his talents are and other good things about him considering his positive attributes can also help you decide if he s worthy of your time if you can t honestly list lots of positive things about him to your mom he s probably not the best for you have a photo or social media profile handy unless she s completely resistant to the idea of you having a boyfriend she ll probably want to know more about him be ready to share a picture of him so she knows what he looks like or show her his social media profile so she can learn a little bit about him remember don t just assume that she ll freak out especially if you re well into your teenage years or on the verge of becoming a young adult she might be overjoyed and want to gush about him with you 3 x research source while it s natural to be shy and want to keep your personal life private in most cases you do have to share information about your boyfriend with your parents 4 x research source avoid keeping it a secret remember that your mom was young once and you shouldn t just assume that she ll react negatively your parents will always find out something that you re hiding from them so keeping it a secret is not the best idea be sure to answer any questions about him truthfully 5 x research source if you want to show your mom that you re mature enough for a boyfriend you have to earn her trust keeping secrets will just harm the trust you have in one another 6 x research source don t lie about when you first started dating try to be honest about as many details as possible you don t want to get caught in a lie such as when your anniversary is later on down the line tell your mom that you re gay if you are gay have a boyfriend and would like to tell your mom about him do it when you re ready no one should force you to come out if you re not ready to do so while it a can be a great experience and take lots of pressure off it s okay to be nervous especially if you re not sure how your mom will react 7 x research source

especially if she didn t expect to hear that you have a boyfriend say i know this is a big adjustment and takes some time to think about believe me it s taken me a lot of time to process i get it consider when coming out isn t a good idea sometimes coming out of the closet isn t the best idea consider how your parents react to homosexuality in the news such as when issues like same sex marriage or bullying come up in conversation you might want to hold off if they both have very negative reactions or if you are financially dependent on them and think there s a chance they might kick you out of the house or stop paying your school tuition 8 x research source if you find that your mom is generally more accepting and want to tell her ask her for advice on how and when to come out to

your cross cultural relationship a secret whether you re a teenager or a grown adult what if years pass and you and your boyfriend get engaged further you don t want to create any more negative

the tensions that you might have with your traditions when telling your mother about a cross cultural relationship be compassionate and patient give your mom time to process and give her the benefit of the doubt rather than forcing her to give her approval consider holding off if you foresee bad consequences like coming out of the closet consider times when breaking the news about your cross cultural relationship might not be appropriate while it s often best to be honest if you have serious concerns about your safety your boyfriend s safety or think you ll be disowned consider holding off on breaking the news try to balance your concerns with having faith in your mom try to gauge her reactions to friends or family members in similar relationships if you believe your mom would be accepting but your father would not ask her for advice about how to break the news to him if you re with someone who treats you well and makes you happy don t let your mother or your father force you to take sides state clearly to her that this is a more interconnected world and that people date across boundaries now tell your mom your boyfriend has a checkered past but has changed it can be delicate if you re getting back with an ex or there are things in your boyfriend s past you d rather not tell your mom if you re trying to convince her that your boyfriend has changed his ways try to be objective and share facts with her don t match her criticisms of your boyfriend by criticizing her but just explain how his actions show that he s making real changes 10 x research source try

guy you re casually dating who has 8 piercings and full sleeve tattoos 11 x research source remember that your mom is looking out for your best interests if she doesn t approve of your boyfriend consider if she has good reasons you might be better off not getting back with that ex or ditching the guy who has too much baggage trusting mom s instincts could end up saving you heartache in the future give her time to process the news be patient after you tell her the news whether you re telling her about your first boyfriend are coming out or are telling her about a boyfriend who might not meet her expectations don t just break the news then get up and walk away wait for her to reply and give feedback if she tells you that she needs a minute to think by all means give her some time alone if necessary show her that you want to compromise and help her become comfortable with your relationship such as by hearing her ground rules if she s uneasy or on the fence ask her what her rules would be as far as when you see him or whether you can be alone together 12 x research source tell her that you value her opinion and experience show her that her experience and wisdom is

for you have to keep your cool and think before you speak 14 x research source she might have a good reason for disapproving you might actually be too young for a relationship or he might not be the best guy for you remember that she has more life experience than you if you re a teenager or young adult and truly believe that you are ready for a relationship your goal should be to prove to her that you are becoming mature enough to make some of your own decisions accept her response even if she says no taking a tantrum if she says you can t have a boyfriend will only prove to your mom that you re not ready for a relationship respect the way that she wants to raise you remember she s only here to protect you 15 x research source reacting in an understanding and calm way will show her your maturity level if she can see that you re growing up and becoming more mature she ll come around eventually try to understand her perspective if she says no show your mom that you value her point

good taste avoid pda public displays of affection are not appropriate for the first time you meet a parent remember that pda might make his parents uncomfortable just as seeing his parents pda might be uncomfortable for you this time is for you to begin developing a relationship with your boyfriend s mum not about you and your boyfriend hands off for a few hours 5 x research source remember that

signal coughing pulling his ear if you are talking too much you can also keep an eye out for behavioral gestures that indicate the listeners is losing interest such as looking away or gestures that indicate the listener can t get a word in like them opening their mouth to says something but then stopping find common interests learn about her hobbies ahead of time from your boyfriend if you have something in common come prepared with some stories of your own do you both love to travel have her share some of her trips with you and ask for her advice for example mike told me you went to italy last year i ve never been there which cities did you visit if you both enjoy watching football talk about your favorite team or recent games be agreeable now is not the time to be the authority on everything do your best to keep the peace and maintain a positive impression stick to neutral topics now is not the time to bring up religion politics or your ex boyfriends for example try building on the statement you disagree with in order to continue the conversation maybe you don t agree with her assessment that everyone is glued to their phones these days instead of disagreeing and letting her statement hang there you could say i always feel like i need to have my phone with me i have so much important information on it change the subject if you are worried you will get into an argument ask her about your boyfriend she ll enjoy telling stories about him and as a bonus you both share a common interest have her tell you stories about what he was like as a child ask her about family traditions like holidays and favorite recipes remember that she has known him longer don t be a know it all when it comes to your boyfriend she s known him his whole life and you ve known him for a few months 8 x research source don t correct her about his preferences if his mother serves him scrambled eggs and you know for a fact he only likes his eggs poached right now don t say anything he can let her know keep your nose out of your boyfriend and his mother s relationship they have their own dynamic and their own ways of relating you might not like her nitpicky criticism of her son but that is up to him to address with her not you watch your sense of humor make sure it is not directed at her and that it doesn t cross the line into inappropriate territory you will have to figure out her sense of humor and how far you can stretch yours jokes about sex religion and politics should be avoided jokes that are overly sarcastic or put people down will likely not leave her with a favorable impression invite her places ask her to join you and your boyfriend for brunch a trip to a museum or another non romantic date she may not accept but it always feels good to receive an invitation think of her keep your eyes open and look for ways to further develop your relationship with her for example if she loves art and you see a notice for a special exhibit let her know about it continue to share your common interests she ll appreciate the effort you are putting into the relationship to further your conversations go with whatever common ground you can find even if it s something as small as a mutual love of a tv show for example so have you started rewatching downton abbey i think i m going to i miss it so much who was your favorite character on it again ask her advice people love to be needed and helpful learn her areas of expertise and ask for help in them 9 x research source for example if she is a terrific baker ask her to suggest an easy recipe you could learn so you could improve your baking if she loves gardening ask to see her garden and for suggestions for plants you could grow offer to help do the dishes after dinner at her house bring a side dish to a family meal or take out the trash she may say you don t need to do anything and if so take her at her word 10 x research source if you are having a hard time talking to her doing a chore may also get you a break from your conversation invite her over for dinner invite her to your place for dinner with you and your boyfriend you do not need to serve an elaborate meal you could even order food in but put a little effort into making a nice cozy evening for her address the tension if you feel coldness or distance in the relationship chances are she feels it too don t let resentment build up between the two of you after all you may be in each other s lives for a while do your part to clear the air for example you could say cindy i think we got off to a bad start i respect you and want to have a good relationship with you could we try again apologize take responsibility for your behavior if you did something to fall out of favor with your boyfriend s mother own up to it and apologize make sure you acknowledge the pain or anger you caused 11 x research source for example i know i was rude when i was making fun of your driving i know it wasn t funny to you and it hurt your feelings i m so sorry make changes going forward figure out what you can do to improve the relationship it may be changing a small behavior or it may mean changing up your environment for example if you got drunk and were obnoxious around her do not drink around her anymore do your best to curb an annoying behavior maybe she is a picky eater and isn t impressed by your culinary skills or restaurant choices maybe she has cat allergies and your cat was climbing all over her when she came over you may find that her grievance disappears if she is simply in a more comfortable place talk to her privately you may want to have a conversation with her without your boyfriend present this will help keep the two of you from trying to get him to choose sides enlist your boyfriend s help have your boyfriend address the problem if you do not feel like you are getting through to her he may find it easier to talk to her given his history and better understanding of her personality 12 x research source this is something you should do only if you have not been successful in talking to her yourself it is much better to handle things with her directly if you can let it go if all else fails you don t need to bend over backwards to placate her changing who you are for her will only make you resentful 13 x research source it s okay if you do not become best buds just make sure you always remain polite and respectful to her she is still an important part of your boyfriend s life,Relationships

become suspicious of your questions listen and don t try to interject unless they ask you a question you can start the conversation by saying something like when did you start dating or how did you meet dad get their perspective and understand their values on dating and love your parents grew up in a different generation so dating when they were your age was much different 1 x research source for that reason you should get their perspective on dating even if you think it s old fashioned and you don t agree the more that you understand why your parents are so opposed to dating the more you ll understand ways to change their mind or ease their concerns 2 x research source sometimes your parents don t want you to date because of your cultural background or religious reasons in these cases it may be harder or impossible to change their mind 3 x research source saying things like times have changed may not be the best way to persuade your parents even though it may be true develop solutions to change their status of disapproval once you understand their perspective think of solutions to change their mind figure out reasons why you parents don t want you to date and prove them wrong if they say you are too irresponsible take up more responsibilities around the house discuss things that you parents want you to do in order to date and make sure to put effort towards them if you really want to date and really like the person you want to date you ll do what it takes if dating is dominating your mind and taking you away from your responsibilities try to get better at a hobby or sport to sharpen your focus don t talk about how you will change show your parents through your actions explain who and why you want to date sometimes parents distrust other people not you so it s important to talk to your parents about who you want to date 4 x research source highlight the positives about the person like any sports or activities they are participating in and explain what you have in common always stay away from the negative things and make sure the reasons you want to date them are genuine you can bring the person up before you tell your parents you want to date them say something like there s a person at school named insert name here and they are top of the class the more you talk about your relationship or your desire to date the more your parents will want to be involved in a positive way things that you might find cool about the person are the same things you parents might disapprove of so it s important to understand what they want to hear if the person you are dating is good in school this is a huge plus for most parents refrain from yelling or getting emotional yelling at your parents is never going to get them to change their mind about dating and can actually damage your chances of ever dating while you live with them 5 x research source never get in fights about their views on you dating just remain calm and try to change their minds if the issue is getting heated and if you feel like an argument is brewing just drop it before it gets out of hand accept their decision and change the subject if you feel the conversation is getting negative or you are getting emotional don t walk away in the middle of a fight or ignore you parents that shows immaturity instead try to resolve the issue but respect their opinion at all times say i understand your perspective but i don t agree i love you so i ll do what you say but i d like to talk about it later when i m not so emotional please you won t change your parent s minds in one conversation it may take a while for them to come around don t ever act snide or sarcastic with you parents because it will damage your chances of them saying yes in the future revisit the issue at a later date sometimes parents just need time before they get used to the idea that their child is old enough to date someone 6 x research source if you can show them that you are ready for dating by fulfilling some of their expectations this will translate into them treating you more like an adult wait a couple of weeks or a month and then revisit the issue once they have had time to think about your side of things you can start the conversation by saying i know you told me you disapprove of dating in the past but i ve been taking care of all my responsibilities and i want to spend time with this person you may not think it s important but it s really affecting me emotionally and i think i m emotionally mature enough to start don t ask them or talk about it every day show them that you are mature dating someone requires maturity and is one of the main reasons many parents don t want their children to date making mistakes or being immature or careless in a relationship can have real long lasting consequences maturity means taking care of your responsibilities without being asked or reminded and making responsible decisions a major reason parents don t want kids to date is because they are doing poorly in school the more that you show you can handle your life and your responsibilities the more you parents will think you can handle dating someone maturity also means not arguing or bickering with you parents constantly try to go with the flow and make life easy for both of you help more around the house it might seem unrelated but sometimes parents are just stressed and need more help around the house take the initiative at home to help the family do all your chores without being asked to do them and ask your parents if they need help the more you get on their good side the more they re likely to let you date go beyond the chores help your parents out with stuff that takes up their time if you can gain their respect they will start to open up about dating surprising your parents by taking initiative will always make them happier and possibly more receptive about dating be open and honest at all times another main culprit to why some parents don t want their children to date is a betrayal of trust that has taken place prior if you ve went behind your parent s back before they can t trust you won t do it again this specifically applies to sex and the potential of stis or an unplanned pregnancy 7 x research source the more open and honest you are with your parents even if they disapprove the more they will respect you and will want to be involved in a positive way with your relationships apologize about lying the first time and tell them that you understand why it was wrong convince them by consistently telling the truth even if it doesn t work in your favor because it will show them that you won t hide things from them don t go against them and date behind their back because it could have bad repercussions down the line and they may restrict you from dating for an even longer time sometimes the best way to build trust is to tell your parents something that you did that they will disapprove of if you show that you re honest even when it looks bad they ll start to think that you ll always be honest with them it might be hard to keep truthful if you parents punish you every time you do something wrong but it s the only way to build their trust accept their decisions and try to compromise with them ultimately you live under your parents roof and they provide you with the food and clothing you have so you need to respect their final decision if you ve taken all the steps to win their trust and understand them and they still don t want you to date try to compromise with them things like agreeing not to date for the next year getting better grades or not getting into trouble may be a compromise that could open the doors for dating for you there is usually a good reason your parents don t want you to date so don t dismiss their opinions immediately be honest with yourself about dating even though you may really like a person it doesn t mean you are ready to date 8 x research source make sure they re the right person before you introduce your potential significant other to your parents you should ask yourself if this person is good enough if you re scared they might embarrass you maybe you should re think dating this person in the first place if your parents don t want you to date and your date leaves a negative impression it may hurt your chances in the future think about how this person acts around older people and teachers and you can assume the behavior may be similar bring the person around as a friend and let them get to know them a good way to introduce the person you want to date to your parents is by introducing them first as a friend this will make it so that your parents don t have immediate bias for the person if you get in trouble with your friend then your parents may get a negative impression and restrict you from dating them let your parents know they are coming beforehand to avoid an awkward situation introduce their parents to your parents one way to alleviate the stress that your parents may have with dating is by introducing them to your date s parents if they speak to one another they may develop a friendship and a positive impression of the person you re trying to date some parents look for a strong family behind anyone you re dating if this is the case this approach may win them over you can do this at a public sporting event or at a show explain the situation to the person you want to date if you really want to date someone but your parents won t let you you should let that person know that way they won t take anything personally but also so that they know to be on their best behavior when they meet them you can say i really like you and want to date you but i can t constantly fight with my parents so please act respectful and try to make a good impression when you meet them if you understand their perspective you can relay that onto your date and hopefully they will act appropriate and likable,Relationships

to get to know you better you might say we have a test coming up next week maybe i could come over sunday afternoon and we could study here if they say no to everything you could ask do you think we could talk about this again in a few months accept that you may need to wait a little bit to date but you may still have other ways to see their daughter in a school extracurricular or social setting

transportation let her parents know how you are getting there and back if they are not comfortable with you driving for example propose alternatives without argument provide your contact information give them your phone number return their calls or texts promptly you could also give them your address and your parents phone numbers so they have other ways to get in touch with you parents like to know how to get in touch easily you could ask your parents to talk to her parents be brave and ask your own parents if her parents could call them with any questions about your character if your home life isn t great and don t think your parents could speak well of your character you could ask another trusted adult in your life to talk to her parents if necessary avoid sneaking around respect the

them you are that person encourage their daughter when she speaks talk about how accomplished she is or how many great qualities she has and don t demean her or talk down to her be a gentleman and treat her like a lady though you may tease each other in private try to keep this to a minimum in front of her parents at first until they truly understand your dynamic otherwise they may think that you don t respect her keep the pda to a minimum there are other ways to show your girlfriend s parents how much you like her without trying to make out with her or grope her in front of them if you really want to show that you like her then you should be respectful towards her maybe holding her hand or showing a bit of affection but you should definitely not overdo it fathers don t generally like to see their daughters being touched by other men so keep that in mind the next time you find yourself with your special lady s parents though you don t want to be cold and distant toward her not showing too much pda is a sign of respect toward her parents make it clear how much you like their daughter at the end of the day the most important thing parents care about is how much you like their daughter you could be a billionaire or ryan gosling and they wouldn t care at all if you seemed distant or condescending to their daughter though you don t have to praise her to the high heavens or force something that isn t there you should make it clear that their daughter is really special to you by finding ways to subtly compliment her and show her affection and by talking about her accomplishments or the things you like to do together make them see that you re serious about their daughter and that you realize how special she is even the fact that you re going out of your way to be nice to her parents will show them how much she means to you if you act like you don t really care what they think of you then they ll think you don t really care about their daughter don t come off as a slacker another thing parents don t want to see is that their daughter is dating a guy who lacks ambition or isn t going to amount to much you don t have to be mr mba but you shouldn t talk about how much you hate school or work or about how you think the system is pointless sure you can have these thoughts but keep them to yourself around your girlfriend s parents at least until you re sure they really really like you you want them to think that you will amount to something and that you and their daughter will make a great team though it s old fashioned to say that your girlfriend s parents will want you to be a good provider for her it s fair to say that they want to see a guy who can at least take care of himself if you talk about mooching off your parents getting bad grades or how much you like to booze it up with your bros they will not be won over hey if school or work isn t really your thing talk about something you really care about like playing the guitar or collecting stamps just make it seem like you care about something be engaged the important thing is that you act like you care about the conversations you re having with your girlfriend s parents even if you re talking about doing your taxes or growing cauliflower ask lots of questions nod politely and give her parents your full attention make sure you react if they re trying to make jokes and seem like you re genuinely happy to be there and interested in what they have to say this will make a big difference and will show them that you re a nice young man 11 x research source when they ask you questions

father says so i hear you re studying history don t just say yes i am instead say i m a history major with a focus in american studies i ve always been kind of a history buff give them your full attention 12 x research source the most important thing is that you put away your phone seriously stop texting your friends to make plans for later stop checking your team s score on espn com and stop checking your email randomly no matter how tempting it may be turn it off if you have to the last thing you want to do is to annoy her parents by acting too cool for school by looking at your phone every five seconds if you re out at a restaurant and the game is on in the background sorry buddy but you ll have to miss out on that one be as mature as you can 13 x research source this doesn t have to mean you have to act all formal if you re only 16 but that you should try to show that you re on the way to becoming a mature young man be polite use good manners don t use vulgar language and be graceful and kind during conversation you can show that you re mature by talking about your future plans talking about your family with respect avoiding whining or complaining too much and by not making any comments that make you seem clueless remember that your girlfriend s parents no matter what age you are want her to be dating a man not a boy they want her to be with someone who will be a good influence on her and who will encourage her to grow have good manners another important thing to do around your girlfriend s parents is to demonstrate that you have good manners you don t have to go over the top and act like british aristocracy but you should make sure to say please and thank you at the correct times 14 x research source to ask the people at the table to pass the food instead of reaching across the table and grabbing it yourself to pull the chair out for your girlfriend unless she and her parents are more progressive in that regard and to not interrupt people when they are speaking 15 x research source it s also polite to know what to call her parents this part is easy just call them whatever they call themselves when you are introduced if her dad says call me jim then don t be afraid to call him jim however if he introduces himself as mr smith then you should call him that until he tells you to do otherwise avoid controversial topics the last thing you want to do is to get embroiled in a debate about the political situation in ukraine or the catholic church with your girlfriend s parents in the middle of what was supposed to be a nice dinner if you know that you have very different politics or if you just want to be polite then you should stray away from controversial topics you will not impress anyone and this will only lead to an embarrassing and uncomfortable conversation if you feel that the conversation is getting uncomfortable because her parents don t agree with your beliefs try to delicately change the subject you can say something like i may not go to church on sunday but i like watching baseball during the day mr jones i hear you re a big giants fan once you get to know your girlfriend s parents you can discuss these topics more however in the beginning it s better to stick to the safe topics even if it s a little boring give sincere compliments 16 x research source another way you can impress your girlfriend s parents and act appropriately around them is to compliment them or something about them in some way this shouldn t sound forced and you shouldn t do it too often but a well timed compliment can really help them see that you appreciate their company and care for their daughter 17 x research source even if the compliment is a bit silly they will like the fact that you re trying here are some things you can compliment a painting souvenir or piece of furniture in their home the food you re eating if they cooked it her mother s earrings be honest parents love honesty no matter what the situation is it makes them feel more comfortable about their daughter being with you so always answer their questions with honesty not only that but parents have a lot more experience than you do they can tell if you re being dishonest no matter how good you think you are this doesn t mean you have to be honest about every little thing like how much you like to smoke pot but that you shouldn t lie to them when it comes to important topics such as your education or future plans exude confidence tell yourself that you are a good guy who cares deeply for the daughter of these people make yourself feel secure and certain of yourself without a trace of a cocky attitude it isn t enough to just pretend to be confident you need to feel it as well or else it won t reflect as well as you hoped it would if you want your girlfriend s parents to really have faith in you then you have to have faith in yourself first 18 x research source speak directly and be frank make sure that when you first meet the parents you maintain eye contact when you are speaking with them 19 x research source don t look away mumble or trail off sound confident in what you say and show that you have convictions and that you believe in yourself 20 x research source try to avoid saying uh too much or turning to your girlfriend for help when you re at a loss for words it s okay to take a minute to formulate your words when you need to don t act nervous no matter how nervous you are keep your head held high don t fidget look around the room or take too long to answer a question just take a deep breath and tell her parents whatever you need to say it s okay to feel nervous but you should minimize letting them see how you re feeling as much as you can if you come off as nervous then they ll thick you lack confidence and that you re unprepared just keep telling yourself that if your girlfriend likes you that her parents will like you too don t be nervous about looking nervous that will only make things worse 21 x research source at the end of the day know that it s no tragedy if you come off as a littler nervous your girlfriend s parents once also had to go through the awkwardness of meeting the parents and they ll understand where you re coming from don t forget to be yourself 22 x research source don t fake a personality just to win over the parents you should not have to change for anyone just to impress them remember your girlfriend chose to be with you for a reason and plus parents can sense when guys are faking there s a difference between letting them see the more mature and responsible sides of yourself and pretending to be a completely different person completely if you plan on being with their daughter in the long run then you can t keep up an act forever,Relationships

your waist you and cindy seemed to be sharing a lot of inside jokes last night after the movie and didn t spend time conversing with anyone else that makes it seem like you re flirting with her you can use this as an opportunity to make a list of boundaries that are important for each of you in the relationship talk with your friend about the incident it s best to talk with your friend directly

coffee avoid lashing out in anger or frustration as soon as you see your friend stay calm and avoid making accusations 9 x research source say something like i consider you to be a good friend and

confront them aggressively or with hostility instead have an attitude of concerned curiosity mention the specific behaviors that you took to be flirting explain that this upset you and ask your friend to explain themselves for example say it seemed to me like you were flirting with sharon at the party yesterday when you kissed her cheek after dinner that bothered me can you explain why you did that

you soon to discuss my relationship with your daughter if he agrees to the meeting set up a time and place let him pick it out since you re asking him a favor if he asks for more information you can emphasize that you d really like to meet with him in person dress to impress your potential girlfriend s father will not be impressed if you show up in clothes full of holes or covered in stains you don t have to dress in a suit however some nice pants a button up shirt and a tie wouldn t hurt 8 x research source dressing up shows that you respect him and his daughter and he ll be more likely to say yes also make sure everything is ironed and you re not missing any buttons or anything be on time if you say you re going to show up at 4 00 p m make sure you are strictly on time being about 10 minutes early is even better though you don t want to show up much earlier than that especially if you re going to his house as he may not be ready for you showing up on time shows you respect him

makes you uncomfortable but compliment something that s connected to him for example you could compliment his house or his car such as your house is really amazing be direct you don t want to spend time beating around the bush being direct is a much better approach and it shows you have bravery because it does take bravery to say that to a potential girlfriend s father therefore start out by

ready for your daughter to date i completely understand that concern work on goals together one way you can help your cause is to set boundaries with your potential girlfriend s father that is once you hear his concerns try to figure out if there s a way you can calm his fears by agreeing to certain terms 15 x research source you could say i hear what you re saying what could i do to make you feel better about me dating your daughter i would be willing to agree to whatever boundaries you set for example maybe we could start with group dating or we could even go on a date with your supervision i m willing to prove to you that i m worthy of dating your daughter remember what permission means that is you want to know if your potential girlfriend s father thinks it s fine for you to date his daughter then it s up to him he can say yes but you ve also given him a chance to say no if he says no you must accept that response 16 x research source,Relationships

to something she says politely ask her to repeat the sentence rather than trying to improvise a safe response speak confidently about yourself mom will surely want to know a little about your

have a long term plan that will offer financial stability regardless of your current employment situation if you have a job that you don t see yourself keeping long term one way to explain this would

outings you went on together and things you enjoy doing in general giving examples of how you interact will reassure her that you re spending quality time together and are an important part of each other s happiness for example you can try something along the lines of until i met girlfriend s name i was a little unsure about yoga but she s really gotten me into it and now we practice it together

to to speak with someone with a blank expression to show her that you ve been attentive to her remarks try paraphrasing mom says we have dinner with the neighbors across the street a few times a year and their cooking is outstanding you respond good neighbors and good food how fortunate if something she says doesn t make sense to you or is inaudible instead of bluntly saying what do you mean or what did you say try asking for clarification pardon my asking i m not sure i heard you correctly could you say again why you chose to study biology watch your manners make sure your table manners are

experienced a similar situation and connect with how she is feeling everyone needs attention and to feel seen and heard and recognized remember this and consider how you might provide this need for attention to your girlfriend s mother limit your drinks remember your alcohol tolerance when sharing a drink with her and avoid the temptation to have just one more even if she insists if you usually

research source demonstrate your good judgement by assuring her as much as i d like another drink i ll have to pass since i m behind the wheel tonight thank her for her hospitality if mom has hosted you for a meal at her home show your appreciation by thanking her warmly and offering to host her at your residence mention something that you enjoyed during the gathering such as a certain dish from the meal or a memorable story that she told for example you could express how pleased you are by saying mrs ms brown i m grateful for your generosity in inviting us to share a lunch dinner with you it was really a treat to compliment her storytelling try something to the effect of i ll always remember the story you told about your aunt paula s unusual bridge club or we all had a good laugh listening to your tale about the new york cab driver didn t we help with cleaning up if she hosts you for a meal take charge of cleaning up afterwards once everyone has finished eating the main course

how to tell your family you are dating outside your race,once socially frowned upon in some cultures more and more people accept interracial dating and marriage as a non issue these days one factor that still inhibits interracial relationships is a fear that family will react negatively and reject the relationship 1 x research source there are a lot of reasons for this fear including prejudice and racism among your family members ignorance about other cultures or a fear of cultural incompatibility if you are worried about your family s reaction to the news that you are dating someone outside your race you may want to initiate a conversation to let them know and to reassure them about any concerns they may have the type of conversation you have may differ depending on whether you live at home or if you are an independent adult,don t make assumptions you may know from experience that your family will not be supportive but more often this is a gray area in families because it is not frequently discussed jumping to conclusions about their reactions might set you up to be overly defensive for no reason or to be blindsided by a negative reaction 2 x research source your family may surprise you by accepting the relationship on the other hand some families can harbor secret biases and prejudices and you may not realize it until you happen to be dating interracially giving their true colors a chance to show through give them the benefit of the doubt while steeling yourself for the worst think about how you will react in all possible scenarios including if they ask you to end the relationship but try not to worry too much beforehand talk to supportive family first for example if your parents are closed minded talk to your siblings first if they agree with you they can be supportive when you break it to the parents if possible recruit the support of older well trusted family members that your closed minded family members respect maybe you have an older aunt or uncle that everyone reveres who is likely to support your relationship tell your supportive family members that you are in a relationship and you would like some advice or support in telling the rest of the family then tell them your new partner is another race and you re not sure how the rest of your family will react to the news talk to your parents or other closed minded family members you can choose if you want to make a big deal out of the conversation by telling them you need to talk about something important in advance or if you would rather just bring it up more casually in conversation generally making a big deal out of any topic puts people on the defensive by making them assume the worst beforehand since you want your parents to be open and accepting casually bringing it up might yield better results try saying over dinner hey did you know i have a new boyfriend they are likely to ask questions about him and you can find a way to drop in he s the first asian guy i have dated try framing it as advice seeking instead of dropping the news frame it as you seeking advice from them which flatters them and makes them feel that you value their opinion and is thus more likely to get them on your team 3 x research source try saying i was wondering if you could give me some advice i have this new girlfriend and i like her a lot but i think sometimes people treat us differently because she s white and i m not have you ever dated someone outside our race stay calm if your parents challenge you or question why you are dating outside your race your goal is to show them that you are mature and can handle whatever negativity they might dish out after all if you pursue this relationship you are likely to encounter bias out there in the world since many people have

not upset and you can talk about it calmly 5 x research source prepare responses to common objections there are several typical objections that some people have to interracial relationships but fortunately there are also great responses some examples include his her family s culture is too different from ours you can respond to this by saying that it s possible that the cultural divide might be too great but you will cross that bridge when you get there you want to get to know him and his family as individuals before judging his family for their race i don t like people of that race this objection is hard to deal with because it isn t rational or your parents might have their viewpoints because of their experience with people of that race offer to listen while your parents explain their point of view after you have listened to your parents reasons you could point out that it is not fair to generalize all people of that race based on a few negative experiences do your best to have a reasonable discussion with your parents and avoid judging them before you have heard the whole story i don t mind interracial relationships in principle but people will treat you differently in truth this objection is not wrong many people do frown on interracial relationships and might treat you badly because of it tell your family member you are aware that it might be harder to have an interracial relationship but that you and your partner are prepared to deal with social consequences for your choice it s wrong to date that person because any children you might have will be treated differently tell your family member that you are aware that interracial children might be treated differently but that you would provide a supportive home and do everything you could to educate and love your child to be prepared to live in this world you can also say that you don t intend to have children any time soon and that you feel that you have enough time to prepare for that situation if it ever occurs be prepared to explain it s a good idea to mentally rehearse all the things you like about your partner so that you re prepared when your parents ask why you are dating him or her emphasize qualities and characteristics that you know your family would want in a partner for you regardless of race especially emphasize how your partner makes you feel and talk about some of the ways your relationship is healthy where previous relationships might not have been 6 x expert source collette gee relationship coach certified violence prevention specialist expert interview 1 may

about your own values as well you might say something like you taught me to be loving fair kind and generous and i ve met someone who shares those values with me 7 x expert source collette gee relationship coach certified violence prevention specialist expert interview 1 may 2020 prepare yourself for consequences if your parents are dead set against letting you date outside your race and if you are living at home and are a minor you may have to follow your family s rules until you move out of the home otherwise your family may punish you by grounding you or taking away privileges if your parents forbid you from dating this person you have to decide if you will obey their wishes realize that you do not need your family s approval when you ve moved out of the house and are supporting yourself as an adult you can make relationship choices that your family disapproves of with less concern for their feelings on the matter however even though you don t live at home there can still be negative consequences if your family is not accepting for example they may make comments about you behind your back treat your partner unkindly at family get togethers or in more extreme cases cut you off entirely or disinherit any potential children of the relationship on the other hand they may need some time to adjust to the news but eventually come around and treat your partner with love and respect choose your approach because you are not living at home you have the luxury of putting off telling your family if you want to you can choose to make a point to tell your family sooner rather than later or you can let them find out when it comes up naturally for example on facebook or during the holidays if you think they are likely to overreact in a negative way telling them upfront can spare your partner some embarrassment if they say or do something unkind otherwise letting them find out on their own has a lot of benefits if your relationship is not serious it prevents unneeded drama it also sends the message that the racial issue is not a big deal to you and thus not worth mentioning avoid bringing your partner around until you ve had a chance to talk to your family that way you aren t bringing your significant other into a situation that s unwelcoming or hostile for instance you might say this is the person i m dating i love you and i love them too if that means our

reaction it is probably best not to make a big deal of your news don t email and say we need to talk which will cause them to expect something negative and prepare for the worst instead drop the news in casually when you are having a normal catching up conversation on the phone or over lunch be positive when you are discussing what s new in your life mention your relationship be upbeat and let

few times and i really like him i want you to meet him sometime soon he s the first asian guy i ve dated and he s so handsome let your family member react give your family member time to respond if they want but don t force them to comment on the racial issue truly they may not care at all and forcing them to talk about it might feel uncomfortable and unnecessary if they do respond be prepared to react don t let your family member get away with saying anything racist or uncalled for if they start to say something rude or racist stop them and say listen i realize you may have mixed feelings but i don t want to hear anything like that about mark they may also respond with ambivalence not knowing what to say or feel if they did not expect that news and aren t sure how they feel about it

she can get to know me better be polite but direct if you happen to bump heads with your boyfriend s mom come right out and address the issue head on this will protect you from having to tiptoe around trying to dodge the problem later use your best judgment but aim to be forthright and respectful 8 x research source for example his mom makes a rude comment you might say i couldn t help but feel tension from you earlier did i say or do something wrong if it s clear she doesn t like you you might say i get the sense you don t really like me which hurts because i really care about your son for his benefit is there a way we can work things out and be civil listen actively the worst thing you can do is act like you know more than his mom if she s talking give her your full attention even if what s she s saying is hurtful or difficult to hear try not to interrupt until she has gotten her message across lots of people have misunderstandings because they listen to respond instead of listening to understand really think about what your boyfriend s mom is saying is she really trying to hurt you or is she just looking after the welfare of her son 9 x research source ask for her advice from time to time if you re stumped on what to get your boyfriend for his birthday or having trouble planning a surprise for him ask his mom for recommendations she ll be happy to help and will enjoy the feeling of being included in your relationship avoid asking your boyfriend s mom for advice about relationship issues you ll put her in an awkward position and she probably won t be able give you an objective opinion stand up for yourself if necessary if your date s mom is extremely controlling or disrespectful to you you may just have to stand up for yourself this may mean setting a boundary about how you expect to be treated or calling her out for rude behavior for example you might say i can t help it you don t like me mrs rhodes but i expect to be treated with respect just as i do you please don t call me names anymore my name is brittany learn how to deal with major issues if marriage may be in your future it s especially important to solve long term conflicts if you

relationship with your boyfriend make sure he will support you even if it means disagreeing with or spending less time with his mom if he can t agree to that consider your relationship as a whole and

stick to a set manageable time like an hour or two or even a short hello and gradually increase how often the children spend time with you this helps the children ease into meeting you and getting used to you try asking the children about their favorite subjects in school hobbies favorite toys activities they like to do etc for example you can say something like what is your favorite thing about school or what do you like to do for fun try not to talk too much about yourself instead focus on asking questions and showing your significant other s children that you find them interesting you can do this by listening carefully and asking follow up questions to keep them talking for example if one of the children says she likes to play soccer try saying something like that s cool what position do you play or what do you like best about playing soccer allow the relationship with the children to develop slowly though you may instantly feel affection for your significant other s children the reverse may not be true relationships need time to grow and this is especially true for stepparent stepchild relationships understand that the kids will take time to look at you as an authority figure or a figure they love try to be patient as the relationship develops keep being a caring loving figure in the children s life while you let the relationship develop at a natural pace 2 x research source ask the children about what is new in their lives since you last saw them for example you can say something like how was school this week or what s new with you this will show the children that you are interested in their lives follow up when the children tell you about things they are worried or excited about for example if one of the children says she is anxious about a big test ask her about it the next time you see her try saying something like how was your math test this will show that you are paying attention to what they tell you and you care about what happens to them join in activities the children enjoy one way to build a relationship between you and the children is to do activities with the children that they enjoy ask the children what they like to do and offer to do it with them if you really enjoy an activity offer to let the children come with you or teach them how to do your hobby 3 x research source for example if the children love playing video

interests this will help show the children that you care about them 4 x research source if the children talk to you about private issues they don t feel comfortable going to their parents about keep it private this only applies as long as the information doesn t endanger the children or anyone else make time for the relationship between your significant other and the children many times it may seem to the children that you are stealing their mom or dad because you are spending a lot of time with them the children may not be used to having you around doing things their other parent used to do make sure that you make time for your significant other to spend time and do things with the children without you around this will help them to feel more secure and view you less as a threat 5 x research source for example if your significant other only sees their children every other weekend or once a month the children may need quality time with their parent letting the children and your significant other spend time together alone may help your relationship with the children more than always trying to spend time with them 6 x research source just as important make sure that you are not resentful or angry that your significant other needs to spend quality time with their kids without you sometimes allowing them this time helps keep the children from thinking that you are taking away their parent ask for support from your significant other if you are having trouble with your significant other s children disrespecting you or treating you badly then you should discuss it with your significant other they are the biological parent and should not allow their kids to disrespect you or fail to make any efforts toward accepting you sometimes the words of their parent can intervene and help mitigate the problems 7 x research source if you have any problems early on do not act like the disciplinarian but ask your partner to intervene on your behalf try to empathize with your significant other s children getting your significant other s children to accept you might be challenging for the children the situation can be scary confusing and hurtful they might not feel ready to develop a relationship with you just yet remember the children have dealt with a divorce or a death they may have moved from their home or changed schools and they may have had to lose friends or even pets along with these changes 8 x research source be patient and understanding with the children try to put yourself into their shoes and think about how you might feel as a result of all of these changes understand that the children may still want their parents together sometimes the children may not be resistant to the idea of you because of anything that you have done instead the kids may be holding on to the hope that their parents are going to get back together when you enter into the family you become a reminder that the parents will not get back together allow the children time to work through the hurt and grief that their parents will never reunite 9 x research source this doesn t just happen with young kids many older kids keep hoping that their parents will one day get back together avoid trying to replace the other parent though you may now be in a parental role because of your relationship with your significant other this does not mean you should try to replace the children s birth parent you are serving a new role for the children as a third or fourth loving adult figure 10 x research source don t tell the children that you are their mother or father this can cause problems in your relationship if they feel you are trying to take the place of their birth parent some kids may feel guilty when they start to feel love or affection for you they may start to think that their feelings for you mean that they no longer love their birth parent help them to understand that they can love both of you because you are not their birth parent and are not trying to take that role help them learn that you have a different role in their life refrain from being fake or insincere no matter the age of your significant other s children they will be able to tell if you are sincere or not don t try to be fake or overly enthusiastic to get them to like you if you need time to get used to the kids or the situation then give yourself time don t be rude to the children but don t be fake or insincere either that might cause more harm in the long run 11 x research source instead of being insincere with fake affection or showing fake enthusiasm treat the children like someone you are getting to know if the children are adults then treat them like you would any adult you are learning about and trying to form a relationship with if the children are younger talk to them like a person instead of talking down to them fake condescending tones or conversations may do harm to your relationship for example don t use baby talk or change the tone of your voice when you talk to the children avoid causing problems between your significant other and the children sometimes you may accidentally cause problems between your significant other and the children avoid trying to cause problems between them if you have concerns about the way things are with your significant other and the children or you have concerns about the parenting style talk to your significant other separately to try and come up with a healthy solution 12 x research source for example you do not want to force your significant other to choose between you and their kids because this is an impossible choice or a choice you may not be happy with if the significant other chooses the children you also do not want to try and turn your significant other against the other birth parent this may cause problems between your significant other and the children refrain from being their friend you may be tempted to get the children to like you by any means necessary this means you may decide to try and be the children s friend or act like the cool sibling refrain from doing this though you are not their birth parent you are still an adult figure in their life you will have to enforce discipline and act as an adult 13 x research source you can enjoy things they like and spend time with them but remember to keep it on a caring adult child level not as a best friend refrain from engaging in harmful activities with them to get them to like you like lying or covering up for them or condoning inappropriate behavior behind your significant other s back even if the children are adults you should never try to become best friends with them this could cause problems with the overall family dynamic avoid talking badly about the other parent never talk badly or disrespect the children s other birth parent no matter what your feelings are about the other birth parent talking badly about them will more than likely lead to problems between you and the children and probably problems between you and the birth parent instead be positive and supportive of the relationship between the children and the other birth parent even if you are having trouble with the other birth parent in your new relationship leave the children out of the problems and keep it just between the adults never make it seem like you re a threat to the other parent make certain the children understand that you are not trying to replace their birth parent or take the place of the birth parent encourage the children to talk about their birth parent or spend time with them respect the children if you want respect from the children you should return the same respect to the children this means you should respect the feelings opinions and interests of the children if the children don t like you or the situation right now back off and try to let the relationship grow naturally don t try to force the children to do anything against their will remember no matter the age the children are people with feelings too 14 x research source make sure you respect each child s privacy don t go snooping in their rooms go through their stuff or listen in on their phone calls treat the children like family if you are living with your significant other then you may be tempted to treat the children as special guests and go all out when they come to visit this may cause a separation between you and the children or make the children feel like outsiders instead treat the children like normal members of the family 15 x research source taking the children to special places every time you are together never allows the children a chance to get used to the new family letting them experience everyday situations can help them to get used to the new family arrangement 16 x trustworthy

anticipate some of the more difficult questions imagine if you were a parent what would you want to know about your child s date consider the potential questions and get a general sense of how you would answer them your future education job your background religion childhood education etc your commitment to their child prepare some conversation topics so you don t need to flounder small talk can be difficult and rather than blurting something about the weather it helps to have a few things on hand ask your date about any recent vacations sports teams or other things that their parents like to talk about here are some ideas what was your partner like as a child where are places they ve been what did they think of those places what is their job like bring a gift if you are visiting their house for the first time try a bottle of wine or some flowers this shows that you re thoughtful and it makes a good first impression you can give the gift when you first come in consider whether and when you want to discuss your autism this question depends on how obvious your symptoms are your personal preferences and how hard it is to act neurotypical if it will probably come up it s good to have a brief explanation rehearsed not all people understand what autism is and they may have misconceptions that you ll need to gently correct if you don t want to say you re autistic but have visible symptoms try saying that you have a disability assure them that it s no big deal nobody is entitled to information about your disability only tell them if you want to do so give yourself plenty of time to get ready especially if you have motor skills issues or executive dysfunction it s important to have enough time not to feel rushed take a shower for a minimum of 15 minutes scrub your entire body without skipping any part it might help to scrub everything multiple times just to make sure you scrubbed each part bury your hair with shampoo and rinse it off spend some time on hygiene hair and your face brush your teeth wash your face and apply deodorant then brush your hair and style it if desired facial hair should be shaved or well groomed if you wear makeup stick with what you are good at doing and keep it light get help with your wardrobe remember what your date said about the dress code and ask for specific advice in figuring out how to adhere to it consider asking a fashion conscious loved one for help picking out a fitting outfit for a very casual meeting wear some of your nicer everyday clothes the clothes should be clean and laid back jeans sundresses nice t shirts et cetera for more conservative parents wear the sort of clothes you d wear to church try shirts with collars ties and mid length skirts wear a little jewelry if desired and keep it neat and simple for a very formal outing dress like you would for a wedding or job interview choose your nicest clothes consider an attractive tie or a beautiful dress err on the side of being overdressed being a little overdressed just shows that you want to impress them and is better than being a little underdressed if this happens the parents will probably appreciate the effort keep your outfit modest if you dress femininely you don t know exactly how traditional parents are so unfortunately a low cut top or short skirt may lead to sexist commentary and speculations on how promiscuous you are this doesn t make it okay or your responsibility but it s probably something you want to avoid make sure that your clothing is not see through and that your bra doesn t show avoid showing cleavage or much of your thigh bring a simple stim toy try an elegant tangle toy a stress ball stimmy jewelry or another silent stim toy choose something small enough to fit into a pocket or purse if it s especially attractive or unique it may spark conversation you don t have to mention that you re autistic you can say something like i find that this helps me focus or i like to fiddle with things while i talk and they ll accept the explanation silent tactile stims are the most subtle chew gum if you need something in your mouth hum if you need to stim vocally and use replacement stims if they are comfortable come on time or slightly early if you re on time it shows that you are reliable and that you care giving yourself extra time to get ready will have helped if you show up more than 5 minutes early try driving around the block or hanging out at a nearby park until it s time don t wait in their driveway it will confuse them once you pull up in front of your date s house walk confidently to the front door it s a good idea to not walk through the grass ring the doorbell once and wait quietly greet your date s parents pleasantly smile sweetly and follow the parents lead regarding whether they want to shake hands or hug make eye contact if you re comfortable with it and fake it by looking at their nose eyebrows or chin if you aren t say it s great to finally meet you go inside when you re invited ask whether you should take off your shoes and if so where to put them if you re wearing a jacket take it off and ask where you can hang up your jacket someone may take it for you or you may hang it yourself this is a good time to give them a gift if you brought one give a compliment or two maybe they have a beautiful staircase the dad is an excellent cook or the mother is wearing elegant shoes one or two compliments will show that you appreciate them but won t make you come off as fawning or insincere be your best self it s important to be yourself and it s also important to be on your best behavior say please and thank you use good language and put effort into being respectful and kind work on being authentically good be polite and attentive to your partner offer to pour them drinks or get them things and consider holding the door for them or pulling their chair back for them the parents want to know that you treat their child well and this will help them see that you respect your date placing your an arm around your partner or a hand on their shoulder is generally accepted avoid kissing beyond a quick peck touching in intimate places butt breasts crotch and other public displays of affection in front of the parents find things that you have in common with the parents if they mention liking something that you like talk to them about it this will help you connect over a shared interest here are some things you may have in common sports geographic locations hobbies favorite hangouts music favorite books let them lead the conversation most of the time work on listening well and asking questions that get people to keep talking many people enjoy feeling interesting and important and listening is easier than talking offer to help clean up after a meal at home this is another little way to show how helpful and thoughtful you are maybe you can carry plates to the dishwasher dry the dishes or put things away say goodbye when the visit is over follow the parents lead whether they want to shake hands or hug if you are leaving with your date the parents may tell you when to have them back smile bid your goodbyes and let yourself relax now that it s over the parents will probably watch you leave so open the car door for your partner wait until you both have your seat belts on and then drive away safely,Relationships

reciprocates you ll know that you have his attention introduce yourself somehow and make conversation it s nearly impossible for someone to like you if he doesn t get to know you unless he likes you for all the wrong reasons have a good sense of humor having a good sense of humor makes everything better this doesn t mean you should be a giggling fool laughing at everything that crosses your path but you should try not to take yourself too seriously and always be ready with a laugh especially when your crush is around if you re too serious or straight faced all the time he may find you intimidating and unapproachable which is the last thing you want express your sense of humor in your own way some people are witty and sarcastic others can tell hilarious stories and many people just do quirky things and poke fun at themselves no matter what tickles your sense of humor it s much easier to like someone who you can have a good laugh with once in a while if you don t find something to laugh about together then maybe you ll discover that you don t like him after all make it clear you re available a guy is not going to hit on you if he thinks you re taken so it s your job to make it clear that you are single and ready to mingle if you have a facebook account and he s not already in your friends list invite him just make sure your status is set as single you should also make it obvious in other subtle ways such as hanging out with your girlfriends in a place where you know he ll be dropping subtle hints about not knowing who to go with to an event etc letting your friends in

being in a dedicated relationship 4 x research source treat him like you would all your other friends be casual and comfortable around him guys will usually be more open with guys than girls but that doesn t mean that you can t get close that s usually where the magic happens just be careful though if it gets too platonic you might lose the romantic connection and sometimes it can be really hard to get back that spark once you are placed firmly in the friend zone if this happens things can become too complicated and you might be tempted to give up a little bit of flirtation throughout the relationship will keep things going nicely talk to him this may seem like a no brainer but actually talking to the guy you like rather than pining after him from afar is of utmost importance when it comes to getting him to like you ask him stimulating interesting questions find out about his life his family his friends tell him funny stories anything that opens up a dialogue between the two of you if you can get the guy talking about something he s really passionate about whether it s a favorite sports team band author then you re on to a winner when he s talking to you about something he loves he ll start to associate the positive emotions he feels with you compliment him though this may come as surprise guys love compliments just as much as girls do so don t be afraid to say something nice to him from time to time of course showering him with fake compliments is not a good idea you ll just come off as insincere compliment something about his appearance like his cute dimples or cool new haircut just don t overdo it guys can be shy about that sort of thing a simple i love the color of your eyes is all you need to say however compliments don t just need to be focused on appearance if he s talking about something that he loves tell him that you admire how passionate he is you can also compliment his sporting performance or tell him what a great job he did on a class project 5 x research source do things together finding activities that you can enjoy together can really create a bond between the two of you and allow him to appreciate how fun and interesting you are once he sees that you re someone he can share his passions and interests with he might start to see you as potential relationship material 6 x research source if he thinks of himself as the next premier league player turn up at any football practices you re invited to and cheer him on if he loves rock climbing ask him if he can show you how and make a good faith effort to see why he s so into it have an open mind you can also invite him along to experience some of your interests for instance you could bring him along to a dance class or invite him to try out some unusual ethnic cuisine discovering that you re a person who can introduce him to new and exciting experiences can be a major attraction for a guy find some common interests find out what the two of you have in common and exploit it shared interests are the foundation of many a successful relationship so this step should not be overlooked 7 x research source it doesn t matter what the interest is it could be as simple as the ability to recite lines from family guy episodes or as intense as a fascination with astrophysics as long as it leads him to see you as a kindred spirit for example if you both love a certain kind of music ask him if he s ever listened to a particular artist and offer to play a cd for him or if a mutual favorite band comes to town invite him to go with you get to know his friends guys love their friends so its essential that any potential girlfriend gets along with them for this reason it is extremely worth your time to get to know his friends and let them see you as a cool girl this will let the guy see how easily you could slip into his life no complications no drama if you can get his friends on your team that s a major bonus they will root for you and bring you up around your crush even when you re not there this will ensure that you re always on his mind be careful though you don t want to flirt with his friends this will send conflicting signals and may make you seem like a tease be flirty once the two of you have got to know one another and are frequently hanging out you can start to kick things up a gear show the guy that you re interested in being more than just friends by flirting with him it might be just the sign he s been waiting for to ask you out smile make sure to smile whenever you see the guy this lets him know that you re happy to see him even if he s in a group of people reserve the biggest smile for him make eye contact making eye contact is an essential flirting technique one great tip is to look at him from across the room then once he catches you looking hold his gaze for a moment before smiling and looking away he ll be hooked 8 x research source make physical contact another great flirting technique is to touch the guy in a more than friends kinda way lightly brush his arm when you re talking give him a hug when you greet him or gently mess his hair when you re joking around this will give him the i m interested vibe pretty quickly text him if you have his number if you don t you should ask for it you can text him things throughout the day to let him know you re thinking of him you can send funny or flirty texts and if he replies with the same you ll know you re on the right track for example if he has a sports game or exam coming up you could text to wish him good luck he ll hopefully find this sweet and appreciate the fact that you remembered however you should also be sure not to overdo it remember the rule if you send two consecutive texts without getting a reply you should stop texting it needs to be reciprocal invite him to hang out if the two of you have only been hanging out in group situations or in more formal settings like school or work until now it might be time to invite him somewhere on his own it doesn t need to be a three course dinner in a fancy restaurant it could be something as simple as coffee or the mall if he says yes that s a pretty sure indication that he s interested in you or at least that he really enjoys your company take it as a positive sign and enjoy it just try not to let things get awkward you re just two friends having a good time right if he says no don t freak out too much he may genuinely have another commitment or he may just feel too shy around you to hang out one on one give it some more time then try again if he says no a second time you might have to face the fact that he s not interested tell him you re interested at the end of the day there s only so much waiting around and hoping you can do sometimes your best bet is to tell the guy straight out that you re interested and ask him if he feels the same whatever his response is at least things will be out in the open and you can either move forward with the relationship or move on don t believe the hype about guys having to ask girls out in reality guys love strong confident women who know what they want in fact just the fact that you had the courage to ask might be enough to impress the guy and make him say yes never get someone else to ask a guy out for you it is immature and will increase the chances of the guy saying no even if you re too shy to ask him to his face a text message or handwritten note will be much more effective than the send a friend method have patience these things take time you can t force someone to like you and trying to hurry things up can ruin the courtship altogether give him some space and don t be obsessive let things progress at a natural pace or fade out of natural causes eventually he ll tell you one way or another whether or not he s interested in reciprocating your affection and if he s not don t hang around him like a lost puppy sometimes you might be incompatible in ways that you don t see and sometimes a guy just isn t ready for a long term relationship if this is the case don t waste any time in moving on don t take rejection too personally it happens to everyone at one time or another there are plenty more fish in the sea and as long as you have confidence in yourself you know that you re a good catch and the right guy is out there waiting for you take his feelings into account finally but importantly keep in mind that you cannot control what other people think and do he may be the object of your interest but that does not create any obligation that you be an intimate part of his world turn the situation around if there was some random guy who took an interest in you is there anything that he could do to make you like him probably not the reality is that you will either like him that way or you won t you will find him attractive or not you will find him funny or not all he can do is try to be the best person he can be and hope that you agree the reverse is also true be the best person you can be and let it develop or not from there,Relationships

ask her until you re fairly certain she ll be in a good mood if you notice that she seems sad or angry about something it might not be the best time to ask her out on a date try to catch her after something good happens like if she gets a good grade on a test or gets an interview for a job she wants 3 x research source asking a girl out in person can be nerve wracking to help ease your anxiety set a deadline for yourself and commit to asking her before that date once you start the conversation it ll just take a few minutes to ask her out talk to her when she s by herself so you don t have an audience if a girl is with a group of friends when you try to ask her out she may get embarrassed or not be able to talk openly because she might feel uncomfortable about how many people are

to take a deep breath and calmly ask her on a date say something like would you like to grab a drink at the new coffeehouse this sunday or i d like to get to know you better what do you think about taking our dogs out for a walk something this weekend remember to be direct and confident 6 x research source if you want to do something a little more romantic consider something like having flowers delivered to her house then follow up with her in person and say something like i hope you liked the flowers i sent what do you think about going out this weekend you could also do something a little out of the box like have a pizza delivered to her with a note attached that says something like this is a little cheesy but i d love to go out to dinner with you this weekend respond positively no matter what her answer is in the best case scenario she said yes and you can move on to preparing for your date if she turned you down it s normal to feel a little bummed do your best to not take it personally try to view it as a not the right time not the right person situation and move on as best you can 7 x research source definitely don t try to convince her that she is making a mistake she knows what she wants and trying to make her do something else will make her feel uncomfortable try saying something like no worries i m glad i at least asked and don t have to wonder i hope you have a great day be sincere and try to smile and not sound sarcastic use text or social media if that s how you normally communicate a lot of dates are arranged via text dm social media and in other similar ways when deciding how to ask a girl out pick whichever method feels most natural to your normal way of communicating 8 x research source keep in mind that you ll want to be really clear via text so that your intentions aren t misunderstood pick an activity to ask her to do before you send your message rather than being vague and asking her to just hang out or what she s up to that weekend pick something fun that you think you d both enjoy this gives her something to respond to and you won t be left wondering what to do if she says yes here are some great first date ideas 9 x research source go to an arcade or to play mini golf go to a coffee shop and a used bookstore plan a movie marathon go to an admission free art exhibit or festival volunteer at the local animal shelter to walk and play with the animals make homemade pizza and do a puzzle together keep the text short sweet and specific send her a message that says something simple like hey kate i think you re really cute want to go play arcade games and get something to eat this friday telling her you think she s attractive clues her in that this is a romantic message and not just a friendly one 10 x research source remember to ask about a specific activity for example would you like to go out on a date with me next saturday i thought we could get dinner and go see a movie sounds much more romantic than want to hang out sometime next weekend the latter could be misinterpreted text isn t the only option you could use dms in different social media apps or send a cool video through instagram or snapchat accept her answer and respond quickly even if she turns you down if you get rejected don t wait too long to reply you could say something like that s okay i just wanted to ask i still think you re cool and will see you in class it s not fun to get rejected but it is a normal experience and doesn t mean anything bad about you as a person it s just not the right fit right now 11 x research source if you do get rejected reassure yourself that at least now you know you won t be left wondering what could have happened and you have more practice under your belt for the next time you decide to ask a girl out make plans for your first date if she says yes hopefully you got a positive response to your message firm up the details for the date put it in your calendar and take a few minutes to celebrate how well things went 12 x research source either the day before or the day of your date send her a message letting her know you re looking forward to hanging out find out if she is already dating or interested in someone else you may already know this info but if not it ll come in handy when deciding when or if to ask her out pay attention to the people she talks about often if they aren t regular friends of hers it may be someone she is interested in romantically check out her social media to see if there are any clues there too 13 x research source you could even turn this into an opportunity to get to know her better by asking something like tell me more about some of the people you ve dated or did your last relationship end well check to see if you catch her staring at you when someone looks at your frequently that can often mean that they re interested in you especially if you are already friends this can be a great indicator that she may be developing feelings for you 14 x research source if you don t notice this it doesn t mean that she isn t interested or that you shouldn t ask her out it s just one way you might be able to tell if her feelings toward you have changed observe her body language to tell if she is interested in you or not does she approach you and stand or sit near you does she touch your arm or shoulder these signs may not mean that she likes you romantically but they show that she doesn t dislike you they mean she is comfortable around you and generally likes you as a person this is a great sign 15 x research source your chances of getting a yes when you ask her out are much higher if a girl likes you as a person on the flip side if she avoids you doesn t make eye contact or moves away when you re close by those are clear signs that she doesn t want to spend time with you flirt with her to see if she responds positively make longer than usual eye contact and smile at her touch her gently on the arm or shoulder to make physical contact compliment her looks and her intelligence 16 x research source to compliment a girl you could say something like that sweater brings out the color of your eyes or you did a great job on your presentation today i wish i could speak in front of people like you,Relationships
