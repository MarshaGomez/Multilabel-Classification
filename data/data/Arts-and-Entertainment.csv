how to be talented in multiple areas,setting out to increase your talents and abilities in multiple disciplines is an audacious endeavor it s also very feasible to accomplish in fact it s far easier to become talented in multiple areas than you may expect practicing the skills you wish to improve upon maintaining a positive mindset and broadening your base of interest and knowledge can all help you be talented in all sorts of ways,practice whatever it is you re trying to be talented at you know you have to practice this is especially true if you hope to be talented in multiple areas fortunately you may not need to practice quite as much as you think and can likely make the time to practice multiple skills every day in order to get the most out of the time you put in you have to focus on what you re hoping to learn practice two different skills 40 45 minutes each every day for a month don t worry if you miss a day of practicing one of your talents once in a while if you practice each skill almost every day for a month you ll have put in about 20 hours of focused practice on improving each of the talents you hope to develop 1 x research source deconstruct the talents you hope to acquire in order to practice deliberately and efficiently you need to make sure you are absolutely focused during practice one way to help maximize the efficiency of your practice time is to deconstruct the talents you hope to improve upon into specific skills ask yourself what specifically do you need to be good at in order to be more talented at whatever ability you re developing choose specific objectives to achieve each time you sit down to practice something repeat a small task or process many many times until you ve mastered it 2 x research source for instance if you re trying to improve your ability to play a sport choose an extremely basic aspect of playing that sport and spend 45 minutes straight on just that specific aspect for example if you re hoping to become a better soccer player dribble a soccer ball back and forth on the field with just one foot if you re hoping to improve your talent as a basketball player shoot only lay ups deconstructing your effort to improve one talent will help you improve other talents as well following the sports example doing anything physically active will get you in better shape and improve your coordination both of which will increase your physical abilities generally practice until you can self correct practice enough so that you are able to both notice and correct errors in your execution of a particular ability once you ve completed a disciplined practice routine during which you practice almost daily for a month you will likely reach this point moving forward your practice will become more efficient this is because you have gained a solid base of knowledge from which your talent will more naturally progress for instance if you re hoping to improve your ability to play an instrument practice playing the same single notes or chord so frequently than you automatically know exactly what you did wrong when the sound is even a little bit off be consistent and persistent dabbling and practicing are different things jogging or painting twice a week are fun and healthy things to do but in order to acquire talent you need to be more disciplined in your pursuit of improvement something that may help you be persistent is choosing two very different talents to practice and improve upon during the same time period get in the groove of practicing at the same time of day each day try practicing skills related to two talents you re hoping to improve upon back to back get in the habit of practicing one talent then immediately practicing the other for example right when you get home from a daily run sit down to paint grouping your practice sessions together will encourage you to do both consistently work on two widely different talents to increase the variety of your daily activities following the example used in this step doing something active like running pairs well with something creative and contemplative like painting remove distractions during practice do not rely entirely on willpower to focus adequately during practice time here are a few tips to ensure your practice time is free of interruption set aside a block of time devoted exclusively to practice and commit to practicing for that full length of time set a timer if you d like turn your phone on silent make sure there are no screens running in your vicinity unless you re using them to help you practice if you have music playing consider choosing something without lyrics defy negative thoughts in order to maintain talent in multiple areas train yourself to prevent negative thoughts that can diminish your ability to work towards achieving the multiple goals you set for yourself there are several ways to rid your mind of negative thinking 3 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source overcome fear audacious yes but reflect on what s holding you back the most common barriers to acquiring talent are based on your emotions 4 x research source recognize this and prevent emotional perspectives such as fear from preventing you from pursuing whatever talent you wish to acquire filter out the negative we tend to filter out the positive and be overly concerned with the negative especially in terms of our perspective on our own abilities don t fall for this mental trap contemplate your room for improvement only so far as it motivates you to continue improving recognize the middle ground abandon the concept of perfection don t think that you must be perfect at something to consider yourself talented strengthen your position with positive thinking optimism isn t going to make you good at anything on its own but it will help recognize that it is objectively within your control to decide how to think about something especially goals you set for yourself and your ability to accomplish them respond to negative thoughts that arise by re framing them in equally true but more positive perspectives for instance 5 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source instead of thinking i ve never done this before and it seems hard think here s an opportunity to learn and there are a few different ways to approach this instead of thinking i m too lazy or there s no way i can do that tell yourself i haven t put enough time into this but i can at least try it and see how it goes finally don t get discouraged by thoughts about how slowly your talents are improving decide to tell yourself that it s worth one more try practice the thinking part too even convincing yourself to favor positive thinking takes practice it will pay off though become less critical of the world around you and of yourself simply by repeating positive sentiments to yourself and pushing away negative thoughts maintaining a positive mindset will not only improve your mood but will help motivate you to stick with the hard work required to acquire new talents 6 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source monitor your progress know that focused practice will not always be fun realizing the development of your talents however will be take note of and appreciate your achievements such as a new personal record mile time or a particularly compelling painting if there are tangible indications of your progress perhaps especially paintings place them in locations you will frequently see them in order to motivate yourself to continue practicing and improving upon your talents rest keep your mind and body ready to practice with focus and energy more to the point rest strategically if the talent you re trying to improve requires intense physical activity or mental focus you re going to have to keep your mind and body conditioned enough to practice effectively 7 x research source this may actually require that you do take off one day a week this is important to do if it improves your ability to practice effectively for the rest of the week accept that innate skill is less significant than practice and perseverance even the abilities some people seem to be born with come more from training than from inborn talent 8 x research source this is true for athletes musicians and mathematicians know you ll need some grit psychologists have come to use the term grit when referring to an attribute held by successful people grit indicates both perseverance and passion in pursuing long term goals 9 x research source overcoming adversity in pursuit of developing your skills also positively contributes to improve your talents more generally when facing challenges that others might not have to deal with tell yourself that by overcoming them you ll have a step up on everyone else improve upon talents that interest you even scientists aren t sure about how to increase talent the question of how we become good at things is still largely unanswered we do know that people who are exposed to things that they become drawn to naturally and who then become immersed in those things end up being good at them with training and practice people who are already into something become especially good at it accept the significance of these findings and act accordingly 10 x research source observe and play without inhibition inspiration and curiosity will inevitably hit you and you ll end up pursuing talents you ll be interested in enough to stick with ignore the technical aspects of the talent you re hoping to acquire you can bring in the technical aspects of perfecting your abilities once you re committed don t try to judge where your interests are coming from avoiding these tendencies will allow your more creative and emotional aspirations to get you hooked on something read reading is a great place to start learning about how you can become more talented in multiple ways one of the main benefits here is perking your curiosity and motivating yourself to pursue new ways to expand your talents or to pursue new talents altogether becoming interested in something you ve read is seen as an indication that you may take especially well to the material 11 x research source if you become interested in something new throw yourself at it there are literal advantages to reading too you learn about language and writing about whatever era of history is relevant to the book and of course about the content contained in the book you re immediately more knowledgeable about all sorts of stuff just by dragging your eyes back and forth across a page and interpreting a bunch of printed words of course nothing compares to hands on experience whatever you read about that appeals to you practice doing it yourself and develop a new talent,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to people watch,people watching is an art in some cultures in old cities like paris flâneurs the french word for someone who strolls or lounges used to explore the urban landscape at a slow and leisurely pace some people watch others for artistic inspiration while others simply do it for pleasure whatever your reasons for people watching remember to always be polite if your presence is making someone uncomfortable be sure to respect their space and privacy no matter where you live you too can practice the art of people watching and find endless inspiration in the shared spaces of your community,find a crowded street cafe cafes are a classic people watching destination many people visit coffee shops and outdoor bars restaurants and there will almost always be something interesting going on at these destinations 1 x research source cafes tend to draw both locals and tourists giving you an interesting blend of people and personalities many people think of cafes as an excellent meeting place to get together and hold conversations you can eavesdrop on what people are saying and gather fascinating and true stories from people s lives if it s cold or wet outside you can people watch inside a cafe but cafes with outdoor patios let you surround yourself with conversations while also witnessing strangers pass by on the street choose a park bench parks tend to draw a lot of people especially in large urban areas visiting a park offers an escape from the hectic nature of city life providing city dwellers with a serene natural environment 2 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source people tend to feel relaxed in parks which makes a park a great place to watch people interact when they feel most comfortable though a park may have intermittent moments of silence it will most likely have steady waves of people passing through over time 3 x research source parks tend to draw people of all demographics the young middle aged and elderly families and single people alike visit a bustling tourist attraction tourist attractions tend to draw people who visit from all over the world yet they also draw a large number of locals people are often hurrying to and from the various tourist attractions in a given city so it can create a bustling energetic atmosphere that is great for watching or even interacting with strangers 4 x research source take note of the things people photograph at a given tourist attraction you may even want to spark up a conversation with tourists asking questions like what drew you to this location in the city and what does it mean to you tourist attractions tend to have a steady stream of people entering and leaving which means that if you sit or walk around for any length of time you ll see a perpetually changing crowd of people explore an urban square or plaza in older cities the square or plaza was an historic gathering place for locals to meet and exchange ideas or commerce 5 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source today urban squares plazas tend to be little parks or simply an open space within the city a square or plaza is an excellent place to watch locals rushing to or from work on their lunch breaks as well as visitors from out of town who are trying to take in the city if you live in an urban area any square or plaza in your city will most likely be bustling and crowded especially during work hours on weekdays and mornings afternoons on weekends go to a pedestrian street pedestrian streets also called pedestrian malls are stretches of city streets that have been closed to vehicular traffic some are temporary intermittent pedestrian streets while others are closed to vehicles all of the time 6 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source pedestrian streets are usually lined with cafes bars restaurants and little shops these types of locations tend to draw a lot of traffic whether people are visiting specific locations or simply taking in the environment like you don t be surprised if you see a lot of other people watchers on a pedestrian street if you don t live near a pedestrian street you can try your local mall malls foster a similar atmosphere and tend to draw a lot of people ride public transportation for some people public transportation naturally encourages conversations and interactions 7 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source if you re lost or unsure of which connecting subway line you ll need you would naturally ask someone who knows the city public transportation offers a perpetually shifting demographic of the city s residents and tourists alike 8 x research source most people enter and leave public transportation based on their neighborhoods and their destinations by noting where the most people exit a subway or bus you can get a good idea of which parts of the city hold the most common destinations walk around extensively some of the earliest people watchers walked extensively across their cities many of these flâneurs were writers and artists seeking inspiration by observing people while others simply found pleasure in taking in the faces and wardrobes that were encountered 9 x research source walking gives you the advantage of an ever changing crowd of people to watch coupled with the changing scenery and atmospheres as you walk from one neighborhood to the next walking may be more ideal for people watching destinations like urban plazas or tourist attractions people watching while you walk can help you get some exercise enjoy a little fresh air and see parts of the community that you might not otherwise visit sit in one place if walking isn t an option or if you get tired while exploring the city on foot you can always sit and watch people pass you by the advantage of sitting is that you still experience a constant stream of passersby while being able to take it in more fully if you are sitting while you people watch it s easier to take photographs or jot notes on the people you see people watching while sitting is much easier than walking if you re interested in experiencing a city s cafes bars restaurants or public transportation look distracted one risk of people watching is that others will notice you if you re just walking around a city this shouldn t be a problem but some people fear being watched by others and may ask you what you re doing for this reason if you plan on sitting while people watching you may want to look distracted in some capacity so that others do not feel threatened or uncomfortable try drinking coffee or a cocktail at a cafe or bar if you re sitting outside glance down periodically at an open book or newspaper to look like you have no interest in what people are saying or doing around you 10 x research source many people like to take notes or draw based on the people and things they see and hear if you have a notebook that s fine but typing on a laptop or in your mobile phone s note taking application can help you remain discreet 11 x research source be appropriate there are places and people that you should not watch such as daycare centers schools and government buildings standing around watching people at these types of locations may arise suspicion and someone may call the police make sure you are not in a no loitering area or the police might be watching you stay away from private property and instead stick to public spaces if someone asks you to leave or tells you that you re making them uncomfortable be respectful and apologize then walk away respect people s privacy and their personal space don t be intrusive and don t get up close to others unless you re moving through a crowded area and it is unavoidable never photograph someone without getting that individual s permission first take note of identity one of the easiest things to learn about others from people watching is how certain individuals identify themselves clothing is rarely ever just clothes most people use their clothing to convey a certain image a particular style or to identify as a member of a culture or subculture 12 x research source sports merchandise suggests a strong affiliation with that team s city region university or country look for jerseys caps or t shirts and try to identify what a given team represents to that individual t shirts or sewn on patches of a band s logo let you know that that person listens to that band s music and identifies with the scene they represent any band might print t shirts but patches are often associated with grunge and punk rock designer brand clothing indicates that fashion is important to that individual these individuals may or may not be wealthy but it s safe to assume that these people put a lot of thought into how they dress souvenir shirts and hats tell you where a person has been whether the individual likes to travel and what things are important in that person s social life for example disneyland shirts might imply an emphasis on family tattoos may honor a loved one in which case family is important to them a military squadron national pride and duty or a city s skyline home or a place identified as home try to interpret how a tattoo might represent that person s identity make inferences about self esteem in addition to style of dress you can learn a great deal about a person by how that individual carries himself or herself look at a person s posture the way that individual walks and the way he or she interacts with or avoids other people on the street to determine how confident or shy a person is as well as how kind or selfish that individual might be 13 x research source good posture with a straight back and shoulders pushed back implies that a person is very strong and secure this person may or may not be smiling but is certainly confident in himself herself at the moment if you see someone slouched over and staring at the ground to avoid eye contact or looking back over his her shoulder that individual is probably very insecure or self doubting there s nothing wrong with looking good of course but being perfectly groomed and manicured as well as stopping to look in every mirror are the common marks of a narcissist 14 x research source guess at people s emotional states determining someone s emotional state without actually interacting with that person entails a bit more guess work than inferring that individual s self esteem or identity there is no universal guide to emotions as some people laugh when they are stressed out or cry when they are happy however generally speaking you can make an educated guess about someone s emotional state by the way that person behaves in public 15 x research source anxious people tend to fidget shrug shoulders and look around nervously someone who looks sad or is crying is most likely sad or depressed though again you can t be certain without interacting with a person a furrowed brow and or narrow eyes usually implies anger or frustration an individual who walks briskly and has some indication of a smile on his or her face is probably happy or having a good day draw conclusions about people s personalities you can tell a lot about a person s general personality traits based on the way that person moves through his or her environment the easiest things to spot might be kindness versus selfishness but there are many other facets of a person s personality that become evident if you watch for long enough 16 x research source a kind caring person will let you pass ahead or will hold a door open for strangers someone who sees another person coming but lets the door close in that person s face is probably not a particularly nice individual though that person may just be running late or impatient someone who makes eye contact with others and smiles is probably a very friendly outgoing individual by contrast someone who makes eye contact while maintaining a cold demeanor may have an unfriendly or gruff personality you can learn just as much about a person by his her interactions with others as you can from someone s reluctance to interact with others 17 x research source take note of the ways people interact with or avoid one another whether they re together in a group or strangers passing by one another,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to make illuminated manuscripts,in the middle ages all books were written by hand which meant the images were painted by hand too illuminated manuscripts gained popularity in the 12th century when

source you can find parchment at most craft or paper supply stores traditionally parchment was also dusted with pumice powder to roughen the surface and make it receptive to ink and paint if you can t find any parchment just use thick white cardstock instead trim the end of a quill so you can write with it traditionally illuminated manuscripts were written in with feather quills from ducks geese or chickens grab one of these dried quills and use scissors or a knife to cut the tip into a fine point so you can write with it 2 x research source you can find quills at most paper supply stores if you don t have a quill you can use just grab a fountain pen with black ink instead dip the quill s pointed tip into black ink pour a small amount of black ink into a bowl so you can access it easily when

long you want your story to be and then pick out the pages you d like to use 4 x research source in traditional manuscripts the images were much larger than the words on the pages in most illuminated manuscripts the first letter of each page was much larger and more detailed than the rest you can start on that letter first or leave room to do it later copy an adventure or story from the middle ages or write your own traditionally illuminated manuscripts depicted fanciful events like adventure stories and heroic knights to stick with these themes you can either copy an existing story like king arthur and the round table or you can make one up on your own 5 x research source consider writing out the text on a scrap piece of paper as a practice before you put it onto your manuscript

as neat as possible as you ink out your letters and try to make them as fancy looking as possible 6 x research source if you can t do calligraphy that s okay too just use your neatest cursive handwriting to keep your letters clean and sharp looking let the ink dry for about 15 minutes black ink takes a while to dry especially on parchment paper before you move on with your manuscript spread the pages of text out on a flat surface and leave them to dry completely 7 x research source to avoid smudging the ink as you write keep your hand up off the paper when you hold your quill sketch your images and designs with a quill and ink before you add color to your pages use the same quill and black ink to mark out the design you d like to draw so you know where to add color on the page try drawing scenes from the story you wrote out in calligraphy to add visual images to your manuscript let the ink dry for about 10 minutes before you move on 8 x research source classic

areas of your design that you d like to press gold leaf onto then gently paint the base coat on those areas try not to get it outside the lines or it could dilute the paint you use later on 10 x research source traditional base coats were made of plaster but you can find base coats at most craft supply stores press the gold leaf onto your design grab a sheet of gold leaf with tweezers and carefully press it onto the areas that have a base coat on them use a fluffy paint brush to brush away the excess gold leaf then press the remaining gold leaf down onto the page so it really sticks 11 x research source gold leaf is a thin sheet of real gold that you can manipulate using a paint brush it s great for adding a regal border or angelic lighting to an image gold leaf adds the illumination to your images that gives these manuscripts their name traditionally gold leaf was added to window panes and fruits in the background of images if you re doing a craft with your kids you can use gold glitter paint instead add color to your designs with watercolor paint pick out the colors that you d like to use for the rest of your image try to use watercolors as they best reflect the traditional vegetable dyed colors of the middle ages use a small paint brush to dab color into the areas of your design to fill in the rest of the visual then let the paint dry for about 15 minutes 12 x research source if you re doing this as a craft project with your kids let them use glitter glue or brightly colored paint to fill in their images classic illuminated manuscripts used vegetable dyed paint meaning they had a limited range of colors to stick to the classic look try to use light greens purples deep reds and burnt oranges you can use white or tan paint to add highlights to your figures and objects as well gather the pages in the correct order once all your pages are dry collect them in the order that you d like them to go make sure they are all cut to the same size and that there isn t anything missing from your text 13 x research source classic manuscripts had folded pieces of parchments called gatherings but you don t have to use that for yours press the spine of the pages against 3 narrow leather thongs line the left side of the pages up against 3 narrow leather thongs and spread the thongs lengthwise across the spine of the book these thongs will hold the pages of your manuscript together so they should be slightly wider than the group of pages 14 x research source you can find leather thongs at most craft supply stores if you can t find any leather thongs you can use synthetic ones instead sew the pages onto the thongs with linen thread thread a needle with thick linen thread and tie the end in a knot use the linen thread to go in through the top of the pages then out through the top of one leather thong keep going until you ve attached all of the pages to all 3 of the thongs in a straight line 15 x research source if you have a lot of pages in your manuscript this can be tough to do try working in sections to get all of the pages attached in the same way loop the leather thongs through wooden boards grab 2 wooden boards that are slightly larger than the pages of your manuscript line up the boards on your pages then mark where the ends of the leather thongs fall on the boards use a chisel to pop out 3 holes in each board for the thongs then pull the thongs through the holes and tie them off 16 x research source if there s excess leather sticking out of the book you can use scissors or a knife to cut it off you can use any kind of

letter in your portfolio draft a brief but interesting letter that describes both you as an artist as well as your art style provide a brief engaging explanation of why you re reaching out to the

with the gallery s artistic preferences you may want to take your business somewhere else 8 x research source for instance if you create a lot of abstract paintings you won t want to submit your art to a gallery that sells realistic landscape paintings some galleries may not have their works posted online in this case you may want to scope out the business in person send a basic email if you want

personalized as possible so your query stands out from other artists 9 x research source for instance you can say something like this greetings my name is andrew nelson and i ve been making oil paintings for the past 5 years i truly admire the solid sense of identity that this gallery has in their oil paintings and i d love to schedule an appointment with you this type of communication is

to see if they have any exhibits or other events in the coming weeks and months make an effort to attend these events and speak with the gallery owners and curators don t focus on selling yourself as an artist instead focus on developing a positive friendly relationship with these people 12 x research source it s a lot easier to get your foot in the door if you re on good terms with the gallerists

into it may help you stand out from the crowd 13 x research source read the gallery s submission criteria before sending in your art check online and ask in person to see what materials you need to submit the gallerists there s no hard and fast rule for this application process some gallerists prefer hard copies of your portfolio while others may prefer something more digital double check the exact submission requirements before sending your work in 14 x research source don t try to be an overachiever if a gallery asks for 15 samples just send 15 they re probably getting a lot of applications and don t have time to look through 50 different samples of your art some galleries may not have submissions open if this is the case respect their wishes and don t send in any unsolicited art samples ask if you can schedule an appointment with a gallerist call or visit the gallery in person and ask to speak with a gallerist express your interest in working with the gallery and ask if you can meet with them to discuss possible opportunities 15 x research source for instance you can say something like good morning do you accept in person appointments for prospective gallery artists even if the gallerists aren t willing to meet with you they may suggest some galleries that are looking for new talent give a 20 minute presentation that describes your art process don t waste your appointment time with small talk instead discuss your identity as an artist along with the creative process that you use if you re working on a collection or series describe your plans for it 16 x research source for example you can say something like i m currently working on an abstract portrait series that represents each horoscope sign these paintings represent a collective sense of human identity and i hope to be finished with them within the next 2 months you can really set your presentation apart by offering the gallerist small refreshments show recent samples of your art with an updated portfolio only include artwork that you ve made within the past few weeks or months whether you re submitting your portfolio to the gallery or presenting it during an in person appointment gallerists want to see what you re capable of now not what you were working on 6 years ago 17 x research source if you don t have any recent art galleries probably won t want to work with you pay the required commission fees if you re accepted in a gallery keep in mind that most galleries will pocket at least 40 of your art s commission don t make a fuss about this or try to increase your selling prices consider the commission payment as a price for exposure 18 x research source don t try to raise your prices after hearing the gallery s commission costs as this is pretty

how to read ulysses,come on it s ulysses considered by many to be the second hardest book in the english language mostly because the hardest book in the english language requires a working knowledge of 8 other languages to read reading ulysses is both enjoyable and provocative despite its reputation it s not too difficult to read,understand ulysses before learning how to read ulysses you have to know what you re getting into ulysses comprises 18 episodes each of these episodes was serialized separately and each one reads completely differently for example episode 14 parodies all of the great authors of the english language going from chaucer to dickens and episode 18 is a lengthy monologue of about 10 000 words that comprises two giant run on sentences every episode reads like a completely different book and therein lies the beauty of ulysses don t use a guidebook when doing a formal academic study of ulysses you should buy some form of guidebook these books are about four hundred pages thick and explain ulysses line by line this is good because ulysses is full of esoteric puns and references and the guidebooks explain it all however switching from guidebook to guidebook over and over is very annoying the best way to read ulysses if you re trying to read it for fun is to just dive right in saving all of those guidebooks for a college course 1 x research source understand that it s funny no really this seven hundred page text is hilarious the entire idea of the novel is that joyce is taking the epic heroes of the odyssey and turning them into these pathetic dubliners the end of episode 4 features a ten page poop joke written in the same elevated language as the odyssey understanding that every sentence has some form of joke in it be it some esoteric reference to literature or a subtle pun turns ulysses into a very intelligent comedy 2 x research source you re not going to understand everything but that s mostly because joyce designed it that way part of the joke is that you re not going to get everything and there s humor in that laugh whenever you don t get something because you ve just walked into one of the most brilliant

catechism episode 3 elitist masculine monologue episode 4 poking fun at great historic heroes episode 5 the hypnotic nature of religion episode 6 death episode 7 making fun of journalism it s written like a newspaper pay attention to the headlines episode 8 food puns everything can be eaten and everything eats in this chapter episode 9 making fun of hamlet and elitists who debate over obscure pieces of literature in particular making fun of certain scholars who would later analyze ulysses episode 10 this chapter has nothing to do with the main characters it is instead presented as a series of short stories surrounding the side characters the humor is that it is in fact largely pointless and that most of the side characters make fun of the main characters episode 11 everything is a music pun a lot of onomatopoeia is used episode 12 there are two narrators one is hyper colloquial to the point of not making sense and one is hyper scientific to the point of not making sense the competition between the narrators produces the comedy episode 13 narrated by a young girl and everything is a sex joke episode 14 an elaborate parody of all the great english authors episode 15 written as a hallucinatory play in a red light district episode 16 this chapter is very ambiguous and the comedy comes from mistaking characters for other characters episode 17 written as a catechism the comedy comes from the hyper scientific question and answer format being applied to the mundane episode 18 streaming consciousness of bloom s wife use the schemas joyce wrote two graphic organizers

agent for your career once you have the name of a client or agency you can search for them directly start local if you are just getting started in the entertainment business it will be more difficult to get signed by a big talent agency smaller more local agencies may be just as good for getting your foot in the door getting gigs on your resume and paving the way for bigger representation later 11 x research source target a specific agent in an agency you don t want to send an impersonal letter to the whole agency instead try to target one agent who you think you would work well with and may have the background to help you advance your career 12 x research source do not contact multiple people in the same agency as that will make you appear desperate and unprofessional study the agent s affiliations when you start researching an agent examine the groups she is connected with and any licenses she has this can be a good way for you to make sure the person you are dealing with has the right connections and background plus if she is tied to other groups like a performers union the union can provide additional information 13 x research source some more prominent professional trade groups for agents include the ata and the national association of talent representatives in addition try focusing your attention on agencies that have experience in the field you want to work in for instance if you want to be on broadway you might look for agencies that specialize in theater actors 14 x expert source martin bentsen acting coach headshot photographer expert interview 8 may 2020 write a cover letter this is a professional business so you will need to act professionally when contacting agencies make sure your package has a brief cover letter that discusses your experience and interest in being represented by that agency one page should be enough 15 x research source make your letter specific one you find an agent to send your materials to tailor your letter to address her directly be sure to explain not just why you would be good for her agency but her in particular of course be careful to take care of little details like spelling the agent s name correctly 16 x research source send a follow up email agents are busy people who receive many letters every day and may not be able to respond if you haven t heard anything back including a rejection send a follow up note this is a good way to help your name rise above the pile and make it more likely you get a response from the agency 17 x research source your note should be brief more of a reminder a simple email saying i just wanted to check and see if you had a minute to look over my submission gives the agent something to look for if you are lucky the agent may respond without prompting in most cases though if you have not heard anything for two weeks it is probably best to send a follow up reminder 18 x research source arrive early aim to arrive at the agency about 5 10 minutes before your scheduled interview this can give you a few minutes to use the restroom and settle your thoughts before heading int you ll also get a buffer of time in case you get held up for any reason on the way over 19 x research source bring your materials make sure you have copies of whatever you sent in when you first contacted the agency in addition keep an eye on specific things the agent asks for before the interview if he asked for them he will expect to see them and it will look very bad if you are unprepared 20 x research source while your website is great for publicity don t direct the agent there during your interview if there is something important on there make sure you have a copy ready with you for the interview if this includes some kind of audio or video file make sure you have a way to present it without having to connect to your website dress properly dress for your interview should be smart casual you are in the entertainment business not finance you don t need to dress like you are going to a board meeting the important thing is to avoid looking sloppy 21 x research source for men there is no need to wear a tie while women should skip business wear keep your wardrobe to a clean nice looking suit be smart too if you are going to need to move around for your interview say if you are a dancer make sure you have clothes that will allow you to do that be prepared for an audition meeting with the agent is as much of an audition as any other prepare your best material for when you get that call to go sit with an agent the more variety you can get to your prepared auditions the more flexible you can be to find something enjoyable or appropriate to demonstrate 22 x research source for actors it s good to have 2 3 monologues ready to go make sure they are cover a variety of styles such as dramatic classical and comedic to show off the full range of your skills 23 x research source for a field like modeling this is where you should have a variety of your photos present to demonstrate your versatility be prepared with a swimsuit or something else that will let the agency get a good look at your body 24 x research source prepare your own questions when you talk to the agency it is good to have a few questions of your own ask about other clients the agency represents the kind of work the agency has gotten its clients and what kinds of expectations they would have for you 25 x research source the interview is also to make sure you are comfortable working with this agent don t be afraid to ask a few questions to learn about what he thinks of your work and career and where he sees you going professionally you re going to need to rely on your agent for career advice so it needs to be someone you feel comfortable opening up to when you speak,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to clap your hands,it s true babies do it and well but clapping is more diverse than you might think is it appropriate to clap your hands after the allegro passage in a mozart concerto what about after a sermon in church and what s the deal with snapping at a poetry reading learn to clap the right way,do the basic clap open your hands and clap your palms against each other with the fingers held up towards the sky do it hard enough to get a good loud smacking sound out of it but not so hard you turn your hand red some people clap more by clapping the fingers of one hand against the palm of the other do whatever feels most comfortable for you do the royalty clap you know when the queen comes out of the castle and deigns to applaud her loyal subjects with a brief applause that s what you re going for a demure clap can be done just by clapping with the first two fingers tapping them into your palm it should make very little noise giving the impression that you re clapping more than actually contributing to the group clap without your hands not all cultures or situations call for hand on hand clapping learn to use other types of claps so you ll be prepared to celebrate in all situations stomping your feet is a common way of applauding at some camps and in some sporting events it makes more of a thunderous rumble that can be quite intimidating and fun rapping your knuckles on the table after a lecture used to be common in some boarding schools as opposed to clapping to snap or not to snap the cliché that beret wearing hipsters snap at each others poems at jazzy cafes is a cliché based on an out of date 1940s stereotype if you snap your fingers at a poetry reading you ll probably be the only one it s like yelling freebird at a rock concert 1 x research source clap silently in situations in which it s inappropriate to made noise or when the audience is primarily hearing impaired or deaf the general way of clapping is to raise your hands with your palms facing away from you and to wiggle your fingers sometimes called sparkling this is also used to agree or to support a speaker during meetings of consensus quaker meetings or other events during which speaking out is not allowed do the slow clap a slow clap starts and builds gradually into a roar of applause to start a slow clap begin clapping no more than once every two seconds and gradually wait for others to build and join in with you gradually speed up slow clapping can often mean a variety of things traditionally a slow clap was considered a kind of heckle instead of a celebration though now it s considered a kind of winking or ironic celebration of something dramatic epic you might slow clap your little brother after he finally cleans his bedroom for instance wait to clap until you hear clapping clapping can be a great way of showing your appreciation but it can also be rude if you clap at the wrong time in certain situations it ll be obvious when to clap but other times are more ambiguous not sure when to clap the best way to avoid an awkward situation is to wait to clap until you hear applause then join in use the volume of people clapping around you to keep your volume at an appropriate level match your style of clapping to the rest of the crowd is it appropriate to clap after a soloist at church after a good movie after a solo during a concert it ll change in every situation go with what happens around you clap to celebrate excellent performances the most common purpose and moment for applause is when something great has just happened in public that deserves celebrating speeches athletic events and concerts are all common places to clap points in athletic competition or great plays are often rewarded with clapping and applause in many cultures in others overly dramatic displays of emotion are somewhat looked down on but if people are clapping it s probably a safe bet that you won t be glared at most people clap after songs at a pop music concert of any kind as well as when performers come to and leave the stage at public speaking events it s common to welcome a speaker to the stage and congratulate them at the end of a speech or performance depending on the occasion it s usually uncommon to clap in the middle of most performances unless directed by the performer sometimes accompanying clapping might be requested or to give a hand to someone present follow instructions stop clapping when it starts to taper off as soon as the clapping starts to die down it s ok to stop clapping clapping isn t a chance to interrupt a performance it s a chance to celebrate it get quiet with the crowd and don t act silly clap at the end of a concert to request an encore it s also common to clap as a part of audience participation at some music events or concerts if the performance was particularly great continue clapping and try to prompt the performer to come back out for one more song or routine at the very least you might get another bow as long as you re tactful clapping with the beat is a common occurrence at many concerts applaud if you re being applauded if for some reason you re on stage being celebrated clapping along with everyone else can be a nice humble looking maneuver done properly bow your head to acknowledge the thanks then start clapping with everyone else if it goes on too long give the cut sign and start your thank yous always thank an audience for any applause that you receive it s also common to prompt applause for other people present if for example you re giving a big speech and your thesis advisor is present you might want to recognize her for applause be careful when clapping during classical music the rules about clapping during classical performances will depend on the venue the group of musicians playing the director and the piece it s usually only common to applaud in between individual pieces and in some cases in between particular movements of a longer piece in some cases it s only appropriate to clap to welcome the performer to the stage and to clap at the end of the performance refer to the program for specific instructions regarding clapping or wait to clap until you hear other people clapping to be sure it used to be common in the age of mozart for crowds to be more disruptive particularly moving passages would cause audiences to break into applause while the musicians were still playing many people attribute the newer attitude regarding applause to wagner who s direction to avoid curtain calls for parsifal is thought to have confused some concert goers into thinking that absolute silence was essential 2 x research source clap after music at some churches traditionally choral music is not applauded and is to be appreciated in rapt and contemplative silence at more modern praise churches on the other hand it s very common to applaud the performance after its given at pentecostal churches clapping is pretty much part of the sermon every church will be different so be observant and go with the flow don t be the first to clap at church but join in if you hear the joyful sound,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to read a long chapter book in two or three hours,it s fun to read for pleasure but sometimes you don t have the ability to choose how much time you get to read a book if you need to read a book and only have 2 or 3 hours to do so you can still get through it with some good preparation ahead of time as you ll see preparing to read quickly is just as important as reading itself,look at the text ahead of time first look at the table of contents take note of how many chapters or sections there are and how many pages are in each flip through the book and take notes of charts pictures or subsections take a stab at what the book will cover ahead of time this will assist with active reading later 1 x research source calculate how long you should spend on each section for example if there are fifteen chapters and you have three hours you should divide 180 60 minutes x 3 by fifteen in this example each chapter will take on average 12 minutes whatever the amount of time you calculate this is not a hard and fast time it is just a tool to help you keep track of your time and progress you need to factor in times for breaks and also understand that some chapters will take longer amount of time and some will take a shorter amount of time to complete review what your goals are knowing your goals will help you pay attention to the right things and not waste time on irrelevant aspects of the book 2 x research source 3 x research source are you going to be quizzed on the material are you trying to learn a specific skill from the pages are you supposed to be paying attention to certain aspects of the book a character the way the author uses language etc knowing exactly what you need to get out of the reading will help you focus on what s important and not waste time reading and retaining something immaterial to your goal use a guide or pointer whether you use your finger a piece of a paper a bookmark or a pen a pointer will help guide how much you read 4 x research source hold it up to the word or line of text and move it as you complete reading 5 x research source sometimes you will want to read faster sometimes you will want to read slower the more you use it the more it will guide how quickly you can read be an active reader don t wait for the story to come to you anticipate what is going to happen and what you need to retain and look for those whether they are facts plot points or important themes 6 x research source 7 x research source scan for important words instead of reading every sentence let your eyes grab onto the major words after time you will find that you can take in the bigger meaning of the paragraph with just these few words you can always quickly rescan if you want to retain more information 8 x research source relax your face don t let your eye take in every word instead of your eye tracking every single word take advantage of your peripheral vision to see what is coming ahead of time begin to see text as a group of words that you can take in all at once 9 x research source stop subvocalization subvocalization is when you see a word and then think the entire word in your head if you stop doing this you will save a lot of time while reading in order to turn off this part of your mind you can occupy it with something else like you can chew gum counting from one to ten over and over again or keep repeating a e i o u in your head 10 x research source 11 x research source learn speed reading speed reading is a specific skill that takes practice and dedication there are many apps and books you can get to help you do this but it might not be worth it if you need to read a chapter book in 2 3 hours today keep in mind that sometimes speed reading can affect your comprehension so there is a trade off 12 x research source know when to stop skimming and start reading occasionally you will come across an important part of the book at these places it is important to stop skimming and read more deeply so you will retain more reading an important part closely is as important as reading a lot of parts not closely if you can tell it is an important part of the book you may want to mark it with a pen highlighter pencil bookmark or turning the page down 13 x research source schedule your reading session instead of squeezing your reading time into an already full day set aside in 2 3 hours of reading like it was an activity or event you need to show up at 14 x research source by dedicating specific time to reading you will limit distractions and interferences 15 x research source choose a quiet environment you will want to read in a quiet place with no distractions not a convivial area where you might begin a conversation or get distracted by conversations around you 16 x research

kitchen 17 x research source make yourself comfortable because you will be in one place for several hours you will want to make sure you are not in pain and will remain comfortable for a long amounts of time pay attention to your posture make sure the lighting is good so you will not strain your eyes make sure you have lower back support either from a chair a pillow or a rolled up sweatshirt 18 x research source avoid distractions it will be very tempting to put down the book and do something else you must resist these distractions and plan for them ahead of time turn off your phone stay away from a computer handheld device video games or television 19 x research source even food can be a distraction make sure you have eaten ahead of time or have a snack on hand so that you will not get up and go somewhere else be awake and alert if you are reading in a short amount of time you will need to stay focused you should read the book during the time of day you feel most alert 20 x research

opportunities for electronic transmission of sight and sound storytelling sometimes seems like a dead art in fact there are significant opportunities for someone who wants to become a professional storyteller,volunteer your storytelling ability whenever you can often the beginning of a professional storytelling career involves many free performances at public events by volunteering at a local library community day care cafe charity or other venue an amateur storyteller can gain the experience needed to perfect their craft and transition into becoming a professional storyteller as the old saying goes practice makes perfect start a storytelling club or event if you don t have many events or storytelling venues near you take the initiative and found your own propose the idea to start a public storytelling hour to your local library or coffee shop give your story event a theme for instance you might open the event up for proposals pertaining to specific themes like romance adventures on the sea or troubles with technology 1 x research source don t make your theme too specific for instance a theme like my first date might get a lot of similar stories and be boring for the audience set a time limit so you don t get stories that are too long and rambling ten minutes is usually a good limit for the average story alternately you could just get your closest friends together in your living room on a friday or saturday night and swap stories in a semi structured way you could select a specific theme or you could just provide an open forum for sharing stories storycorps is a podcast which attempts to preserve and share humanity s stories in order to build connections between people and create a more just and compassionate world 2 x research source for the hefty sum of 3 500 per day you can host a storycorps event in your community you might consider soliciting public funding or private fundraising to help with the fee interviews can last forty minutes and are added to the library of congress archives they are also available online 3 x research source start your own podcast a podcast is a streaming or downloadable audio interview podcasts are a great format for telling your own story or those of others with some editing you can incorporate music into your podcast too your podcast can be narrow stories in the history of astronomy or broad stories from around the world in focus podcasts can be hard to produce get help from a trained sound engineer to record and produce your podcast as you build your audience seek local businesses for financial support offer them advertising space on your podcast 4 x research source while you can easily do a simple podcast on your home computer with your built in microphone and recording software a good podcast will

users adobe audition is a useful program for editing purposes attend storytelling clubs and festivals storyteller groups host festivals all over the country whether you attend festivals or conferences as a participant or as a member of the audience take advantage of the opportunity to hear other storytellers to hone your own craft and inspire you to find new stories of your own conferences are great opportunities to perform or engage in professional development the largest festival the national storytelling festival takes place each year in tennessee 6 x research source check the national storytelling network s calendar at https storynet org calendar to search for storytelling events in your area read a lot read both fiction and nonfiction in a conscious way thinking about what made a given story memorable memoirs are especially useful for helping you think about how to frame your personal experience and regurgitate it as a great story read storytelling guides to improve your delivery learn how to pace your story and understand what makes a story great 7 x research source while you might intuitively understand some or all of these storytelling elements already explicitly recognizing how these elements work in conversation with each other will hone your storytelling skills you probably have lots of questions and issues about becoming a professional storyteller that someone else has already dealt with learn from their experiences avoid their pitfalls and adopt their paths to success solicit feedback don t get feedback from any random audience member get feedback from people who are professional orators actors writers and storytellers ask them what worked and what didn t make improvements if their criticisms are well founded and continuously review your own storytelling style and material to become the best storyteller you can be beyond some simple feedback and nurturing consider getting real coaching from another storyteller a storyteller coach will tailor their advice to your specific needs and presentation and give concrete steps to help you build your business 8 x research source work on your timing pause for laughter when something is funny if you say something that is meant to be funny but falls flat move on 9 x research source use pauses between sentences to give your story a natural conversational rhythm do not speak too fast or you will lose the audience remember storytelling is not a race pause before revealing a surprise or a shocking conclusion if you plan on telling a story and you know you re limited to a certain amount of time ensure your story is the right length do not try to jam a 15 minute story into 8 minutes use repetition of a certain action or event to set up a pattern that will later be broken or drive home feelings of drudgery or disappointment for instance if your story is about a person s boring life don t just say that they walk home alone every single day say instead that they walked home alone every single day this emphasizes the monotonous lonely nature of their life speak rapidly but not so fast that the audience can t understand you to describe or depict a sudden jarring event or action work on your timing not only within each story but between stories as well if you intend to deliver multiple stories to a class or group of people follow a longer story with a shorter one and vice versa this will give your listeners a chance to mentally rest and reset their attention be confident in your delivery enunciate clearly and project your voice so that everyone in attendance can hear you your delivery should be energetic and memorable 10 x research source do not use filler words like uh anyways you know and so on keep your head up and eyes forward it helps to focus your eyes not on any particular member of the audience but on a point just over the heads of the audience and towards the back of the venue in which you re telling your story be authentic when telling your story even if the story you tell is fictional show enthusiasm for the characters and events don t be afraid to use unique voices for certain characters 11 x research source for instance if your story features a fierce monster make your voice harsh and scary when reciting the monster s dialogue if your character s are afraid speak in audible whispers as they would getting into character can bring the story to life keep your story focused 12 x research source a good story will revolve around a single well defined idea topic or theme 13 x research source when developing and practicing your story ask yourself what is this story about if you cannot answer concisely in a sentence or two revise the content of your story to keep it more tightly focused your audience should also be able to summarize the main theme or events of the story in a succinct way if other people who read or hear your story get confused in the telling you may need to edit the story for instance if you rehearse your story in front of a test audience of friends or family and they all have competing and contradictory ideas about what the story is about you might want to revise the way you tell your story examine each part of your story and ask yourself if it adds to the narrative flow the events of your story should be clear and connect with one another in a logical way listen to the advice of others when developing your story it is important to understand how other people receive and understand your story if it is to be effective and memorable soliciting feedback from other writers is especially useful use body language to engage your audience sharing a story well requires a total physical and mental commitment on the part of the storyteller 14 x research source the amount of physicality you include in your storytelling varies with the content and style of the story incorporating physical movement into your storytelling enhances the experience for instance if you re telling a story about a big bird you might say then the bird swooped down from its nest while saying this you might raise your hand high above your head and bend it at the wrist in a ninety degree angle you could then move the hand across and down your body at a forty five degree angle and elongate the long o sound in swooped this would add an exciting physical dimension to the story and help the audience visualize what it was like to see the bird swooping down from its perch don t over perform your story a storyteller is not an actor 15 x research source always keep your body language appropriate and relevant to the tone and style of the story don t quit your day job too soon 16 x research source working as a storyteller can be difficult work might be rare or periodical at times and unless you are highly sought after it might be hard to support yourself with your storytelling income work part time as a storyteller and keep your full time job until you re well established set some benchmarks to help you decide when you should make the move from part time to full time storytelling for example you might decide that if you make 1 500 each month from your storytelling you can become a full time storyteller a supportive spouse or partner who contributes to the household income can make it easier for you to take the necessary risk which becoming a full time storyteller entails keep enough money in the bank to carry you through lean times maintain at least six months worth of funds build a web presence start by building a social media presence on facebook twitter and the like as you get more experience and start to develop your business contract a web designer for your own web domain having your own website is important because it gives you total control over the style and presentation of your own work in a way that social media sites do not upload audio and or video of your stories in part or in whole provide a bio of yourself including how you got started as a storyteller and what drew you to it make your own life a story be sure to include contact info for people who want you to deliver some stories to their event or party get listed in online directories the storyteller net directory is a good place to start list your available services on local marketing sites like craigslist to get your name out too file the necessary paperwork open a business account register your business with your local and state authorities and maintain accurate tax and financial information like any other home business professional storytelling requires a keen eye for finances take some accounting classes or enlist the services of a skilled accountant to ensure your home based business conforms to the letter of the law your business will probably be registered as a sole proprietorship a business which is owned and operated by a single person be professional being professional means comporting yourself with grace and dignity and demanding respect from your audience and hosts for a professional storytelling session always plan ahead find out where the venue you ll be performing is where you can park and how many people will be in attendance if possible scout out the location before attending ask important questions like if you will be provided a microphone bottled water or other amenities if you are performing in a large hall in which sound does not easily carry suggest or insist that your hosts provide a microphone for your performance remember your reputation will suffer whether a bad storytelling performance is or isn t your fault similarly don t be afraid to ask that a teacher parent or other adult stay in the library or classroom with you if you re delivering a story to children always aim to defy your clients expectations and leave them wanting more join a professional organization the national storytelling network is the country s largest storytelling organization there are many other local and national storytelling

and attend the national storytelling conference 17 x research source find your audience many professional storytellers get more successful in their business when they identify a particular audience for their tales ask yourself what kind of stories you like to tell and who they would most appeal to for instance if you love metaphorical fables about anthropomorphic animals or tall tales about fantastic happenings you might be best suited to storytelling for a youth audience consider a career as a children s entertainer many professional storytellers reach out to the primary consumers of stories many professionals will admit that opportunities for children s entertainment far outnumber gigs for storytelling to adults being open to a young audience will help storytellers build a career librarians often pull double duty as both librarian and storyteller 18 x research source if you have a passion for telling stories you might be able to introduce a storytelling program to your library

us to suspend our disbelief becoming a filmmaker usually requires at least a four year degree in film you can make as many kinds of films as there are kinds of stories westerns sci fi movies romantic comedies thrillers documentaries and dramas consult with the film s writer to talk about their vision for the script and characters how do they see various lines of dialogue being delivered how do they imagine the characters moving and the sets looking since films almost always begin as a screenplay use that as your bible and integrate the writer s vision into your filmmaking process make shorter films first to get a feel for how the medium works most phones have a video function and can be a great first camera for a young amateur filmmaker get a production internship with a film studio to learn how the industry works continue developing your filmmaking abilities with new projects and developing new contacts with actors producers and studio executives consider becoming a musician or adding music to your story singer songwriters set stories to music and can use the rhythm and volume of their music to add gravitas to their storytelling process whether you rock out with a whole band behind you or simply strap on an acoustic guitar music can be an effective storytelling medium another community of professional storytellers includes those who tell their stories with a guitar drums or other musical instrument 21 x research source including music in the narrative can get both children and adults involved in clapping or singing along to your story musical storytelling can also constitute an important educational tool by providing new linguistic structures to young children think about adopting a spoken word storytelling style while spoken word storytelling requires no musical instruments it does require a sense of timing rhythm and often though not always rhyme look for opportunities to perform at open mic nights in your local coffee shops and bookstores become a religious officiant if you are a religious individual you might feel called to put your storytelling skills to use in the service to your higher power priests imams and rabbis don t just recite

how to make a professional rap music video,a professional rap video is one of the best ways for both musicians and filmmakers to get their art out into the world music videos in general are stylish short and manageable productions furthermore there is no limit to what a music video can be about as you have free rein to shoot a mini movie or just an awesome set of visuals for the rapper to spit in front of in general rap videos are driven by stylish visual flair the sort of thing you could have in the background of a club or party with or without sound,choose a theme or visual motif this simply a common set of colors locations or a mood that guides all of your shots professional rap videos tend to rely on creative visuals while the rapper spits his lines into the camera these themes can range from a lavish hip hop lifestyle 2 chainz s birthday song to a simple but striking visual theme craig mack s flava in ya ear for example uses stark black and white shots on a white background that makes each rapper a unique screen filling phenomenon the song s mood do the visuals fit alongside it or seem contradictory the budget more locations means more time and more money decide if you want to tell a story not all rap songs need to tell a story and most don t but some videos will even split the difference interspersing a short story throughout more traditional shots like in t i s whatever you like video t i starts with a short skit showing our feature dancer working at a fast food joint before using the video to show her rise to stardom and riches it is simple but effective especially with the ending skit that reveals it was all a daydream 1 x research source when writing a music video story keep it simple remember that all film stories come down to three questions who is the protagonist what do they want and how do they try to get it keep stories bound to one or two locations and actors the more complex the story the more difficult your shoot will be scout out cool locations for your rapper to perform in front of this is the main event of most professional rap videos and higher budget videos might have 4 5 locations each watch a few of your favorite videos and note where they place the rappers some of the most common locations include hometown streets or neighborhood joints if in public call the chamber of commerce for film permits party locations like houses pools or the beach rooftops graffiti tagged walls or deep city environments be sure to check with the original artist when possible green screens allowing you free rein of backgrounds round up extras through friends family and advertisements a great rap video looks a lot like a party and will be played in the background of parties and clubs so don t leave your rapper all on their own round up as many people as you can to have fun in the background especially your more attractive friends put out an ad on craigslist or visit the local colleges to try and round up warm bodies it is good practice to buy the extras and crew lunch as that alone entices many people to get involved pick up a few dancers to flank your rapper or a feature dancer to star in the video there is no rule that a video must have dancers but there aren t many that don t why because sex sells if you don t want to work with background dancers consider getting a feature dancer the one woman or man who your rapper and camera focus most of their attention on they can be a love interest or just a good looking dancer but either way they give you a little more shot variety right off the bat feature dancers are the second star of the video which usually means they need to be in the story shots too if you have them 2 x research source consider who will handle the choreography for dancers remember that if you have dancers someone will have to choreograph them there are several options if you don t know how to dance or have too much on your plate to choreograph yourself ask the dancers you hire if they are willing to choreograph as well especially for a higher fee keep the dancing loose let the dancers improvise as if they were at a party hire or consult a dedicated choreographer college dance departments are a great low cost place to start asking around ensure that you have the necessary equipment for a professional shoot luckily for you all you really need for a music video is at least one camera and some lights since all of the video s sound will come from the song that said the type of amount of equipment you have will make a big difference on the videos you can shoot cameras tripods you want something that can shoot at 720p minimum and preferably 1080p or higher 2 3 cameras are often best allowing you to catch multiple angles at once but only if they all can shoot at the same settings 3 x research source lights never underestimate the power of good lighting you can always darken a video later but it is very very hard to make it lighter without ruining picture quality in a pinch get a bunch of bulbs and clamp lights from a local hardware store essential miscellaneous equipment speakers to play song extension cables power strips black tape tool set back up batteries and memory cards necessary permits 4 x research source use your desired shots and equipment craft to make a budget no filmmaker likes budgeting but it is the difference between many amateurs and the professionals keep your budget simple and realistic do you need 10 fake guns or can you live with 2 can you shoot closer to the stage and use 5 extras instead of 15 solve these issues now not the day before shooting things to remember include equipment you must rent location and permit fees props and costumes crew fees it is possible to get crews for free check local colleges but it rare to get help for more than a weekend without pay food and transportation costs per day of shooting for a truly professional shoot with an all paid cast and crew you should budget at minimum 2 500 a day double this if you want to capture sound like dialogue in a story scene diagram any story shots in advance grab a pen and paper or print out some storyboards from the internet a storyboard is simply a comic book version of your video which allows you play with the shots and ideas without wasting time or money on set remember that a story at minimum needs three parts which you can diagram or illustrate any way you want for an example check out the humorous story in das racist s girl which almost anyone could shoot on a minimal budget the problem first we meet the characters a gorgeous girl and a working class boy who is immediately in love with her she doesn t notice him the struggle second we realize the boy doesn t have the courage to talk to her so he follows her instead using purely visual jokes the video explores his increasingly funny attempts to get close to her the resolution he gets beaten up for his love by some thugs but he doesn t give up in a hilarious reversal of expectation he makes his move finally on facebook note how this is only about 50 of the video your story doesn t have to be long as rapping and dancing can fill up the rest of the time 5 x research source stage each scene with actors rappers extras then set up lights accordingly use the cameras to find your angles for each location then set the actors up in a dry run once you know where they ll be and where they need to move you can set lights to ensure everything is visible and well lit in general your goal when lighting is to have a few deep dark blacks small sections with clear whites and a large range of grays and other colors in between the 1 2 hours before sunset and after sunrise have the best lighting of the day overcast days however are the most useful since the light is calm but widespread under the clouds while three lights with even shadows are the norm don t discount more adventurous lighting patterns like coolio s gangster s paradise which uses interrogation type lighting for a extra dramatic feel it can help to prep shots in black and white mode to see how the lighting looks without color a good shot in black and white will look great in color usually keep your direction simple and loose especially with extras this isn t a feature film requiring precise coordinated movements let people have fun and keep your direction simple in general you ll have the best results by letting people bring their own personality on camera instead of micromanaging if you re in with friends or trusted collaborators consider having someone in charge of the extras providing light instruction while you set up shots or lights shoot 2 3 takes with the song playing and rapper rapping first if something happens to your production you want to be sure you have enough footage for a full video as soon as possible pick your favorite 1 2 locations and run through the whole song several times ensuring you could put a video together even you can t film again for some reason take multiple angles here instead of shooting the same shot three times if you know the first one is good move the camera before doing it again make sure the rapper is the focus of most shots rap is a personality driven art form where the individual rapper is the main force behind albums videos and sales make sure that they are the focus of all the rapping sections and they don t leave the video for too long during any one section good ways to keep them involved but still have an interesting changing video include costume or outfit changes rapping while in action driving counting money flirting etc using extreme or interesting angles like very low high shots fisheye lenses etc 6 x research source grab any story shots without sound to speed up the process because you don t need to sync dancing or rapping with the story shots and there are no lines of dialogue or microphones to set up you can usually run and gun story shots quickly once the main shots are finished when shooting story shots keep a checklist of the shots you need and cross them off as you work nothing is worse than getting into editing and realizing a key chapter is missing take 2 3 takes of each shot ensuring at least one of each will work keep the shots short think of linking a lot of little images instead of filming one continuous story pick up b roll or extra shots that look cool in the end b roll shots are images that you don t have a place for yet but will eventually fill in any gaps you have while editing think of a feature film where many scenes start and end with artistic shots that aren t strictly necessary but tie the whole thing together some ideas of b roll include solo or up close shots of important props shots of the dancers or extras having fun cool shots of each location helping the viewer see where you are 7 x research source use the music in the track to line the videos up with each other since everything moves to the same words and rhythm you can cut from one video to another smoothly once you have your videos synced in your editing software stack all of the videos on top of each other then slide them left and right until they are totally synced up since you ll be able to hear the song in each video take you ll be able to easily match them up by hearing when the song is just a little off it can help to put a clean mp3 version of the song in the video editor as well using this as your baseline when syncing videos high end video software like adobe premier often has a sync feature there are also professional sync programs like pluraleyes but they are generally used for shoots with many cameras and microphones if you took tons and tons of video you may decide to do this in smaller pieces only syncing up the segments you are currently editing and then matching it all together later both strategies work 8 x research source handle any story segments first before moving to the general footage try to make this footage as interesting as possible without any music at all remember you re trying to tell the story visually consider it like a flipbook or a story told in slideshow if one shot is the girl getting ready for the club the next should be here going to the club or arriving don t show her getting ready over and over again a good example of how not to do this might be twista s overnight celebrity which resorts to the same or similar shots over and over again you can fine tune the cuts to match the music later for now just focus on telling a good story the music when added should make a good edit better it shouldn t be the only reason it works keep edits quick to make the video move the best practice for editing a music video is watching a ton of them note how short each cut is music videos rarely hold on the same image for more than 2 3 seconds and rap is no exception quick cuts keep the audience engaged and keep the song moving along quickly whereas long cuts tend to make the song feel slower or like the video is dragging there are always exceptions but this is a good ground rule to start with avoid falling directly on the beat with each cut falling on the beat means that each cut comes in a regular rhythmic 1 2 3 4 it is tempting for young video makers to cut everything right to the beat but for an audience member this quickly becomes tiring and predictable instead pick the 5 10 moments where coming in on the beat really highlights a big moment such as when the song drops or comes back in or for select montages during climactic moments it can help to cut the whole video to the beat then trim away and edit it later once you can tell the places where it works and the places it doesn t alternatively some editors will cut most of the video with no music then go back and see how it lines up later adding on the beat sections as desired add a clean perfect version of the track when done watch the video with this clean version and make any last adjustments don t rely on the song recordings you got while shooting you want the best most professional quality version of the song you can get for the final video use your video editing software to do basic color correction a hallmark of truly professional videos color correction separates the amateurs from the pros which is why most young filmmakers forget or ignore it color correction however is easier than you think to begin as a color corrector pick your absolute favorite visual clip and use the brightness contrast and hue saturation effects to adjust it until it is perfect then use the same effects to make every other video look as much like this master clip as possible the primary goal of color correction is to ensure that the clips all flow smoothly together as if they were all shot at the same exact time as you get better you can use color correction to influence the mood of the video as well using blues and greens for calm or darker tones and reds and oranges for happier shots try something unique and break the above rules check out cyhi the prince s cold as ice video it is simple just 2 locations a costume change and a feature dancer but the editing style which overlays multiple shots at once makes it immediately recognizable and unique if you feel confident as an editor rap videos are a great way to show your chops and make something wholly new and original maybe you want to do one long take without any cuts this doesn t even have to be difficult as bob dylan s seminal subterranean homesick blues video attests what video effects can you play with and push to their extremes try crazy color schemes black and white etc these changes are very simple to change back in editing 9 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to direct a choir,as a choir director your job is to shape the sound of the choir teach the music and evaluate and correct any problems within the vocal performance here are some steps to help you successfully form and direct a choir,watch other directors modeling your hand signals body language and facial expressions off of other directors is the best way to understand the kinds of signals to which experienced singers are already accustomed to 1 x research source watch videos of other choir directors online watch live performances of professional choirs and focus on what the director does and how the singers respond to each signal go to live choir performances and watch the director be sure you choose a seat that enables a clear view of the director take notes about what seems to work especially well sit in on a choir rehearsal and watch the director from the singers points of view make yourself a cheat sheet of signals writing down the signals that you plan to use will lead to more consistency when used go big most signals must be exaggerated for your singers to see them clearly particularly with a large choir or with children however try not to exaggerate so much that the audience would be distracted by your movements watch yourself directing direct in front of a mirror or videotape yourself directing and determine whether your signals are clear practice frequently the more you practice using your directing body language the more comfortable you will be doing it in front of an actual choir play your favorite choral music and pretend that you are directing it if you know another choir director ask if you can borrow their already trained choir for a part of a rehearsal then ask for feedback or tips from the singers or the choir director decide whether or not to hold auditions while holding auditions may lead to a more skilled choir some choir directors choose to give all those interested an opportunity to participate plan the auditions if you decide to have auditions be sure to do the following steps if you do not plan to hold auditions you can skip ahead to the next part secure a time and place for your auditions for consistency it may be best to hold auditions in the room you in which you will be rehearsing or performing advertise your auditions think about the types of singers you wish to recruit and plan your advertising accordingly you may want to start advertising several weeks to a month before the auditions will take place decide whether to have singers prepare their own piece of music for the audition or sight read on the spot this information should be included in the advertisement hold the auditions listening to each vocalist sing and taking thorough notes about their performance will help you in your selection process evaluate the vocal ability of each singer by noting the range and quality of each voice you may want to develop a short questionnaire for singers to disclose experience describe vocal range ability to read music etc maintain a neutral facial expression during each singer s tryout and be sure to remain professional and polite someone s feelings may be hurt by a frown or other reaction to a poor performance or you may get up someone s hope by seeming excessively pleased select your choir members determine the number of singers you need as well as the voice mix you desire then select those singers required if you have very experienced strong singers you can form a small group whereas less skilled singers do better in a large group ensure that you have the appropriate balance in vocal parts soprano alto tenor and bass you may make other balance considerations as well be sure to consider other aspects such as gender age and race to maintain diversity notify those chosen of your decision you will need to notify those who auditioned whether or not they were chosen for the choir by writing a letter or posting a list or phoning be sure to write a short note of thanks to those who were not selected select music that is appropriate for the occasion there are many considerations that influence music selection is the choir religious or secular what season is it if the choir is performing as a part of a larger event what is the tone of the event 2 x research source select music that is appropriate for your choir music selections should be based on the skill level of your choir and should be easy enough that they can be successful but complex enough that they will be challenged be sure you have appropriate permissions to advertise and perform your selected music you may want to find music that is in the public domain if you do not have a budget for royalties 3 x research source interpret and study music selections it is important that you know how you want the music to sound before you begin working with pieces with the choir 4 x research source meet with the accompanist to discuss the music and your interpretation of it become very familiar with the music including all of the individual vocal parts and how you will conduct it before going into rehearsal do not try to learn it as you go prepare a detailed rehearsal plan the plan should include an attendance policy with repercussions for missing practices include date time and place for each rehearsal your accompanist should be at all of your rehearsals if your chorus is a cappella or if you are using pre recorded accompanying music you do not need an accompanist begin holding rehearsals when introducing new music be sure to discuss in detail the musical piece you have chosen break each piece up into manageable sections you do not need to work an entire piece in one rehearsal be consistent with the format of your rehearsals start with a warm up then move to the sections that are to be rehearsed be clear about your goals for each rehearsal hold sectional or solo rehearsals privately as needed working with individuals or small groups can be as important as rehearsing with the entire choir work with soloists to perfect each s part to make their performance more polished during sectional rehearsals split the choir into individual voice parts and rehearse each part separately this way more time may be devoted to ensuring that notes and rhythms are mastered reassemble the sections and soloists back together as an ensemble after you are satisfied with their work in sectionals decide what type of clothing or uniform your choir will wear on performance night all of the members of your choir should have coordinated outfits that do not distract from their performance and that look professional church choirs may already have choir robes be sure to communicate with the church organizers about choir expectations other types of choir groups such as school or community choirs may not have preexisting uniforms but may wear white shirts with black pants or skirts teach your choir that details are important while secondary to singing skills such as taking a bow together at the end if applicable or sitting and standing in unison can make the difference between an amateur and professional looking performance advertise your performance be sure to include detail such as time date and place of performance featured singers and hosting organization include ticket prices or suggested donation if applicable hold a brief warm up session prior to the performance warming up will ensure that your choir is ready to sing and you can be sure that everyone is present try not to introduce any new information before a performance instead try to fine tune things that you have already worked on give a few last minute reminders if necessary but try not to overwhelm your choir with different things to remember begin the performance be sure to communicate with the director of the event about how and when to begin the performance as well as where the choir should sit or stand both before and during the choral performance while directing be consistent use the cues hand gestures and facial expressions that you used during rehearsals after a performance praise your singers privately save any constructive criticism for the next rehearsal tonight let them shine,Arts-and-Entertainment

is often found near although not exactly at the page s middle waldo is not hiding all of the time in any single one corner of a page he found that waldo is rarely in the right hand corner at the top of the right page in general waldo is not found as often near the bottom or top of a page however more than half of the time waldo is hiding within one of two 1 5 inch tall bands the first one is located three inches from the page s bottom the other one is seven inches from the bottom waldo is also not likely to be found in the middle of the page but just above or below it in one of these two

how to make a recording studio,have a musical itch do you want to set up your own home recording studio with all the gear required it can be tough to know where to start while studio making can be overwhelming the basics are actually pretty straightforward you can learn how to plan a studio what essential gear you ll need and how to set it up in order to start cutting tracks as soon as possible,find a good location the best recording studios are in windowless well insulated rooms depending on the size of the group you want to record the room should at least be able to hold a small table for your computer and interface there should also be room for the performers avoid rooms with lots of outside noise aim for the quietest space possible you don t want a great take interrupted by your neighbor s lawnmower 1 x research source in general bigger is better try to find a room that won t be too cramped and that has space for several musicians and all your gear pay attention to the room s floor ideal rooms will have hardwood concrete or tile flooring which is better for acoustics carpeting will absorb high frequency sounds but not low ones 2 x research source it may also get worn down by high foot traffic pick a room with good overall acoustics this usually means a larger room with fairly high ceilings asymmetrical walls and irregular surfaces for sound dispersion 3 x research source consider a suite of rooms if possible full scale recording studios usually have at least two rooms for production one of these is called the live room and another is the control room there may also be one or more small rooms called booths or isolation booths in professional studios the live room is where musicians perform it is usually separate from the booth where single musicians or vocalists can be acoustically isolated for very clean takes the engineer does the recording editing and mixing of the takes in the control room in many homes a suite set ups won t be possible you may only have space for a live room at most you may be limited to a small live room and control room closets can be often be converted into small isolation booths as well map out the basic set up there s more to a recording studio than just microphones and musicians in most studios there are two major systems you ll need to understand and organize these according to your interests and the projects you intend to record the first setup is the recording system this takes in audio from instruments and microphones and records it either digitally using a computer or digital recorder or to tape the second system is called the monitor system this includes an amplifier and speakers for the recording engineer to listen to the recording as it is being performed as well as after the recording to do mixing and editing 4 x research source you can set up a home recording studio with a pretty small budget at the very least you ll need a computer a daw audio interface combo studio monitors one set of headphones one mic a few cables and one mic stand 5 x research source it is possible to put together a basic setup for around 400 you probably don t want to go much lower though or the music quality will suffer design a signal pathway in the professional world audio systems of any kind can be illustrated by drawing a signal path this follows the audio signal from beginning to end to show the user exactly what is being done to the sound in a particular system for a typical beginner s studio the signal path follows a basic plan 6 x research source the signal starts at the input source i e the instruments and microphones from there it goes to a recording interface a device that plugs into a computer and converts the analog sound waves into digital data from the computer interface the signal will go into digital audio workstation daw software it is here that the recorded sound can be edited or mixed the signal next goes into an audio or recording interface to be returned into an analog signal the analog signal lastly comes out through the monitor system get a computer with plenty of ram the more powerful your computer the easier the producing of music will be by power that means lots of storage space and lots of ram upgrading ram and storage is the most important thing because this will give the computer faster and smoother running speeds 7 x research source for most audio software you ll want a computer with at least a dual core processor if you intend to mix lots of tracks however consider a quad or multi dual core it s important to have a separate computer for recording don t use your personal computer with all of your pictures games and music on it pro tools and other recording software will require a lot of operating space apple macbook pro is a popular model for many do it yourself musicians this is because the model has lots of storage space lasts for years and is very portable 8 x research source apple also offers upgrades for ram memory graphics chip and other options the computer costs between 1200 and 2500 choose recording software all modern recording studios use computer software to save audio and allow for careful editing digital audio workstations daws vary greatly from one maker to the next but one is usually included with the purchase of a recording interface 9 x research source mac users benefit from the inclusion of garage band on modern macs while pc users can use one of many free alternatives like the free version of pro tools 12 pro tools m powered is another common daw it is a basic home recording program with limited features pro tools le offers limited features again but is a step up from m powered 10 x research source pro tools hd is professional grade recording software and has become something of the standard for commercial studios 11 x research source other daws include apple logic a mac only program audacity an open source program compatible with windows os x and linux systems and ableton live 12 x research source 13 x research source select an appropriate interface for your studio audio interfaces are also called ad da converters which stands for analog to digital digital to analog these interfaces convert analog sound into a digital signal to be processed by your computer and also turn the digital audio back into analog sound on the monitors they are an essential part of any good recording studio some entry level interfaces include emu s 1212m esi s julia and m audio s audiofile 192 these models offer quality sound for a modest price 14 x research source a good quality recording interface typically costs around 150 monitors such as the immensely popular krk rokit series start at roughly 300 for a pair higher grade interfaces like the focusrite and audiofire series fireface 400 and 800 and lynx models will cost more up to a couple of thousand dollars get some high quality microphones typically most recording studios have some combo of dynamic and condenser microphones for performers to use dynamic mics are better for louder sounds and are more durable they are used for guitar amps drums and other loud sources condensers are more delicate and expensive but also more detailed bright and clear than similarly priced dynamics 15 x research source a good dynamic or condenser microphone costs 80 200 be sure that your recording interface has phantom power when using a condenser mic this is usually a button or switch labeled 48 and powers the electronics inside the microphone if this feature is not available most microphone preamplifiers can supply power and will be more affordable than buying a new interface 16 x research source dynamic mics do not require power so they can simply be plugged into an interface and used with no preamplifier in some cases they sound better with a preamp however some mics also have usb outputs while these can be plugged straight into a computer they tend to be of lower quality electric instruments will also plug straight into a di unit or direct box which connects to the computer via usb 17 x research source be frugal when buying gear like music itself music production is an art and not a science the price tag on your gear does always not lead to better quality low end equipment in today s amateur home studios would have been unthinkable to top studio engineers just a few decades ago it s possible to record radio bangers on a home studio setup expensive gear is great and can lead to great recordings but don t let that hold you back from making great music take advantage of free software native instruments ohmforce camel audio ssl and other respected audio companies offer free virtual instruments and effects consider using old analog gear most studios are digital these days but the really good ones still have analog gear you can work into your rig if you want to put your studio on the map consider adding a plate reverb unit or a reel to reel tape machine you can record on one of these and bounce the audio into your daw when you re done these kinds of sound can t be replicated digitally 18 x research source have some musical instruments on hand most studios assume musicians want to play their own gear to get a more accurate recording this makes the engineer s job more difficult because she s got to spend a lot of time setting up unfamiliar instruments some studios however will have gear in place that the engineer knows and can use to achieve a particular sound try having a variety of gear around amps effects pedals and guitars are good if you have more money also consider keyboards and synthesizers drums or even a piano soundproof the live room soundproofing really does two things it makes the room quieter by blocking out outside noise it also makes the sound quality better on recording by absorbing excess acoustic ambience 19 x research source professional soundproofing can be expensive acoustic foam or panels work if you have money to spend but may run you significant costs for a large studio one inexpensive way to reduce sound is in the selection of the studio space try to select a live room without windows and with heavy thick walls or thick insulation 20 x research source if you are on a budget get some blankets and cover up any windows and doors to reduce background noise added mass to the walls like foam also helps to increase the room s sound absorption this should reduce echoes 21 x research source prepare a vocal booth most studios set aside space specifically for vocals vocals can be hard to record they should be recorded standing up which makes it easier for the singer to sustain a good sound the mic should also be at a comfortable height the vocal booth is an isolation booth so it should be acoustically isolated make sure to soundproof it as best you can the mic itself should have a pop filter to protect it from saliva and to filter out sharp sounds like t s and s s if you don t have a pop filter you can buy one for 10 or 20 if your mic is directional so that only one side picks up sound turn it so the side of the mic is facing the vocalist his mouth should be about 10 15 cm away from the mic when singing this distance shouldn t be altered too much as it will cause the recording to sound off 22 x research source set up the instrumentalists in the live room you ll want mics to be just far enough from the sound source i e acoustic instruments or amplifiers so that they don t hinder the musicians this typically doesn t involve a pop filter of any kind if you have a small instrumental mic use that instructions are usually included with the user manual use component mics or a single mic above the drums recording drums will vary according to the type of sound you want and what kind of gear the musicians come with the best drum sound comes from single mics that clip onto individual components you can then put these on the same channel in the daw if you don t feel like outfitting each component with a separate mic take one mic and position it a few feet above the center of the kit no pop filter is needed but make sure to face the mic s recording side down doing so will add more room sound to the mix,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to become a better artist,being an artist includes continuously evolving your skills improving your technique and pushing yourself beyond the next boundary it s part of your growth as an artist and can even see you changing your artistic techniques completely several times during a lifetime becoming a better artist is a journey and will bring greater satisfaction to you as you continue to build on what you already know,buy all of the necessary supplies drawing pencils erasers sketchbook pastels paint an easel whatever you think you will need for your area of expertise new supplies and mediums can be encouraging try beginner sets of artist grade supplies because they are often easier to use than the cheaper student grade supplies 1 x research source begin with an inexpensive sketchbook with lots of pages and a sketching set that includes kneaded putty eraser and different grades of graphite pencils it may also include charcoal pencils charcoal sticks graphite sticks and brown gray or reddish sketching sticks all these tools are useful and the supplies are cheaper in bundled sets than bought individually h and 2h 4h etc are hard pencils that sharpen to a fine point and give a very light mark easily covered by paint or inking they re for design f is a fine pencil a little harder than an hb which is a normal no 2 pencil and middle hardness b means black and each successive degree of b pencil is softer blacker and smudgier 2b is a good sketch pencil 4b is a great one that gives good shading and 6b or higher is almost like using charcoal for ease of smudging and shading 2 x research source purchase some how to drawing books this includes books on specific subjects like how to draw animals how to draw horses how to draw seascapes etc whatever you like most or get interested in try to accomplish at least one drawing a day you can even frame them and put them up on your walls to inspire you to keep going through the next day you can also check out drawing books from your local library and find out which one inspires you the most before buying it work through each of the exercises in turn rather than trying to do everything in the book at once date your daily sketches they don t need to be complex or difficult a five minute gesture sketch is as useful for learning to draw as a half hour spent doing a detailed drawing if you have a half hour spending it on half a dozen shorter sketches will actually give better practice try to get it right but don t worry about perfection you ll achieve good recognizable drawings by constant practice more than anything else 3 x research source choose a favorite subject this might be your favorite animal a favorite flower a rock a bottle with light coming through it anything you would really like to draw well and care about personally draw the same thing over and over many times in many different ways repeated drawing of the same subject or type of subject each of your cats your cat from several different photos your cat s paw one day your cat s nose the next will give you a much richer grasp of the anatomy and proportions of that subject when you ve drawn your pet cat enough times it becomes easy to sketch a tiger on the first try draw enough pebbles and a mountain becomes easy and understandable sketch and draw anything you see it could be the homeless dude begging for change or the little girl skipping around with a balloon in her hand whatever you see that looks interesting draw or sketch it 4 x research source still life is one of the easiest subjects for beginners to draw literally the objects don t move choose simple ones at first a vase without too many curlicues a few pebbles a flower without too many petals a clear bottle with an interesting shape etc draw each of the objects separately as a study then start arranging them together in different ways to see how they go together the big advantage to still life is that your models don t move and if you do it indoors the light from your lamps doesn t change with the time of day either animal drawing may be your passion start with your pets start when they re sleeping even if that doesn t seem like an exciting pose it s when the animal s more likely to hold still long enough to be drawn use photos of your pets visit zoos with a camera and snap photos of every animal you see and like then work from your own photos look for open source photos like wikipedia commons and other photos where the photographer gives permission to draw from them you can also contact photographers who take good animal photos and post them on flickr or facebook asking permission to draw from their photos many will be happy to give permission and most will want to see your drawings when you re used to drawing animals fast from life try drawing at the zoo or wildlife like the birds at your feeder life drawing of animals is a good way to learn to do quick gestures and detail them later buildings and architecture study perspective as it s important in buildings more than anything else to make them look real find a good book on perspective and do all the exercises be careful about working from photos because they will sometimes distort vertical lines and alter perspective you may have to correct the photo once you understand what you re doing this is another popular fine art subject that never loses its appeal like still life you can go out and draw buildings in person without your model getting up to walk away 5 x research source landscapes are a traditional fine art subject sketch your own yard from life often sometimes a small beautiful area sometimes trying for the big panoramic view go out on camping trips or visit local parks with your sketchbook in hand do several quick five minute or less gesture sketches to get the main elements of your landscape design down just rough outlines then pick the best small thumbnail and draw that view larger this saves a host of troubles over starting with the details of a leaf and only finishing one branch of that tree in an hour details are actually easier than doing the big shapes of things landscape drawing is about textures shapes and light that changes quickly so learn to draw fast get the shapes of shadows down first thing because the angle of the light will change in half an hour and so will the shape of the shadows people are a popular subject for drawing start with the friends and family members you can convince to sit still for a half hour or more to let you draw them paint the ones you love sketch anyone who interests you again practice quick small gesture drawings in public so that you can get the gist of a figure or a face within a few minutes before the person wanders off or does something else sketching in public is also a great ice breaker a good way to meet people because someone often wanders up to see what you re drawing you have a topic to talk about right away art one that most people like and one that isn t controversial look into art lessons of some sort most places offer community classes where you can sign up to take some art lessons just know that you will have to invest a bit of money but it certainly will help look for art lessons online and art videos or dvds many professional artists create instructional dvds in various mediums or on drawing in general websites with forums like http www wetcanvas com will often have free art lessons with volunteer teachers who give assignments critique your work and help in encouraging ways sites like http how to draw and paint com may have a lot of free instruction available and downloadable e books as well as further instruction for sale try before you buy with online art lessons some are as good or better than in person art instruction you should like the teacher s art and also enjoy the teacher s style of presentation to get the most out of an online class 6 x research source subscribe to art instruction magazines the artist s magazine pastel journal watercolor artist american artist and others all have excellent articles on how to draw and paint the more you read the more you ll understand the many technical terms and different techniques there are to drawing and painting learning art is cumulative it may seem easy because people who do something well for a long time do it easily but it s a complex field of study that takes time and effort to master patience practice and study are what really constitutes talent talent is loving the process so much that you re willing to put up with your mistakes in order to learn how to do it so well others call you talented this usually comes at the point they can recognize what you drew for what it is learn composition and design look for books on design and composition take classes in design study it as much as you do how to draw things accurately it makes the difference between whether you create great art or just copies of photos learn how to crop reference photos choose which subjects to shoot or sketch in a landscape guide a viewer s attention in the painting to the most important thing in it a portrait s eyes the sunlit patch in a landscape that you chose as a focal point the animal bending to drink the people on the beach some subjects are attention getters by themselves like a cute kitten but you can improve on that cute kitten picture to the point it s irresistible if you learn good design principles and give just the right balance of background space around it 7 x research source get a job if you are old enough it could be at a craft store like joanne s or michael s or you could be an intern at some sort of design studio get to know a gallery owner and volunteer to help with setting up shows and you may eventually be hired to work at the gallery alternately sell your art online at ebay or etsy sell portraits or pet portraits or landscapes in person off the easel bring your portfolio to galleries sell at art fairs or science fiction or media conventions 8 x research source what type of art you do will affect where it sells best and whether you re ready to make a living at art yet the point at which good art supplies pay for themselves comes very fast whenever you master at least one popular subject that non artists like your work this can be cartoon cats dragons cute manga animals or cute manga kids as easily as a fine art subject someone will offer to buy something sell it give them that joy even if you know you could have done it better the connection they have with your drawing is real and emotional your technical criticism has more to do with your growth as an artist and less to do with the external value of your art you re often its poorest judge don t undersell yourself to make a living in art learn how to become self employed there are many aspects to self employment that have nothing to do with how well you draw and paint everything to do with how well you manage your money and time if you prefer to set your own schedule make all your own business and financial decisions work well without supervision plan schedule and complete major projects without any outside authority the life of a full time self employed artist may be right for you if it s not then enjoy having a side income and look for a related job where you have an employer a steady check benefits and someone else responsible for all the business stuff how much you need to earn to be happy in life is a lifestyle choice if you have your health you may not need a high income to be happy as a full time artist if you have dependents or health issues it may not be practical to go full time until you can earn a professional level income pursue your career part time till it matches your job income 9 x research

how to have presence,in acting modeling and even business presence also commonly referred to as it is an important part of getting people interested in you in some spiritual circles presence and spirit are one and the same meditation contemplation acting dance and sports all seek to connect with something deeper since some schools of thought believe that presence can be found through reflection and meditation this wikihow covers getting into the mindset and looking and acting the part in addition to mental reflection and relaxation that it might not be so elusive after all remember everything in life can be learned in the case of a quality such as presence the learning is learning to control your mindset in with the good out with the bad,be confident it is virtually impossible to have presence and have that it factor when you re riddled with insecurity instead of engaging in the moment and grabbing it by its horns you ll be busy huddling in the corner waiting for the jury to get their harsh judgment over with no article can give you a mathematical formula for confidence but it can tell you how awesome you are and that you definitely have things to be confident about it s important at least in the topic of having presence to think of confidence as quiet no hard hitting bravado or hubris is appropriate here there s no room for displays of power or boastfulness presence is natural and just is your confidence needn t be a show it should just be something that s a part of you think of confidence as in the same category as your height or hair color people notice you don t say anything about it but people notice that s how it should be get comfortable let s say beyoncé joins you in line for the women s restroom or jay z if you re a male but then there s probably not a line you would love to have a conversation with her and to snap a quick photo but you really have to pee how present and engaged will you be with her not very so whatever situation you re in beyoncé or not get comfortable it ll be the only way you can give it your all that means adjust the temperature go to the bathroom and for your sake wear comfortable pants if you feel something in your teeth or are constantly fighting an uphill battle against a wedgie you won t be exuding presence do whatever you can to un preoccupy your mind be yourself there is a certain genuineness about presence after all if you re fake it s not you who s in the room it s some image you re trying to show the world most people can detect this whether they re aware of it or not so act natural be yourself what good is it doing you pretending to be something else people who aren t comfortable with themselves are always caught up in some image maintaining they feel like they have to be seen wearing the right things saying the right things doing the right things and all in the right places with the right people they have no view of themselves because the only thing that matters to them is the opinions of others these people don t have presence presence isn t something anyone else can give you don t worry about how you come off really we ve spent the past four paragraphs saying just this if the people you re with don t like you how long are you really gonna be around them anyway you re not so if you are just you which is the only person you ll be around for the rest of oh you know forever and you re not caught up worrying about your image the better parts of you can shine think of this impression management as a layer of dust over whatever it is that makes up you instead of seeing who you are people see this dust the dust isn t bad the dust isn t good it s just dust it s easily wiped away and while it doesn t turn other people off it hides what makes you memorable it hides what makes you awesome check your temper if presence were easily define able part of the definition would be an innate sense of calmness someone with presence charisma and that ineffable it factor is never seen storming about making waves or punishing others arbitrarily generally anger is a resort and someone with presence just doesn t need to waste time on it they re too calm and collected to need to put up a fuss put your phone away seriously have you ever gone out to a restaurant and noticed that one couple that s sitting by the window where the guy is on his phone playing candy crush and the girl is taking selfies or pictures of the food that was once on her half eaten plate if you want people to notice you hiding behind a light up screen isn t the way to go about doing it so get in the moment put your phone away not just down and give the people around you your undivided attention so here s a little science being dropped so much of how people think and feel about you is really how you make them feel about themselves if you pay attention to them they re going to feel important and they re going to like you and think you re a great listener flirt with someone and they like you because you make them feel attractive so when you put your phone down you re showing them you re there with them and only them that you care and that they matter boom you re present and what s a word that sounds ridiculously like present hmm take a deep breath okay let s say you re walking into a big important meeting you want to be the one who people can look to the natural leader for the next assigned project the one people come to with questions and not the other way around but you re a little nervous and you know you re a little nervous instead of walking in and throwing up the white flag take a deep breath maybe smooth your hair a bit adjust your seams slow your movements and then walk in you got this why would anyone think otherwise no you re right presence is not a show it s not something you lose when you re harried and rushed but if you re nervous if you re running around like a chicken with your head cut off people can see that you might still be super confident and have your act together but you ll appear too frazzled for that intangible aura of leadership to come through show body language that s engaged let s take steve jobs a really powerful guy eloquent charming rich as hell now imagine him at a meeting where he s slumped over ignoring everyone and just playing on his iphone face adorned with a slight scowl not exactly a guy you d peg for having presence huh so even if you are the one in the room with the most presence you gotta show it so spread out the room is yours feel free to spread out her legs people who are more confident are more comfortable taking up a bit more room put your arms on the table lean forward a bit into the person who s talking to show you re engaged nod when it s clear they re trying to get a not so crystal point across look them in the eye be there in mind spirit and body walk tall if you ve never thought about your walk before it s time to start in fact it s time to experiment your mind takes cues from your body so you may even feel the confidence ooze through you when you walk more confidently go on try it walk back and forth across the room with your head held a bit above 90 degrees and your shoulders back walk at a moderate pace how s it feel now walk back and forth across the room with your head down and your shoulders hunched over a bit walk slowly at the end of your walk hold that position how do things feel different make eye contact a huge part in engaging with people in showing them that you re listening because women hate being ignored and to show that you don t care is eye contact plenty of nice guys don t get the girl because they can t look at her plenty of salesmen don t make the sale because their sideways glances give them away and plenty of people don t seem confident and put together because they re too afraid to make that connection people see you regardless of whether or not you re looking at them so why not look back for the record there s a huge difference between eye contact and staring a good rule of thumb is to look at the person and do blink while they re making a point if you re responding switch it up a little or if the conversation is breezy or they re gesturing give your eyeballs some literal wiggle room dress the part okay so when it comes to presence clothes don t make the man that being said having the right wardrobe is the first filter people put you through when they re taking you in so while clothes won t give you presence they ll get you through the door where the presence is sitting in a bowl by the window it s not about wearing brand names it s not about suits and dresses it s mostly about being put together and well groomed if you ve showered shaved put on some deodorant and dressed in decent clothes with the light on you should be okay be present if you ve read the first two sections you probably already have an idea of how to do this it means putting your phone down engaging with your body language having showered in the recent past and just grounding yourself in the moment it s called presence for a reason you can t have presence if you don t show up connect to the moment think of it as your moment if you re on stage the stage is yours this moment is yours and this character is you there s nothing to worry about you re there in mind body and spirit there s no panel of judges there s no fight with your boyfriend there s no football game on tv there s just now where you are never let em see you sweat don t give them the satisfaction a person with presence is always cool calm and collected when everyone else is pulling their hair out with stress you re the one getting things done with a smile on your face you do this stuff in your sleep you eat this stuff for breakfast no biggie nothing can shake you this goes double if your presence is onstage or in front of a camera any nervousness any agitation will be seen or captured you ve probably seen an actor who couldn t seem to commit to an action or behavior because they were too busy overthinking it worrying what was correct when you start sweating you ve already lost confidence in you and others will shortly follow suit don t soften your words this is a problem for most of us especially women we re taught to say i think maybe this will help the problem instead of here s the solution we qualify our words and say i m sorry as a casual starter to any sentence don t bother while these things can be tactful at times they can also be unnecessary at others if you re looking to show you re confident in you you want to abandon the lingual niceties if your boss were to say you know i was thinking that perhaps we should go in a different direction i know it ll be a huge inconvenience and i m so sorry but i really think this is a good idea don t you how would you interpret that now if they were to say guys listen up we gotta go in a different direction it s gonna be work but it ll be worth it whaddaya say how would you interpret that bingo don t be afraid of silence you know that awkward first date where the conversation kinda hits a lull and both parties scramble to find something interesting to say to kill the awkward silence don t don t worry about it you want em hanging on your every word if you re talking the entire time they re gonna be hanging on the edge of their seats so they re closer to the door so choose your words they re more powerful that way speak clearly every word out of your mouth should be audible don t let your sentences trail off like see how terrible that is you believe in your words so there s no need to hide them speak clearly so you can be heard otherwise why bother talking let s take that same example guys listen up we gotta go in a different direction it s gonna be work but it ll be worth it whaddaya say good that s good stuff now imagine it like this uhh hey guys listen up we like gotta go in a different um direction yeah uhh it s gonna be you know work and stuff but it ll be worth it that s a big fat no don t hem and haw you re confident in your point so spit it out get comfortable you may lie on your back on the floor or otherwise place yourself in a comfortable position make sure that nothing will distract you unplug your phone close your door ask people not to disturb you etc close your eyes and pay attention to your breath

people close to you maintain your presence when walking around school work or outside people may comment that you look a little different do not be discouraged it is likely that tensions will return just be sure not to judge yourself this is a process and is different for each person notice the tension and allow yourself to release it when you walk down the street try to make prolonged eye contact with strangers to show alpha male mentality force them to react in a particular way just allow an expression to move through your body check in afterwards did your smile stick did the tension return to your face or body practice this until you remain relaxed when you greet strangers in all situations it is important to maintain your presence if you have anxiety or fear acknowledge it and

how to make a cd mix,people have been making song mixes since the technology was first available and even now cd mixes are a common part of the culture if you have never made a cd mix before you may not know where to start but the process will be easier than you think one aspect is considering the point of the cd and choosing the songs and the second aspect is the actual burning of the cd by considering your audience thinking about a theme and a message brainstorming the track list and digging into the songs you can make the perfect cd mix then all that s left is using a program like itunes or windows media player to burn the cd and you ll be all set,determine your audience make the mix cd with someone specific in mind whether this is yourself someone you like romantically or just a friend you want to share some music with having a clear idea of who the cd is meant for will help you choose the songs you want the person who listens to this cd to enjoy it so consider what they already like and include some of that additionally you can take a chance and add songs that you think they will like based on what you know they like 1 x research source pick a theme the best mix cds will have some kind of overall theme that ties the songs together rather than being a completely random and disconnected set of songs common themes might be songs about love or songs for a road trip but a theme could be starting a new school year becoming friends or inspiring music for a workout having a theme in mind helps establish the mood you hope the cd achieves and gives you something to aim for in compiling the songs 2 x research source you might have the theme of songs for the weekend in mind but don t just add a bunch of songs that have weekend in the title a theme is about continuity of the songs tone and content not just titles that have words in common make the message clear if you are making the cd for a particular person or occasion it should have a message that the songs all work together to send the theme gives a general guideline of how the songs should fit together while the message is what you want the mix to actually say the audience also plays a large part in crafting the message because you probably don t want a mix for your boyfriend to send the same message as a mix for your grandma 3 x research source brainstorm the track list before you start putting the songs into a playlist you should spend time thinking of what songs you want browse through your music collection and start writing down songs that catch your eye with the audience and theme in mind if you consider some songs you haven t heard in a long time play those and see if they fit with your intended feel don t worry about writing down more songs than you need because you can also narrow the list down later listen to every potential song there s a good chance that you ll pick some songs that you know are great but that you haven t listened to in a while it s good to listen to the songs again just to refresh yourself on how they go maybe there is a lengthy intro that isn t right for this mix or a word of profanity somewhere that you want to avoid listening to the songs also helps you see if it really fits the tone and message of the cd that you are hoping to achieve it is also good to read the lyrics while you listen to make sure you don t miss anything you want to make sure there s not a stray lyric or something you usually don t notice when listening that someone else could pick up on examine lyric books or liner notes included in cds you own or visit one of the many lyrics websites available online manage the length of the cd using cds means working within the storage limitations which for most burnable cds is around 80 minutes when considering what your final mix will be narrow down your list by checking song lengths pick the best set that fills the time available pay attention to the first and last song beginnings and endings don t necessarily make or break the mix but both will likely make an impact on the listener start out with a song that sets the tone you want the cd have and let it move forward from there the last song is what you want the listener to feel once it is over you can go out with a bang or let the tone mellow as the cd closes create peaks and valleys this may be affected by what the purpose of the mix is but for general listening you don t want the mix to be too heavy on one particular tempo or style a whole cd of fast and loud songs might be right for the gym but probably won t be right for a long drive put a few songs in a row that build the intensity and then drop it down during the next couple of songs 4 x research source think of a dj at a wedding reception or other party and mimic their routines by trying to form patterns and keep a wide variety you might use a pattern of fast medium slow or loud average soft but don t repeat the exact pattern for the whole cd break the pattern partway through nurture the mix s flow this is similar to peaks and valleys but with a focus more on content than on style and pacing you want to create a cd that has a sort of unity and put the songs in an order that makes them fit together you wouldn t want to put three days grace s song i hate everything about you next to michael jackson s the way you make me feel try to put songs next to each with lyrical content that seems somewhat similar rather than completely opposite 5 x research source this is much more of an art than a science so it will not be perfect you just want the mix to feel like it was put together in a specific way on purpose not a bunch of songs that are on shuffle create a playlist with itunes open click the word file in the top left corner a drop down list should appear and you ll find the option that says new hover over that and you ll see playlist click that a new playlist will appear in the list on the side of the window go ahead and name it something that tells the purpose of the mix you are making if you work on this project in multiple sittings you want to remember which playlist you are working on if you have multiple playlists 6 x research source add the songs you want on the cd assuming the music you want to put on the mix is already in your itunes search through and find the songs then drag them over to the playlist for right now the order that you add them in is not important because you can go through and reorder once the songs are in the playlist 7 x research source if some of the songs you want to include on the cd are not already in your music library you may need to add those songs you can either import them from cds you have or download them from itunes order the songs once you have all of the songs you want in your playlist you need to rearrange them into the order you want you can do this by clicking and holding on the song and dragging it to the position you want it in when you get the songs to a place where you think they ll fit well listen to the beginnings and endings of the songs to see if they transition well from one to the next insert a blank cd assuming your computer is equipped with a cd burner a window might pop up asking what you want to do and if there is a burn cd option click that if not go back up to file and click the option that says burn playlist to disc you can also hold ctrl and click on the playlist title and the option to burn playlist to disc should appear click that choose your settings when you click burn playlist to disc a new window with burn settings should appear and you ll have some options you can leave everything as default and simply hit burn or you can change the time gap between songs file type and sound levels if you are new to burning cds it is best to leave the settings alone and hit burn 8 x research source wait for the disc to finish once you ve clicked burn your work is pretty much done itunes will begin burning your disc which takes a varying amount of time depending on how many songs you ve chosen and how fast your computer is in general it takes 5 10 minutes your computer may eject the disc automatically when it is finished burning or you may have to hit eject manually insert a blank cd with media player open insert a blank cd into your disc drive you ll most likely want to be using a cd r as this is a basic cd used for burning audio tracks some sort of window with options may pop up but close it for now 9 x research source click the burn tab click the tab at the top that says burn this will open a panel on the right side of your screen that will be the place where you drag the songs you want to burn this tab does not start burning the cd it simply opens the panel for you to make the song list compile the playlist if you have made a playlist in media player ahead of time you can drag the whole playlist and it will add to the burn list if you still need to search through your library and find them do so and drag each one to the

how to find inspiration to write songs,the dreaded writer s block is something all songwriters have to deal with from time to time luckily there are many sources of inspiration out there from drawing on your own experiences and emotions to creative writing exercises there are many methods to get you back on your songwriting game,write about yourself your life experience memories opinions emotions is your richest resource and your perspective is what will ultimately make your song unique keeping a list of things that happen to you or emotions that go through you will give you a wealth of material to draw on 1 x research source for example keep note of stories that you hear or experience 2 x research source they are a great source of material not only because they are unique but also because they have a range of emotions write about your emotions think about an emotionally charged event in your life such as a death wedding birth falling in love etc do your best to describe what you felt at that time and try to be as detailed as possible for example if writing about a breakup list words that describe the scene how you felt the surroundings what colors stood out to you etc don t worry about rhyme or melody yet keep a journal many of us go through our days and only write down notes lists emails and the like but keeping a journal will allow you to reflect on what you are going through and provide you with material from which you can mine different images and phrases for your songs write down your dreams many of us have strange abstract dreams that we quickly forget about after waking up instead of letting go of those interesting images and unusual situations keep a dream journal not only will writing down your dreams help you remember them for longer but you ll have a new repository of strange and unique stories and images to use for your songs keep a pen and journal by your bed so that you can write down your dreams as soon as you wake up leave the house go for walks in public places and look at other people or your surroundings for inspiration lots of songwriters write about nature other people or interesting experiences get out there and let the world inspire you try eavesdropping sometimes listening in on someone else s conversation can open you up to a new perspective you may even find something intriguing or lyrical in their words if there s a place you feel particularly emotionally connected to such as a park go there with a pen and paper sit down and write whatever comes to mind try something new many musicians lead very interesting lives that also serve as inspiration for their lyrics 3 x research source get out of your comfort zone and try something new whatever the outcome it ll certainly give you something to write about trying new things can give you an adrenaline rush which can be inspiring you can do something extreme like skydiving or something simple like trying a new recipe 4 x research source be nostalgic look at old photo albums reread old letters visit family and childhood friends and talk about the past nostalgia is a very powerful mix of emotions and from these activities can emerge many stories and emotions to draw on listen to music this may seem obvious but listening to music and paying attention to the song lyrics will not only teach you more about the mechanics of successful song lyrics but can also be inspiring take a walk and listen to music without lyrics this can help inspire you to come up with new lyrics if you come up with good lines write them down listen to the music that inspired you to start songwriting doing so will help you know what to emulate and what to avoid in your own songs pay attention to the classics iconic songwriters from quincy jones to woody guthrie attained their status for a reason note the lyrics arrangement and structure 5 x research source listen to new types of music broadening your musical horizons will inspire you to incorporate new sounds or styles that you wouldn t have otherwise considered explore other art forms you don t have to limit yourself to music for inspiration try to consume as much art as possible in all its different forms as doing so can inspire you in unexpected ways watch movies read books go to art galleries anything creative can feed your own artistic spirit reading poetry is a great place to start because it is most similar to song lyrics reading literature has the added benefit of expanding your vocabulary which you can also use in your own songs 6 x research source pay attention to unconventional art forms inspiration is all around us as long as we are open to it from street art to experimental theatre the more you get out of your comfort zone the more exciting possible inspirations you may find for example you could look at the graffiti in your area many street artists make public art for a variety of reasons such as raising political awareness 7 x research source note any descriptions phrases or emotions that come to mind discomfort isn t always a bad thing new experiences can make you uncomfortable but they can also inspire you to produce new exciting work especially if you feel like you re creating the same thing over and over 8 x research source experiment with different writing exercises there are many different writing exercises one can use to get inspired if you re feeling really stumped and don t know where to start try a writing exercise having a specific set of instructions can take the pressure off and get those creative juices flowing if you feel intimidated tell yourself that you ll only write for 5 minutes if nothing comes out you ll know that you ve at least tried if you find yourself settling into the writing process after 5 minutes you re likely to come out with at least a few ideas you re happy with try writing about an object this is a songwriting exercise called choose an object used at the berklee college of music and can be very helpful in generating new ideas for this exercise choose an object at random then spend 10 minutes or so writing any memories you associate with it don t worry about making it sound good or writing complete sentences focus on using as many different senses as possible you ll end up with a list of images and emotions which you can use as inspiration later on 9 x research source try a david bowie approved exercise bowie has described one of his methods for songwriting and you may want to give it a try to see if it works for you this exercise can be particularly useful for those times when you just have no idea what you want to write about write 1 to 2 paragraphs different subjects to create a sort of short story next cut the sentences into sections of 4 of 5 different blocks then mix them up and reconnect them find a quiet space to work in though we often think of inspiration as something that just strikes us a certain level of discipline is also necessary to create polished song lyrics having a set place to focus and be creative can motivate you to keep up a regular practice of songwriting something as simple as a desk can be a great place to write you can even decorate the space with some of your favorite musical inspirations to keep you inspired studies have shown that the color blue can enhance performance on a creative task 10 x research source try repainting your space blue or have blue decorations in your space to keep you going decide on a writing routine some people feel most inspired and excited to write first thing in the morning while other people find the evening time to be best for their creativity figure out what time of the day works for you bearing in mind other responsibilities such as your job and schoolwork and decide on a writing routine accordingly 11 x research source schedule this time into a calendar or planner if you use one after a few weeks of consciously doing this it ll eventually become second nature and you ll have a steady flow of written material for your songs minimize distractions it s all too easy to get distracted by social media chores and all the other daily aspects of life that demand our attention however having a specific time and place to do your writing will carve out some space that takes you away from all of that if you use your computer to write make a commitment to not use the internet until you get a set amount of work done 12 x research source if you find yourself constantly itching to look things up turn off the wifi and write notes in your work of what to research once you are done with the rough draft collaborate with others think about who in your life is also engaged in artistic pursuits and ask them if they would be willing to collaborate with you collaborating can be as easy as giving each other feedback on each other s work or even starting a new project together not only will you motivate each other to produce work but you ll also get great feedback and a fresh outlook that will make you a better songwriter 13 x research source your collaborators don t necessarily have to be musicians in fact working with an actor or writer may be even better as you ll get a totally different perspective be proactive about receiving constructive criticism after all you want new good ideas and so don t take criticism personally but instead see them as an opportunity to improve join a writing group if you re having trouble being disciplined about your writing consider joining a writing group writing groups are generally open to all different forms of writing and knowing that you have an audience that is going to read your work and give you feedback can motivate you to just sit down and get that song onto paper oftentimes you can find local writing groups that meet once a month or so to do writing workshops look for ads in cafes or other community spaces if you feel uncomfortable talking about your work in person you can also find online writing groups keep a notebook and pen on you at all times you never know when inspiration will strike so you ll always want to be able to have these important tools handy 14 x research source writing notes down on your phone is a good alternative if you aren t the type to carry a bag around,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to write an art exhibition review,writing an art exhibition review is a creative experience that helps you express your ideas about an artist s work your review will provide a description and critical analysis of an art exhibit this helps visitors know what to expect from the exhibit and gives feedback to the artist to write an effective art exhibition review visit the exhibit take detailed notes and talk to the artist a docent or a curator if possible then discuss your observations and opinions in your review and revise your work before finalizing it,read your assignment sheet before reviewing the exhibit for a class read your assignment sheet at least twice to make sure you understand what your instructor expects they may want you to focus on certain features of the exhibit depending on the topic of the class review the criteria they ll use to grade the assignment so you ll get full credit 1 x research source if you have any questions ask your instructor so that you don t accidentally make an error on your assignment walk through the exhibit gallery to make observations about the art block off 1 2 hours to experience the art exhibit so you have plenty of time to examine the artwork move through the exhibit slowly examining each piece of artwork additionally watch how other people are reacting to the exhibit 2 x research source make several passes through the exhibit so you can make new observations and connections between the works look at the art from different angles and distances while it s important to examine each piece closely you also want to take in the entire exhibit as a whole to see how the artist evoked their theme take notes on the description form content and your impressions be as detailed as possible so you can use your notes to write the full review write down the medium materials and techniques used to create the piece then note the title and theme of each work finally record your reaction to the art how it made you feel and what worked or didn t work within the piece 3 x research source document how the artist created each image such as how they used lines shapes colors shading textures patterns and light you ll use this information to develop your discussion on form identify the main idea and important themes of the exhibit write down your own impressions of the exhibit s main idea and themes then read the artist statement and exhibit description provided by the gallery to learn the artist s intended themes compare your interpretation of the exhibit to the artist s intentions 4 x research source ask yourself questions like the following based on what i see what do i think the artist is trying to say what does the exhibit make me think about how do i feel talk to a docent or curator to learn more about the exhibit a docent or curator will have more in depth knowledge about the exhibit that they ll be happy to share a docent can tell you the information they normally point out to visitors similarly a curator can give you more insight into the installation process and the challenges they faced ask to talk to a docent or curator and take notes on what they say 5 x research source ask a docent questions like what was the artist hoping to achieve in this exhibit what inspired the artist to create these works and what are the core pieces of this exhibit ask a curator questions like why did you arrange the artwork like this what challenges did you face while installing the exhibit and what instructions did the artist give for hanging their work notice how others are reacting to the art for the spectator response while you don t need to include spectator responses in your review it may help you bolster your own critique of the show similarly it might help you make your review more relatable if you re writing it for a publication watch how others are reacting to the exhibit and write down the things you hear them say 6 x research source for instance do you notice visitors avoiding a certain piece are they drawn to some pieces more than others which pieces are generating conversation what types of comments do you overhear if you re planning to publish your review ask fellow visitors to give you quotes that you can use for your review get their name so you can credit them talk to the artist if they re present at the exhibit if you attend on opening night you may meet the artist if so chat with them about what inspired their work what they hope the audience will experience and how they created their work take notes on what they say so you can use this information to write your review 7 x research source wait until after you view the exhibit so that your initial impressions aren t influenced by the artist read other reviews on the exhibition to find out what critics are saying do a quick internet search to find out what other critics are saying about the exhibit if it s a traveling exhibit look at the reviews from prior installations use their ideas to help you complete your own analysis of the exhibit but make sure you draw your own conclusions 8 x research source your review should focus on your own ideas not on what other people said answer the who what where when and why this will provide your reader with a general overview of the exhibit and where they can find it tell the reader who the artist is what style of art they make where the exhibit is when it takes place and why people might be interested in the show include this information in your paper s introduction 9 x research source write agatha tompkin s the friends you have opened at the contemporary art center on friday august 23rd and runs through november 1st her watercolors and mixed media works explore modern relationships and how communities differ describe the exhibit so visitors know what to expect from it discuss the physical specifications of the art the form and its content additionally explain how the artwork is installed in the gallery such as how it s hung or displayed then specify how visitors can interact with the work 10 x research source you might say tompkin s watercolors are grouped on two adjacent walls in simple 11 by 14 in 28 by 36 cm black frames hanging on the opposite walls her mixed media work consists of 5 by 7 ft 1 5 by 2 1 m canvases that are arranged in a line visitors can walk alongside the artwork for a visual experience present a critical analysis of the exhibit and its thesis discuss your opinions about the exhibit and how well the artist presented their ideas and themes explain whether or not the exhibit provides new interpretations or fails to realize its goal support your analysis with facts or observations from the exhibit 11 x research source explain the artist s stated thesis and how well they expressed it in their exhibit identify parts of the exhibit that worked well if there were works that didn t support the main idea explain how the artist could have better incorporated them consider how this exhibit relates to art history as a whole where would it fit in how does this art compare to existing works how does it express common themes discuss the challenges the curator may have faced during installation you may be able to omit this information if the exhibit was easy to hang however an exhibit that has large pieces moving parts or a wall installation may be hard to hang consider what the curator had to do to install the exhibit and how it may have differed from past shows then explain these challenges in your review 12 x research source for instance a curator may not face any unique challenges while hanging framed oil paintings on a wall however they might struggle with installing a sculpture that hangs from the ceiling or an installation that has moving parts you might write while the framed watercolors were easy to hang on the exhibit walls the curators struggled to install the single mixed media sculpture that tompkins created from found objects the sculpture is designed to look like it s floating between the ceiling and the floor so it must be hung using thin wires follow the formatting instructions for your assignment use the formatting instructions provided by your instructor or publisher this might include using standard 1 in 2 5 cm margins double spacing and 12 pt times new roman or arial font however check your assignment sheet to make sure 13 x research source if this is for class your instructor likely told you which style guide to use format your paper and any citations that you use according to the rules for that style guide ask a fellow art student or critic to give you feedback on your work give your review to someone who has experience in writing art exhibition reviews so you can get feedback ask them to identify areas that need improvement as well as errors that need to be corrected use their feedback to revise your paper 14 x research source don t ask someone who s unfamiliar with art exhibition reviews to critique your paper because they may unintentionally give you bad advice revise your review if changes are necessary after you get feedback go through your paper and improve areas that aren t working well address areas that the reviewer pointed out but also revise sentences that you think could be better stated 15 x research source reading your review aloud will help you spot areas that don t flow well re write these sentences to make them better proofread your review before submitting it after you complete your final draft read over it again to make sure there are no typos or other errors read it out loud to make it easier to notice mistakes then correct your paper if necessary 16 x research source try to get someone else to proofread it for you because it s hard to spot your own errors,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to deconstruct a text,deconstruction aims to disturb in order to discover by deconstructing a text you learn to read beyond a text s straightforward content and uncover new meanings and truths deconstruction has intellectual and political implications deconstructing a text is a common assignment given to students of literature literary theory film communications or postmodernist thought whenever deconstruction finds a nutshell a secure axiom or a pithy maxim the very idea is to crack it open and disturb this tranquility john d caputo,look for the assumptions an article entitled how to deconstruct a text likely assumes a text can be deconstructed and also that that deconstruction can be described in a systematic way that applies to all texts similarly neither of these assumptions may be true look for what assumptions the writer makes that already bias the interpretation of the meanings the text discusses look for the tension between the spirit and the letter of the text a text is rarely entirely successful in conveying the spirit of the writer while the letter of the text is invariably ambiguous as to the intended meaning the spirit behind the title how to deconstruct a text is one of helpfulness yet despite this optimism deconstruction can be a difficult concept to grasp while how tos are also notorious for being inadequate incomplete misleading a one size fits all solution that rarely fits even a single context adequately there is potentially a direct contradiction and tension here between what the author intends and what the text ends up saying such disconnects can lead to misinterpretations to a literal translation of the meaning which one assumes is automatically a false interpretation such separation between the spirit of the text and the actual text itself are inevitable in any text but revealing them empowers the reader and avoids the pitfall of a text literally falling into decay into an almost eternal misinterpretation likewise a text is itself an attempt to author reality and there is a tension that inevitably comes with that consider the dynamic and static elements of meaning one way to approach the meanings of text is to realise that we construct meanings in our heads dynamically they are subject to constant revision extension refutation qualification or summary in our heads a physical text on the other hand has a static character even while the writer attempts to recreate the dynamic elements of a thought process as a project to construct meaning a sentence or paragraph must eventually end while a thought process can potentially continue endlessly in developing or modifying meanings a text constructs a reality an author and even a reader that are inevitably fraudulent because they are in many ways dead in comparison to that which they point to in sum people are alive texts are dead but a text gives the illusion of life but something is inevitably lost in the process deconstruction attempts to fill in this gap by making it clear how the text comes to life through the reader s interpretation and through the manipulations of the author consider how the text is made irrelevant imagine an alien landed on earth the mere fact of being an alien would bring great scrutiny and learning even though the alien would look and talk exactly like us by seeing how a text is made irrelevant we turn the text into an alien object and thereby bring to bear an intensified level of scrutiny disturb in order to discover rather than take the context of the text for granted we seek to find the limits of meaning built into the text the point at which it becomes alien to us and in so doing we discover something new about it consider the individual elements of the text this is often the first step in deconstruction but it can be misleading as it suggests meaning is the sum of separate parts and not something more than the sum of the parts consider how the text uses different kinds of words nouns verbs adverbs etc a text that describes the world using verbs constructs a different kind of world existential than one that focuses on nouns essentialist positivist or adjectives relativist likewise a text that uses verbs like appear seem or ponder give a different sense of reality than one using verbs like is creates proves etc in the deconstruction project every single word is a hypothesis about the world not a statement of fact and reflects as much about the author and even the reader than about the world out there deconstruction aims to make these hypotheses visible look for puns and words with double meaning read your text slowly and methodically do not assume that a first glance reading will supply you with a text s meaning instead resolve to dig deeply into every word or phrase circle any word that might have multiple meanings or that leads to a pun or joke reread any sentence with a double meaning and try to keep both meanings in your head simultaneously use your dictionary to guide you as you uncover the multiple meanings within a text ask yourself does this word have any other definitions besides the standard assumed definition for example the word start can mean to begin it can also mean to become startled the sentence he started when he heard the gun might mean that the man began an action at the gunshot such as beginning a race however it might also mean that the man became startled and scared at the gunshot try to keep both meanings of start in your head while you read is this word etymologically related to other words in the text for example the words inspiration and conspiracy are both related to the latin root word spirae meaning breath does this history help you find additional meaning in these words does the word sound like another word or phrase that is entirely unrelated to it for example the word russian is not etymologically related to rush in in any way however because these words sound a lot alike a reader might connect them in surprising ways leading to additional significance in a text is this word used in a different way elsewhere in the text and how might they be related for example perhaps the word art is used in one chapter to refer to a painting and art is used in another chapter to refer to a person how are art and art alike how are they different hunt for overlooked explanations or definitions deconstruction urges a reader to resist the general common meaning of a text also known as the privileged meaning of a text consider whether a word phrase or text might have alternative explanations that are ignored by many readers are there alternative or minority perspectives that have not been given their due try to expose unconventional ideas and possibilities as you read ask yourself what is unconventional or strange about the text are there any traditions that the text is flouting these traditions might be literary such as using an unconventional structure or political such as inhabiting a feminist perspective 1 x research source how would this text be different if it had been narrated from another character s perspective this is an especially good question to ask if the narrator is a white heterosexual man and there are minor characters who embody minority identities what if this text had taken up the perspective of a woman a person of color or someone who is queer 2 x research source what ideology is being supported by the text does the text seem to suppress any other ideologies for example perhaps the text anxiously supports western imperialism is there anything the text leaves out in order to strengthen its imperialist position 3 x research source what is the text s relationship to seemingly universal truths 4 x research source deconstruction resists the idea that there is one single truth to explain life and language does the text resist these false truths as well for example one generally accepted truth is that people should follow their consciences perhaps a text is arguing that people s consciences are flawed and that morality should be sought elsewhere what hierarchies exist in the text who has the power is there any way that the text overturns hierarchies could you overturn hierarchies through your reading 5 x research source what words could the author have chosen but did not choose are there any gaps or fissures in the text that you can discern 6 x research source push back against the authority of the author resist the temptation to look to the author of a text as the singular expert on the meaning of a given text tell yourself that your own readings ideas translations and even your misreadings are just as meaningful as the author s interpretation of her own work the act of reading is creative not passive you should not defer to any single authoritative explanation for a text s meaning 7 x research source embrace ambiguity playfulness and contradictions deconstruction resists the idea that language follows a straightforward formula as it creates meaning 8 x research source instead language is strange funny disturbing and paradoxical tell yourself that deconstruction does not involve finding the one true meaning of a work of literature you might find that a text means two opposite things at the same time this does not mean that the text is wrong or that you have misread the text look at the text as presenting a multiplicity of truths expect to find jokes playful puns disturbing ideas and paradoxes when you deconstruct a text examine the text in another order texts are usually read from beginning to end however that kind of linear thinking might obscure other hidden meanings within the text such as surprising connections double meanings and puns consider disrupting a linear reading of a text by skimming through it backwards jumping around from chapter to chapter and reading certain phrases and sentences in isolation reading a text in a nonlinear fashion can bring it to life in new and unexpected ways 9 x research source resist western cultural binaries deconstruction argues that language contains political claims that disguise their own politics in other words that seemingly straightforward language is a mask for pernicious and arbitrary power structures one of the clearest ways these power dynamics play out in language is through a system of western cultural binaries or opposites that create problematic hierarchies 10 x research source deconstruction can help make visible certain problematic invisible assumptions in language and culture in order to deconstruct a text learn how to get beyond a simplistic system of binaries that culture creates and that language might try to uphold try to see where there are shades of grey where seeming opposites are actually very closely related or where the superior side of the binary system might in fact be inferior these binaries include the following men vs women or masculine vs feminine culture vs nature soul mind vs body reason vs emotion white people vs people of color adult vs child good literature like shakespeare vs bad literature like a romance novel apply deconstruction to any text if you are deconstructing a text for a school assignment you will probably apply this method to a literary text such as a poem play short story or novel however deconstruction can be applied to any text or any speech act movies advertisements political speeches how to articles and billboards can all be deconstructed too look at the world around you as one made of deeply meaningful text that you have the power to decode if you take the time distill your observations into a claim if you are deconstructing a text as part of an assignment you might have to write up your findings this can be a difficult task because

how to cut a picture mat,mats are used in framing photographs and artwork to center the focus of the picture and give it a sense of spatial depth the addition of a sleek well cut mat can greatly enhance the look of any framed picture but having a mat cut and frame made commercially can sometimes cost more than the picture itself a cheaper solution is to learn to cut your own mat frames using a handful of basic materials that allow you to fully customize the look of your framed picture for a fraction of the cost,have the picture you want to frame ready take a look at the picture and get an idea of what size mat and or frame you ll need the completed project will consist of your picture sandwiched between two uniformly sized mats with the center of the frontal mat cut to display the picture you ll need at least two pieces of mat board one to serve as the backing for the picture and the other to cut a window frame that wraps around the front side of the picture larger pictures like artwork headed for exhibition will obviously require larger mats but the exact specifications of the mat will also depend on how much of it you want to be visible around the picture decide on a style of mat that you like mats come in many different colors designs and thicknesses pick a mat or a number of mats if you choose to utilize multiple layers you like that is a good look for the picture you ll be framing then decide whether the mat will go around the edges of the picture in the frame or serve as a frame itself if you think the picture you re framing might benefit from the added depth of multiple layered window frame mats select the mats in color and texture combinations that complement each other 1 x research source mat board comes in many different thicknesses the thicker the mat you choose for cutting the wider and deeper the white line created by the mat s inner material will be around the edges of the finished piece consequently thicker mat types might look better in plain white to hide the cut inner edges mat board is also available in two general quality ranges standard mat board is fine for photographs and prints that aren t meant to be professionally displayed while archival mat board is exhibition quality and therefore costs more archival mat board should be used with original artwork especially when they re done on archival materials with artist grade art supplies choose a cutting implement to cut the mat you ll need a sharp blade capable of cutting perfectly straight lines the most readily available and least expensive option is a standard razor blade or box cutter with a fixed handle you can also purchase a specialty sliding mat cutter tool but these tend to be more costly and require more of a learning curve to use without making mistakes razor blades x acto knives and box cutters all make use of extremely sharp exposed blades be very cautious when handling these tools mat cutting kits can be purchased at most art stores and make it easier to measure align and cut mats in a single station but will run you considerably more money 2 x research source acquire a ruler or t square the ruled edge will be used to measure the mat to fit the picture and frame and to assist in cutting straight edges the t square has the added benefit of enabling you to measure precise angles you ll also need the ruler or t square to keep the width of all sides of the mat consistent heavy metal rulers will work better as they provide some weight to hold the mat steady beneath them and you won t have to worry about damaging them with your cutting tool measure the picture you want to frame use the ruler to measure the height and width of the picture you ll be cutting the mat to fit both of the mats you cut should match the dimension of the picture exactly the inner area of the second window frame mat will need to be cut at least a half inch smaller than the picture itself to hold it in place write down the picture s dimensions and set it aside for now during this step you can decide how wide you want to cut your window mat to go on top of the picture if only a portion of the picture needs to be visible a wider mat will fill in the non focal area around the edges and let you center the picture exactly where you want it measure the frame if you have a frame picked out that you want to use remove the glass or plastic from the front and extract the backing board the backing board is what you will be using for reference as the mats will be measured and cut to fit the inner part of the frame where the picture sits copy down the dimensions of the frame making sure to differentiate what the various measurements are for 3 x research source most frames you buy will already have their specifications listed disregard this measurement and take your own since it s imperative that the mat you cut be able to fit the frame it s better not to take chances with sizing choose a size for the window mat with the dimensions of the picture or artwork in mind decide what size will work best for cutting the window mat the window mat will be placed around the edges of the front side of the picture and will usually overlap the picture slightly so settle on a window mat size that doesn t obscure too much of the picture on the back of the second mat board trace the measurements of the picture where you plan to cut the window frame 4 x trustworthy source library of congress official library of the u s and main research institution for congress and the american public go to source for most small to medium sized pictures a window mat with a width of around 5 1 5 will provide a nice frame for the picture without covering too much of it mark the first mat where it is to be cut refer back to the dimensions of the frame backing board you measured earlier using these measurements place the ruler or t square along the first edge of the mat and mark with a pencil on the back side of the mat where the cutting edge is to be start at the top edge of the mat and make a small notch every few inches this will give you a dotted line to follow as you cut and can help you realign the cutting trajectory if the ruler is to slip at any point always mark and cut from the back side of the mat that way none of your marks or cutting imperfections will be visible on the finished mat surface cut the first backing mat take the razor box cutter or mat cutter tool and line it up with the edge of the ruler make sure the cutting edge is flush with the ruler if you re using a mat cutter tool it will be a sliding attachment with its own ruled edge to ensure that the cutter doesn t slip when cutting manually be sure to press firmly against the ruler or t square to keep it from moving as you cut cut the mat with a slow steady motion applying equal pressure throughout the whole movement repeat the cutting process on the remaining three sides of the mat checking again that the length and width are accurate and that you re cutting the right amount 5 x research source bear down hard when cutting the mat it s best to go all the way through on the first pass to keep the cut clean and straight but if that s not possible then make several lighter passes watching for crooked cuts to continue a cut that is only partially complete push down vertically with your blade until you go all the way through adjust the angle of the blade and resume cutting remember safety first severe injury can result from improper use of cutting tools cut slowly and keep all appendages out of the path of the blade cut the second window frame mat cut the second mat board to the exact specifications of the first you ll be using this mat as the window frame for the front of the picture if you ve selected a mat of a fanciful color or design it should be the one you use for the window mat as it will be front and center in the frame and complement the aesthetic of the picture once again let the ruler edge guide you as you carefully cut out the four sides of the window frame the outer dimensions of the window frame should be the same of the backing mat as they will be fitted together the inner dimensions are a matter of preference but generally a 5 1 5 window frame looks best create layered mats if you want to create a more complex layered look cut multiple window frame mats each approximately 5 to 1 smaller than the previous one arrange the mats concentrically around the picture when using layered mats you can alternate various colors or designs making the space around the picture deeper and more ornate 6 x research source when layering mats be sure that you re measuring and cutting each mat separately and unless it s part of the design keep the size variations between the mats consistent secure the mats place the picture against the backing mat and then center the window frame mat over it once you ve lined up both mats and made sure the picture is centered take small strips of artist s tape and lightly stick the mat halves together flip the matted picture over and tape across the back edges you can then remove the strips of tape from the front and the mats will be secured around the picture that s it insert the newly matted picture into the frame or let the mats act as a rough frame themselves if you prefer stick the tape to a piece of fabric before applying it to the mat if the tape is too tacky you might tear the mat or picture when removing it it s recommended that you find an actual covered frame for original artwork once it s been matted otherwise you risk damaging or smudging the art if it s left exposed,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to be a good ventriloquist,ventriloquism is the art of making an inanimate object seem to come alive the first step in becoming a good ventriloquist is to choose a puppet that matches the character you are trying to create you ll also need to work on throwing your voice using a different accent or tone and speaking without moving your lips animating your puppet is another aspect of ventriloquism so practice moving the puppet s mouth and body in time with what they are saying develop a routine and dialogue between yourself and the puppet complete with good jokes keep practicing and have fun,research other ventriloquists watch videos or go to a live show that another ventriloquist is putting on you can pick up some tips and learn what works and what s funny and what s not jeff dunham ronn lucas jay johnson or terry fator are examples of excellent ventriloquists that you can learn from take ventriloquist lessons if you truly want to be a ventriloquist it s a great idea to take a few lessons you ll learn about the types of puppets available as well as how to move them realistically these lessons also focus on voice techniques and can help you learn how to talk without moving your lips like a pro look online to find ventriloquist lessons near you 1 x research source study the performing arts ventriloquists are performers so it s only natural to study the performing arts take theatre improv music or acting classes to hone your skills as a performer you can also take voice lessons comedy or comedic writing classes would also be incredibly helpful for putting together a funny skit do an internet search to find classes in your area 2 x research source decide what kind of partner you want you can choose a person or an animal as your partner however you must always make sure that the puppet s personality is different from your own to give the illusion that you are not the same person for instance if you are a kind responsible person make your partner a mischievous jokester 3 x research source if you are athletic and love watching sports make your partner someone who hates watching football and loves going to the opera instead make your partner a scientist or mathematician if you are someone who prefers painting or sculpting instead think about what kind of routine you wish to create and what personality would complement yours the best for creating this routine find a puppet that will fit that character look at the puppets shape size age and facial features also take note of their clothing and accessories choose a puppet that fits the character you created for your partner for example if your imagined character is a young energetic boy don t pick a puppet that s an old man or a young lady if you imagined a sad mangy dog as your partner don t choose a shiny happy looking pup 4 x research source you can choose a puppet with a hard figure made out of wood or soft figure such as a cloth doll as well as a novelty figure like a jalapeno you can find a wide array of puppets to choose from online choose a puppet with a moving head there are many different control schemes for puppets but one with a moving head is excellent for beginners choose one where you put your hand in the back grab a stick attached to the head and push a trigger to move the mouth this is key when animating your puppet and works better than a puppet that uses a string on the neck to operate the mouth 5 x research source some puppets have other features including the ability to move their eyebrows lips ears and eyes convince yourself that your puppet is alive you should act as though the puppet is alive from the moment you pick it out don t treat your puppet like a doll or toy instead treat them like a part of your family play games with your partner watch tv with them and bring them to family get togethers 6 x research source create a life and backstory for your puppet have your puppet tell you stories about their life and experiences ask questions about their likes and dislikes family education goals hopes and dreams even though you are technically making this up it will help you believe that there is life in your partner 7 x research source direct the audience s eyes toward the puppet when they are speaking ventriloquism like magic uses misdirection to make an act believable if the audience is looking at the puppet they won t see that you are in fact the one who is speaking move your puppet s mouth in time with every syllable of the words you are saying and use their arms or body to gesture appropriately throughout their speech 8 x research source be sure that the head isn t moving too much while they speak or this will distract the audience from the actual speech try to observe real people as they speak and have your partner mimic those movements keep your puppet moving it s important to keep your puppet moving even when you are speaking to help the audience believe that they are real also be sure the amount that they are moving is consistent with their character for example if they are young and energetic have their head move quickly and shake while they re speaking if they are an older person or a sleepy child move their head slowly and not as often 9 x research source if your partner only moves their head they will seem unrealistic to the audience move the rest of their body as well for example have them shift around on your knee or the stool they are sitting on slump over or stretch learn to speak without moving your lips go through the alphabet without moving your lips you ll notice that the letters b f m p q v and w will make your lips move to say these without moving your lips you must use substitutions for b say d or geh for f say th for m say n nah or neh for p say kl or t for q say koo for v say th and for w say ooh 10 x research source you may think the new words with the substituted letters sound ridiculous but if you learn to put stress on the syllables that don t contain these letters the words will begin to sound more natural hold a finger over your mouth as if trying to tell someone to be quiet to help prevent your lips from moving gritting your teeth together may also help practice throwing your voice take a deep breath in through your nose raise your tongue so it is near but not touching the soft palate at the roof of your mouth contract your diaphragm by tightening your stomach muscles and keep your airway constricted so breath is trapped in your throat speak while exhaling slowly so that your voice sounds distant 11 x research source change your voice a convincing vent voice must be very different from yours listen to yourself speak do you speak loudly or softly fast or slow do you have a low voice or a high voice try to make your puppet s voice different from yours in all or most of these categories to change your voice you must speak from a different area such as your nose or throat 12 x research source one excellent way to change your voice is to force air through your nose instead of your mouth when you speak another option is to force the sound from the diaphragm tighten your stomach muscles when speaking for a deeper raspier voice choose your vent voice carefully depending on the puppet you chose think about whether your puppet s character would have an accent or a different way of speaking than you do if your puppet is smart and witty have them speak eloquently without stuttering if they are unintelligent or slow have them speak in a low slow voice 13 x research source the voice you choose helps to amplify your puppet s personality and brings them to life for example if you re from the south you may want to create a fast talking yankee voice for your partner alternatively you could choose a relaxed french accent to complement your own midwestern way of speech create believable dialogue you ll need to have a realistic conversation with your puppet on stage listen to the way you and friends talk to each other or pay attention to other people s conversations add pauses ums and ers sighs and huffs into your conversations not only will these things make your dialogue more believable they are easy to do without moving your lips 14 x research source practice interrupting your puppet and your puppet interrupting you to make your dialogue more believable practice your routine though some people may be able to easily do an improv skit it s best if you prepare and practice your jokes and routine ahead of time work on throwing your voice and speaking without moving your lips in addition to moving your puppet realistically and in time with what they are saying 15 x research source practice every day if you want to make ventriloquism your career watch yourself in a mirror or on film practice in front of a mirror so you can see what the audience will see alternatively you could record your performance and then watch it play back to get a good idea of how you look and sound to the audience tweak your routine based on these practice sessions so that you are fully prepared for a live show develop a strong stage presence people enjoy watching others that have charisma keep an optimistic attitude and display positive energy you and your puppet can make use of the space on stage make eye contact with various members of the audience and be animated throughout your routine use lots of gestures and facial expressions to draw people s attention to you and your puppet 16 x research source choose an outfit that makes you feel comfortable and confident and do the same for your puppet you could have your puppet choose a member of the audience to speak to people will enjoy being included in the show have fun with it a big factor in being a good ventriloquist is having passion if the audience can tell that you are having a good time they will have a good time too whether you are taking up ventriloquism for fun or for a career make sure you are enjoying it always entertain people in good humor rather than using your puppet to lash out at specific groups or people,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to calculate the time signature of a song,time signatures are an important component of any piece of music as they tell you the beats for the song while they can seem deceptively simple they can get more complicated when you re trying to work them out based on the music you see or hear before you get into that make sure you know the basics of what makes up a time signature making it easier to see or hear it when you need to,distinguish between simple and compound time signatures find the time signature at the beginning of the song just after the treble or base clef a simple time signature means a regular note not a dotted one gets the beat such as a quarter note half note or whole note in a compound time signature dotted notes get the beat such as a dotted quarter note dotted half note and so on the main way to identify a compound meter is to look at the upper number for a compound meter it must be 6 or higher and a multiple of 3 1 x research source following the rule of compound meters 6 4 is a compound meter because there s a 6 on top which is multiple of 3 3 8 however is a simple meter because the top number is less than 6 time signatures are also referred to as meter signatures and the time signatures tell you the meter for the song when looking at the top number it tells you the type of meter of the song 2 simple double 3 simple triple 4 simple quadruple 6 compound double 8 compound triple and 12 compound quadruple identify what note gets the beat in a simple time signature by looking at the bottom number the bottom number in a simple time signature tells you which note gets the beat for instance 4 indicates the quarter note gets the beat while 2 indicates a half note gets the beat 2 x research source the bottom numbers in a simple time signature always refer to a specific note getting a single beat a 1 on the bottom tells you the whole note gets the beat 2 means the half note is equal to 1 beat 4 shows you the quarter note has the beat when you see an 8 that means the eighth note lasts 1 beat finally a sixteen tells you the sixteenth note gets the beat 3 x research source for instance 4 4 time is a simple time signature the 4 on the bottom tells you the quarter note gets the beat figure out which dotted note gets the beat in compound time signatures in compound meters it s a little more complicated as you could describe it 2 ways a dotted note always gets the beat but you can also look at it as a division of a dotted note divided into 3 shorter notes of equal length 4 x research source for instance each of these bottom numbers tells you the following in a compound meter a 4 means the dotted half note gets the beat which can be divided into 3 quarter notes 8 tells you the dotted quarter note gets the beat which is equal to 3 eighth notes a 16 shows you the dotted eighth note has the beat equal to 3 sixteenth notes 6 8 time is a compound time signature the 8 tells you a dotted quarter note gets the beat however you could also say that a single beat is composed of 3 eighth notes the same length as a dotted quarter note 5 x research source figure out how many beats are in a measure the top number tells you how many beats each measure gets in simple meters just read the number to get the beats per measure in compound meters divide the number by 3 to get the beats per measure 6 x research source for instance 2 4 has 2 beats per measure and 3 4 has 3 beats per measure both are simple meters with compound meters 6 8 has 2 beats per measure while 9 12 has 3 beats per measure learn the basic note values when discussing note values you generally assume 4 4 time because that is the most common time signature in that case the quarter note is the one that s filled in with a stem and it gets 1 beat half notes are 2 beats and are hollow with a stem while whole notes are just a hollow circle equal to 4 beats eighth notes are half a beat and they have a filled in circle with a little flag at the top right of the stem though sometimes they are connected to each other at the top 7 x research source rests also get beats the same as their note equivalents a quarter rest almost looks like a stylized 3 while a half rest is a little rectangle on top of the middle line a whole rest is a little rectangle below the second line from the top and an eighth rest is a stem with a little flag to the left at the top 8 x research source work out the number of beats in the measure when looking at a piece of music you ll see 5 lines running parallel to each other across the sheet in those lines you ll see vertical lines that divide the music into measures one measure is the space between 2 vertical lines to find the beats in a measure count the notes using a quarter note as the basic beat 9 x research source write the number of beats each note gets above the beat then add them all together for the measure for instance if you have 1 quarter note a half note and a quarter rest you have 4 beats because the quarter note is 1 beat the half note is 2 beats and the quarter rest is 1 beat if you have 4 eighth notes 2 quarter notes and a whole note you have 8 beats the 4 eighth notes equal 2 beats while the 2 quarter notes equal 2 beats and the whole note is 4 beats if you have 2 half notes and 2 quarter notes that s 5 beats as each half note equals 2 beats and the 2 eighth notes equal 1 beat look at the length of the notes to decide which time signature seems best for instance if most of the notes are quarter notes and half notes it may make sense to have the quarter note take the beat if more are eighth notes it may make sense to have the eighth note take the beat basically you want to make it as easy as possible when you re counting the beat and therefore the notes the appear the most should take the beat 10 x research source for example if the notes are 2 quarter notes a half note and a half rest the time signature could be 6 4 or 12 8 in 6 4 the quarter note would get the beat in 12 8 the dotted half note would but you typically see more eighth notes in that time signature as 1 beat is equal to 3 eighth notes in this case 6 4 likely makes more sense if the notes are 2 half notes and 2 quarter notes that could be 2 5 2 5 4 or 10 8 you shouldn t use decimals so 2 5 2 is out 10 8 doesn t make a lot of sense because you don t have any eighth notes so 5 4 is the most likely where you re counting quarter notes as 1 beat 11 x research source aim for the longest note value possible when counting the beats typically when deciding on a time signature try to count the longest note value as the base beat meaning which note gets the beat for instance count half notes as the beat if you can but if that doesn t make sense move on to counting quarter notes as the beat 12 x research source in the example of 2 half notes and 2 quarter notes 2 5 2 would count the half note as the beat but since no decimals are allowed choose the next longest beat which would be the quarter note 13 x research source examine how the eighth notes are grouped to help decide between 4 and 8 when the bottom number of the signature is 4 the eighth notes are often grouped by 2s connected at the top with their flags on the other hand if the eighth notes are in groups of 3s that usually means the bottom number of the time signature is 8 instead 14 x research source start by finding the main pulse or beat when you re listening to a song you may start tapping your foot or nodding your head to the beat this beat is referred to as the pulse what you count to when playing the song start by just finding this beat and tapping along with it 15 x research source see if you can hear an emphasis on certain beats from the percussion often the even beats are given an extra thump or sound particularly in rock or pop music so for instance you may be hearing thump thump thump thump as the beat but then on top of that you hear an extra bit on some beats such as pa thump thump pa thump thump 16 x research source many times the first beat in the measure will be given a stronger emphasis so try to listen for that as well listen for the backbeats to have an emphasis from other instruments even though the drums will often hit the even beats other instruments in the song may hit the backbeats or the odd beats so while you may hear a more solid thudding on the even beats listen for the other beats to have emphasis elsewhere 17 x research source check for major changes on the first beat of the measure for instance you may hear chord changes on the first beat of most measures alternatively you may hear other changes like melody movement or harmony changes often the first note of the measure is where major changes in the song happen 18 x research source it can help to listen for strong and weak notes for instance the beats for duple time 2 4 and 6 8 are strong weak the beats for triple time 3 4 and 9 8 are strong weak weak while for quadruple time 4 4 or c for common time and 12 8 they re strong weak medium weak try to hear how the beats are grouped based on the cues for instance you may notice beats are grouped in 2s 3s or 4s count the beats out if you can listen for the first beat in each measure then count out the notes 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 etc until you hear the first beat of the next measure choose the most likely time signature for the song if you are hearing 4 strong beats in a measure you likely have a 4 4 time signature as that s the most common in pop rock and other popular music remember the bottom 4 tells you the quarter note gets the beat and the top 4 tells you that you have 4 beats in each measure if you feel 2 strong beats but also hear notes in triples behind it you might have a 6 8 time which is counted in 2s but each one of those beats can be divided into 3 eighth notes 2 4 time is most often used in polkas and marches you may hear om pa pa om pa pa in this type of song where the om is a quarter note on the first beat and the pa pa is 2 eighth notes on the second beat another possibility is 3 4 which is often used in waltzes and minuets here you ll hear 3 beats in the measure but you won t hear the triplets you do in 6 8 a triplet is 3 eighth notes,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to read at night,reading at night is a pleasant and calming activity that many people enjoy a few unique challenges can present themselves though and include the risk of inadequate comfort and

back and neck as vertical as possible if you re lying down or sitting on a couch add something helpful such as a horseshoe pillow or a large slanted pillow small neck pillows may be helpful too changing positions every 30 45 minutes can also help you to avoid bad posture and can prevent you from feeling discomfort in your neck or back bring the book closer to your face to help you straighten out your back slightly read light fiction at night to prepare yourself for sleep if you tend to feel sleepy when reading at night avoid reading technical non fiction dense poetry or heavy fiction that asks too much of you intellectually these genres will be hard to follow if you re drowsy so read a light novel or short story at night this will relax your mind and prepare it for sleep and dreaming 2 x research source if you re studying or finalizing work consider doing the tough reading earlier in the night that way you can leave lighter reading for bedtime clip on a book light if you don t want bright lights on in your room many different versions of the clip on book light exist but they all work basically the same way clip the clamp onto the back cover of your book angle the bulb towards the page you re currently reading and switch on the light some book lights are designed to clip on to the edge of your reading glasses instead 3 x research source either type of book light will keep the light source directly over the book and won t wake up anyone else sleeping in the same room you can purchase clip on book lights at department stores bookstores or through online retailers most book lights require 1 or 2 aa batteries situate yourself under the covers with a flashlight to read undetected if you re trying to read quietly and unobtrusively e g without waking up your parents crawl down beneath the covers and pull the top of the blankets back over your head then switch on a flashlight and point it at your book the blankets will prevent light from leaking out so you can read comfortably for as long as you want 4 x research source this approach may be impractical for an adult trying to avoid waking their partner in the same bed your partner may find the rustling under the covers even more distracting than sleeping with the lights on avoid reading in the dark so you don t strain your eyes when reading at night you may find yourself sitting in a dark room straining and squinting to read the words on the page or screen this can exhaust and potentially damage your eyes to avoid straining your eyes reading at night sit or lie near a source of good lighting you could read by the light of a lamp or an overhead light if you need reading glasses wear them they will reduce the strain that causes your eyes to feel tired listen to an audiobook instead of reading instead of flipping through the pages of a hard copy book try loading up an e book on your tablet or smartphone that way you can put earphones in hide any light source and listen to a book in the dark without waking up any sleepers 5 x research source just try to avoid drifting off while the book is still playing or you may lose your place you can download audiobooks through the kindle amazon google or apple online stores many public libraries also have audio books either on cd or digitally sit up to read in bed to avoid falling asleep your mind probably associates reclining in your bed with sleeping which may cause you to fall asleep while you re reading if you find yourself in this situation do not read lying down at nighttime prop yourself up and sit comfortably in your bed while reading instead or read sitting or reclining on your sofa 6 x research source experiment with different sitting positions to see if any help you to stay awake while reading eat a light snack while you re reading a light snack will give you something to munch on while you re reading and can help you stay awake by giving your body a few late night calories look for a relatively healthy option so you re not just filling up on empty calories carbohydrates and processed foods 7 x research source try snacking on pretzels celery sticks blueberries or popcorn drink a cold decaffeinated beverage to keep yourself awake having a glass of ice water or lemonade will help you stay awake while you re reading at night slowly sip the drink while you re reading avoid caffeinated beverages like coffee iced tea

how to organise a gig,ever been to a local gig and had a good time well here s your chance to run your own gig make some cash and have fun all it takes is a little determination and some confidence organising a live music event isn t nearly as hard as you would think,talk to bands and organizers at local gigs and stay in contact with them 1 x research source offer to help on gigs that they are organizing e g offer to be a roadie and help set up equipment or put up the posters or sell tickets be sure to do it for free it will get you free access to the gig anyway and they will owe you a favour once you have been to a couple of gigs you should have met at least 5 bands or artists make sure you keep a good relationship with them find a venue for your gig local theatres cinemas schools and function rooms are open to be rented 2 x research source however once you find it talk to the manager to make sure it s within their rules to hold a live event your best bet is to use a theatre as many theatres have the option of holding a seated or standing gig and already have a pa system and stage installed this cuts costs there are also an increasing number of pubs dedicated to live music these are generally around 100 300 capacity and should also have sound engineers on their books and an in house pa this last point is vital if this is your first time putting on a gig having an in house pa not only cuts costs but means that a this is a venue where people come often enough to warrant an in house pa b the system should be set up to work with the room making your sound engineers job easier and c this will greatly reduce the amount of time and hassle before after the gig as there is one less thing for you to sort out and there will only be a minimal amount of gear going in coming out of the venue make sure you book your venue at least a month in advance of the gig but the more advance it is would be better so you can promote it better and get everything done before the gig get the cost of renting the venue for the night and add it to your budget sometimes venues want a cut of the ticket sales instead don t let them have more than 40 as that s already far too much if you have extra costs decide whether it is to be a seated or standing evening when it s a standing gig you can usually have a larger capacity and the public often prefer standing gigs as you can dance and mosh if it s a metal gig 3 x research source decide whether the gig will have assigned seats or general admission people usually prefer general admission because everyone has a shot at front row for the same price however a seated assigned seat gig requires less security and less hassle for you organize security theatres and venues often have door staff employed but you may need to pay extra for their services if this is a very localized gig with few people you may be able to get some of your larger more confident friends to do security at it however laws often require that you get professional security staff add this cost to your budget set an age limit if the venue has a bar decide whether it will be distributing alcohol or not if it is it must be an over age event alcohol being sold may increase your insurance costs 4 x research source get insurance public liability insurance pli may be included with the venue but always check 200 bucks for insurance for the night is better than a million dollar lawsuit all insurance companies have an option for pli but shop around for the best price also with each gig you organize as long as there are no accidents the cost of your insurance will go down because you have proved you re responsible and there is less risk add the cost of insurance to your budget determine which bands will be playing at the event you will need between three and six acts pick one band that has a large fan base and often headlines gigs about this size they will be your headliners and will ensure that you get a large enough crowd hopefully they will supply you with the drums for the night and some amps if they won t get one of the other bands to do this it s more effective and it s cheaper than renting instruments pick your other bands it s recommended that you get at least one band that is totally unheard of they can open the night and it will promote them as well as earn you one new contact calculate the costs of getting bands some bands may have a fee but often unsigned local bands will play for nothing if you throw in a few free tickets for their friends however don t take advantage of their generosity and always set aside some cold hard cash from the budget to give each band even if its only 40 or 50 quid a band they ll appreciate it throw in a few quid extra for whichever band supplied the drums etc just for wear and tear and as a thanks add this cost to your budget figure 5 x research source get a sound engineer if the venue has one and has a pa installed use him if not a sound engineer may supply a pa and set up the system for a cost if you are familiar with using a pa and miking amps etc feel free to organise this yourself but it is an added hassle maybe one of your friends new contacts can do this for free add any costs incurred to your budget get an mc this is the guy that introduces the bands and closes the night try to get someone locally famous on the band scene or do it yourself it just takes some confidence and a few minutes of preparation caution a rubbish drunk unpopular mc can ruin a night and cause unnecessary hassle better no mc than one that causes you problems put the most popular band on last and the least popular first 6 x research source give each starting band equal stage time the final two bands should get a little extra time tell the bands they prepare their set for extra 5 minutes longer or 5 minutes shorter than they actually have for example if they have a 30 minute set tell them to prepare a 25 minute set and also a 30 minute or longer set to keep everything running smoothly even if that goes out of control however be gentle and do not cut their performance while it is live such as cutting amplifier s power turning off volume etc secretly get your messages to the band behind the stage chances are that one edgy band keeps on playing and you should stay calm get a few security officers with you and finish their set after they finished the current song 7 x research source organising gear requirements gear sharing and sound check times is tricky constant communication is required there is no point in 5 bands bringing 5 drum kits and 5 sets of amps only for four of them sit outside in vans ready to be stolen generally it is the headlining acts job to supply a drum kit and the other drummers will have to provide what are known as breakables snare cymbals bass drum pedal however some drummers are not comfortable with this and will want other bands to use another kit if each band does use their own kit the gap between bands will go from 15 minutes to 25 and sound checks will be at least 5 minutes longer on a night with three bands not a problem 5 bands and an 11 o clock cut off you will have major night mares likewise with guitarists it is generally acceptable to use other people cabs the speakers under their amps but not the amps themselves unless the bands know each other and or are particularly laid back this gets tricky when headlining acts have combo amps or not enough cabs to go around then you have the added complication of a bands that isn t just drums bass gtr vocals keyboards acoustic guitars mandolins banjo s kazoos brass sections harps etc can bring on premature aging in a sound engineer if they are presented on the night with no prior warning start with the headlining act what will they bring what will they need what will they share tell the next band down what is available to them then ask them the same three questions by the time you get to the bottom couple of bands you should have all your shortages sorted there may be drum kits coming from one band cabs from others that only certain bands can use etc but as long as you have it all written down it should be fairly easy to keep track of from this you should be able to with the help of your sound engineer work out how long they need for sound checking if they all need a sound check and then organise times and let the bands know sounds like a lot of work and it is but it will save you from some big time stress on the night 8 x research source allow bands to sell cds and merchandise if possible during breaks and after the show don t charge them for doing this 9 x research source stay within the venue s time restraints 10 x research source generally leave 15 minutes between each band for setting up it is however a good idea to check this with the sound engineer as some bands may take more time to set up pack down depending on gear changes etc play music during the breaks music styles similar to the band on the nights but none of their music sound engineers will do this for you just tell them before hand so they bring the connection for your mp3 player make posters the budget but classy way to do this is to make one simple poster with white writing and a black background and get someone who works in an office to photocopy it as much as possible otherwise you will have an extra cost for printing put the following on the poster headlining band band on before them opening band location date cost any and all websites relating to bands venue tickets you etc put the posters up everywhere but always ask permission before putting them up put them up in music stores local youth hangouts internet cafes schools colleges if allowed and modern clothes shops ring your local newspaper radio station etc and tell them that the gig is on give them all the information you have on the poster or even post them a copy of the poster write a press release and send it to newspapers in your area and the area of the gig a few weeks before the gig try to get the newspaper to send a photographer if they have an out about section or similar encourage the bands to put the gig on their social media accounts such as facebook and instagram try to set up your own account dedicated to your organising gigs if you are really serious add together all your costs so far to get your budget divide this by the number of tickets you have available for sale not including ones you plan to give away for free this is the minimum amount you can charge per ticket to break even you may like to run your first gig as non profit to get people in your area interested in local gigs if you want to make a profit add on about 20 to this figure but always have a round ticket price it must be divisible by either 2 or 5 for example 11 is not ok but 12 or 10 is fine get the venue to print your tickets unless you re experienced in running gigs it is probably included in their fee anyway if they don t print tickets sell tickets on the door there will be no paper and or forged tickets involved this way use a hand stamp on people as they arrive get an original stamp but remember unless it s hand made someone else could have one so get an original colour ink pad to use and change the colour and stamp for every gig you run try to avoid assigning seats unless the venue absolutely insists first come first served is much more appealing to a young crowd and it will make sure everyone gets there on time for the first act make sure you get all the bands there early as no shows ruin the night a good two or three hours before the doors open would be good sound checking is a grey area make sure the headline band gets to the venue first as they will need to sound check first you then need to decide if every band can sound check talk to your sound engineer listen to what they say if you have 5 bands and two hours till your doors open there s no point in checking every 3 piece gtr bass drums rock band and still be sound checking when people walk in your first band should go on about half an hour after the doors open set up a green room the green room is simply a room backstage with some refreshments and should be big enough to hold the bands while they re not on stage be seen on the door and in the crowd asking people if they re having a good time check in with the sound engineer door staff and bands to make sure everything is running smoothly pay the bands and other staff promptly if the venue owners are good humoured have a mini party in the green room or go to a local pub or something to chat with the bands take any criticism and try to improve on what they tell you remember that most of these guys have been to a lot of gigs relax and get ready for your next successful

how to make fan art,fan art is a broad category of art that includes any visual artwork inspired by a work of fiction you like such as an anime a television show a novel series or a comic book making fan art is a great way to both show your love of a character or series and practice your drawing skills,gather your materials you ll need something to draw with and something to draw on paper and pencil is recommended if your pencil doesn t have an eraser on the end you ll need a separate eraser you ll also need a pen and either markers paint or colored pencils if you want to color your art alternatively you may want to use a computer to make digital art find a anime show or character that you like this will be the inspiration for your fan art if you can t find a show or character just find a person who inspires you greatly another option is to find any picture of a person or character to practice drawing from a source make a light sketch of your inspiration if it is an anime or character it doesn t have to be in a situation clothing etc that the original creator has positioned it in you can draw it in whatever position you like or want the character to be in 1 x research source for example if the series you ve taken your inspiration from is usually very serious in tone consider putting the character you ve chosen in a more lighthearted situation every good sketch is going to start by framing out the figure with basic shapes that indicate the proportions and locations of the body parts for example you can start with a single line to indicate the spine and then draw two ovals to position the torso 2 x research source take inspiration from but don t imitate the original style it s great to take ideas from the way the original artist portrayed them but add in some of your own style too examples of this include drawing the character with a more or less realistic face changes the proportions of the character making other objects such as a fashion range inspired by your character or adding details to his her outfit a common way to make your fan art a unique take on the original inspiration is to change the art style if you re taking inspiration from an anime try drawing the character in a more western cartoon style if you re taking inspiration from a live action show try drawing the character in a manga style flesh out the sketch take a step back and look at where your sketch could use improvement erase as necessary and keep sketching until you re happy with it add in all the details like pockets hair and facial features that were left out of the initial rough sketch 3 x research source 4 x research source how much detail you add will depend on the style you ve chosen to draw in a realistic drawing will require the most detail including detailed facial features folds and creases in clothing and anatomically correct muscle shapes a very cartoony drawing won t require much more than an simplified version of body anatomy and basic bold shapes for clothing and hair pay attention to what details about the inspiration you re drawing from stand out and define the character from the obvious things like hair color to the subtle things like the size of the eyebrows carrying these details over to your fan art is what will make your fan art recognizable as fan art and not an original character go over your sketch with pen once you have the final sketch trace it over with a pen going extra slowly and carefully to avoid mistakes this way you can erase all the un needed lines in the sketch add color or shade to the character you have finished tracing the most common coloring materials used are markers and colored pencils if you wish to keep it un colored it s best to shade it with a pencil the easiest way to start shading is to imagine a light source off in one corner or side of your drawing sides of objects and body parts opposite the light source will be the darkest and should be shaded appropriately options for coloring include colored pencils illustrating markers such as copic markers and digital coloring using a program like photoshop for photoshop you ll have to first scan your inked sketch and then open the scanned image in photoshop draw realistic style fan art to draw your fan art in a realistic style you ll have to learn human anatomy specifically how to draw the various muscle shapes on a figure and the proportions of each body part the best way to do this is to find a figure drawing anatomy book such as atlas of human anatomy for the artist by stephen rogers there are plenty of resources online that will help you learn how to draw realistic figures typically the process looks like this start with the frame of the body add in the basic body shapes detail the muscles of the body then add clothing last keep your lines light as you sketch so that when you go over your sketch in pen you can erase all the pencil easily 5 x research source draw manga style fan art manga style drawings are characterized by exaggerated proportions and facial features and simplified and stylized hair the main difference between manga and realistic figures will be in the face so if you re going from learning realistic figure drawing to manga drawing focus on how to draw manga faces manga faces typically have large highly detailed and shaded eyes with much simpler mouths and noses often manga noses and mouths will be drawn with two simple lines 6 x research source draw cartoon style fan art the great thing about drawing in a cartoon style is that you aren t restricted by realistic proportions or body shapes in fact the more exaggerated the better cartoon faces are more expressive than real faces and poses are more extreme typically cartoon heads are larger in relation to the body which helps with making expressive faces 7 x research source with cartoon sketches it s often not necessary to sketch out the whole body before adding the clothing just start with the simple body frame lines for the shoulders hips spine and appendages draw the basic shapes of the body and then start filling in the details like the clothes and hands 8 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment

your artwork better 1 x research source johannes vermeer s girl with a pearl earring draws attention to the small jewel in the ear of the subject 2 x research source consider what audiences need to know oftentimes titles help audiences understand what they re looking at titles can give tools to the audience to know how to interpret the piece what do you want audiences to know about your artwork 3 x research source do you want your title to direct the viewer towards a particular interpretation for example a work of art of a dog sitting on a beach can be interpreted in a number of ways but if you title the picture abandoned the viewer will assume that the dog has been abandoned on the beach if you title the picture best friend people will react differently to the dog s presence some artists prefer not to tell the meaning of their artwork deliberately leaving the title ambiguous make the title meaningful for yourself no matter your reasoning for choosing a particular title make it meaningful for you you are after all the artist and the artwork is made primarily for yourself some artists like to have titles that convey certain meanings so that they remember certain details about the process of making the artwork what inspired the artwork and so on frida kahlo titled one painting i belong to my owner during a tumultuous affair with exiled communist leo trotsky the painting of wild flowers in a vase symbolizes her overwhelming love for trotsky coupled with her need to remove herself from this affair 4 x research source look for inspiration in poems or quotes using parts of your favorite poem or quote can be an interesting and suitable title for your artwork similarly you could choose a passage from a book these should not however be too lengthy choose something that is a short phrase also choose something that adds to the artwork s meaning not something completely random that doesn t mean anything there shouldn t be copyright issues with this approach unless you are using a lengthy quote if you have just a few words from a poem or book and you are appropriating it in a new way this would likely be protected by fair use guidelines 5 x research source pam farrell titled her painting seasick sailor which were words that she heard in song by both beck and bob dylan david white used titles of books and movies such as the man who knew too much and the man who would be king and repurposed them into titles for a series of paintings one of his paintings is the man who was tired of perpetual war naming the action after the character in his painting 6 x

of art read the story behind why a particular artwork was given its name read titles for different types of artwork from classical paintings and modern drawings to sculptures and video art look for synonyms of words your title might revolve around a particular theme or topic but you might not like the word choices look up key words in a thesaurus to come up with alternate words that mean the same thing 9 x research source add descriptive words you might have a few key words that describe the theme you want to convey adding descriptive words can give more dimension to your title think of adjectives or adverbs that might work to enhance your title georgia o keeffe titled one painting calla lily turned away giving more description to the floral subject of her work mary cassatt named one painting mrs duffee seated on a striped sofa reading expanding on the most obvious subject to include more details of the painting try different combinations switch around the words that you ve chosen to see how they flow together putting the words in a different order can shift the meaning slightly or it can make it easier to say say the words out loud to hear how they sound together choose a purely descriptive title instead of delving into a complex naming process consider giving your artwork a very simple title that describes exactly what is in the artwork this could be something like wooden table with fruit bowl red ball or girl swinging emily carr titled many of her paintings simply such as breton church and big raven 10 x research source claude monet s still life apples and grapes is a still life painting of a table with fruit 11 x research source translate a title into another language key words that reflect the topic or theme of your artwork might resonate better in another language choose a few words and try them in another language make sure you spell the words right in the other language double check any accents or other required markings for your words missing these markings can potentially mean altering the entire meaning of a given word try to find someone who speaks that language run your title by them to make sure it doesn t carry unwanted connotations see if there are other works of art with the same name the goal with titling your artwork is to make sure it stands apart from other works of art if it has the same name as another piece of artwork especially something well known that can unintentionally link your art to someone else s risking confusion misinterpretation or just basic lack of originality search online for your title and see what you find ask others for their impression of your title your title might mean one thing to you but something entirely different to another person getting first reactions and feedback on your title can be a good way to understand how it will be received consider if your title is ambiguous or if it can be interpreted in different ways check your spelling unless it s deliberate don t send your artwork out into the world with any misspelled word in the title your error can make you look less professional or serious as an artist similarly double check grammar especially if your title is longer than a phrase 12 x research source make the title work for you while you might title a piece of art to give it additional meaning you may also title a piece of art so that you can promote yourself as an artist forgo the untitled title and instead strive to have a distinguishable work of art this can potentially even add value to your artwork 13 x research source for paintings in a series you might name them sequentially such as blue fence 1 blue fence 2 and so on they may be hard to keep track of however go for different titles and help yourself keep track of individual works reviewers critics and collectors can reference your work more accurately with a specific title if you call all your pieces untitled it will quickly get confusing as to which piece is being referred to having a unique title will make it easier for people searching online for your work to find you 14 x research source make sure the title accompanies your artwork if you plan to circulate your artwork at all make sure the title of the piece goes with the artwork write it on the back of the actual piece of art 15 x research source if you post your artwork online make sure your title appears with the artwork this can improve your online profile by making your artwork easier to find,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to read a novel,enjoying novels is not always easy reading requires you to put effort into the novel otherwise you end up lost bored and confused the best novels however always reward you for the effort showing off a depth and power that you might have missed while skimming though reading a novel takes work it is enjoyable low stress work with a little practice reading even difficult books will become second nature,block out distractions while you re reading the best novels allow you to sink into them becoming engrossed in the world of the novel while the outside world drops away giving your full attention to a book is the best way to read and understand it whether you re reading novels or textbooks novels however are often told in a unique way meaning you need time to get accustomed to the speaker the style and the world of the story to fully grasp them in general avoid music with lyrics in it while you re reading try to read in blocks setting aside at least 30 minutes it is very hard to keep track of things if you re constantly picking the book up and down remove yourself from outside distractions like a tv or lots of human activity nail down the basic questions of the novel before tackling the headier themes while some of this may seem obvious taking five minutes to answer the following questions will give you a great foundation to keep reading these are the essential parts of the novel and you need to grasp them before moving on to more difficult discussions what does the main character s want who is telling the story where and when is the story set be specific if you re struggling to get the basics there is no harm in picking up a study guide or reading a plot summary on wikipedia this can help you grasp the basic concepts quickly and start looking for nuance think about the narrator s role in the story if they have one novels are fictional meaning that except perhaps in the foreword the narrator is also fictitious is the narrator a part of the story or are they separate from it do they know everything or just what certain character s know most importantly can you trust the narrator one of the biggest struggles for many readers is that they trust the narrator too much then when they contradict themselves or make a mistake it feels like the author made a mistake or that you don t understand the book however unreliable narrators are great clues into the meanings of a book after all no real human could ever be a perfect narrator in general you should be cautious of any narrator who seems drunk high or otherwise drugged a clockwork orange is mentally or socially impaired the sound and the fury curious incident of the dog at nighttime has reasons to lie often because of a crime or wrongdoing lolita 1 x research source think about the style why is a novel being told the way it is is it written in letters or journal entries or normal narration does the author use big intimidating words or straightforward concise sentences if you re confused think for a moment about how the story is being told it often tells you something about what is being told do you have distance between the events does the narrator seem to know what is going to happen or are you along for the ride together summarize the main events of each chapter or part once you finish it take a moment to stop and reflect on the events in each chapter what exactly changed from the beginning of the section to the end have characters grown has the plot thickened are you back where you started eventually after you ve finished 4 5 chapters you ll notice that these little summaries form an outline of the novel try and mark how characters change once you know how a character has changed throughout a chapter you can start to figure out why they ve changed if it is not already try and order the plot chronologically stories that are presented out of order like the iliad or absalom absalom are often difficult because they are jumbled up not because the actual plot is complicated 2 x research source read with a partner or group it is impossible to digest all of the complex thoughts themes and symbols in a novel all by yourself especially if you re reading it once books should be shared and discussed so try and convince someone else to read the book along with you have discussions at certain points in the book then talk about it when you ve both finished between the two or three or more of you this is often the best way to break down a complex novel without re reading it search for symmetry coincidence and common motifs novels are carefully constructed and by noting the similarities between characters chapters and settings you can get a clue into the overall structure of the book just as important are moments that should be similar but have changed for some reason such as a character coming back home after a long time away what things keep popping up in the book why do you think they re important in the orphan master s son the idea of movies actors and hollywood shows up repeatedly in the protagonist s early life this is crucial but not until the last third of the book in the great gatsby there is repeated mention of a blinking light off the coast and blinking lights reappear several other times all of these moments are linked by longing for something the character s cannot have reconsider the beginning of the novel once you ve finished to truly understand and appreciate a novel you need to consider the entire thing moments that fell flat or didn t make sense early on might gain new meaning by the end of the book sometimes the last few pages can complete turn the meaning plot or theme of the book around like in fight club or atonement once you ve finished a book skim over your notes or the first chapter again do you get a new appreciation for the book what would you call the theme of the book what ultimately is the book about form your own opinion on the book but back it up with facts ultimately once a book is published it is up for a reader to make their own meaning out of it to get the most out of the book and or your papers you need to inject your own personality into the reading do you agree with the themes do you think the author effectively made you sympathize with the characters or did you hate them you can have any opinion you want but you need to back it up with evidence from the book quotes summaries and your notes will form the basis of your case whether arguing with a friend or writing a term paper you should always turn to novel for evidence take notes especially of passages you like or find confusing it is absolutely essential to take good notes when reading a novel for class it is doubly important if you need to write an essay on the book later you should highlight or underline important passages and provide a brief note to the side reminding you why it is important symbolism character shift repeated metaphor etc on paper you should note bigger moments and shifts keeping track of character changes overarching themes and passages or moments you don t quite understand yet take notes during class discussion marking important pages and quotes that you may have missed you can go overboard with notes you want your notes to be a guideline for your writing when you finish the book if the whole book is underlined you won t get a lot of useful information apply common literary terms to your analysis knowing literary vocabulary is the best way to get your point across when writing or talking about a book it also helps you understand the novel as you re reading giving a name to the myriad techniques and moments that you encounter so that you can take better notes theme the overarching ideas morals or thoughts of the novel can be as simple as good beats evil and as complex as capitalism is destroying the modern family metaphor making two dissimilar things seem similar she is a rose doesn t literally mean the woman is a flower it means she is beautiful delicate and a little barbed a simile is when the metaphor uses the words like or as ie she is like a rose she is pretty as a rose motif a repeated idea image or flavor in a book if a book frequently uses sailing and ocean metaphors for example it could be said to have a nautical motif allusion a reference to another work either directly or indirectly for example any character that dies and is raised from the dead a tale of two cities harry potter is frequently considered a biblical allusion to jesus christ symbolism when an object in the book stands for the idea of something else symbolism is everywhere sometimes unintentionally because humans think in terms of symbols for example in of mice and men the rabbit farm comes to symbolize lenny s dreams of financial security and safety a symbol comes to represent a much larger idea than it initially appears 3 x research source examine the style of the book and find relationships to other books how exactly is the story told is there humor or is it mostly serious are the sentences long and difficult or short and speedy you need to move past the basics of what happened and onto why it happened do you think the author was influenced by other writers artists or current events if so how do they use fiction to really explore those influences there are no right answers to these questions but you need to ask them to get the most out of the novel you cannot only worry about plot when reading as plot is just one of the many pieces that make up a novel some teachers encourage reading summaries before starting the book this helps you pay more attention to characters themes and structure since you know how the plot ends up find the common bonds between function and form novels work on two levels the first level is function and it concerns what the novel is trying to say plot theme setting etc the second part form is how it is being said perspective structure metaphor etc while good readers will note each side excellent readers will note how the two of them come together how does form reinforce function david foster wallace s infinite jest is all about the nature of entertainment debating in part if one must work for entertainment accordingly half the novel is written in footnotes making the reader work by flipping back and forth even within sentences and other footnotes even less serious books must merge form and function to be successful dracula tells its horrible story as a series of letters and first hand documents instead of a narrator this allows bram stoker to slowly ratchet up the horror and gives the reader a sense that this really happened somewhere in england 4 x research source consult outside sources from non fiction research to critical essays as long as you cite the findings of other authors one of the best ways to expand your knowledge of a book is to read into the world around it you could research historical background information or the author s own life and inspiration you could read critical essays which are common for classic books and can help make sense of complex novels when writing longer papers reading the thoughts of other writers is a great way to form your arguments early on do you agree and have other evidence to offer do you disagree and can you use the book to prove them wrong always cite any outside sources you ve read and expand on them with your personal opinions use these sources as a jumping off point not your only argument 5 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to make a mixtape,a mixtape is a curated collection of music from a variety of different sources that has been hand picked and copied onto some form of audio recording media usually to give to someone as a personalized gift mixtapes were traditionally cassette tape but now cds or even flash drives filled with mp3 files can serve the same function 1 x research source mixtapes are often but not always built around a theme and are a fun way to share music with those you care about follow the steps below to make your own perfect mixtape for any occasion,consider your theme sometimes a mixtape will just be some of your favorite songs but a really impressive mixtape has a theme and conveys a message think carefully about the person you are making the tape for and what you hope to express to them 2 x research source think creatively different types of mixtape call for different stylistic approaches a few of these are covered in greater detail below choose a nice mix a great mixtape may have some familiar songs and some songs that will be new to the recipient choose songs you like and think your loved one will like but don t be afraid to push their boundaries a little 3 x research source be selective less is more don t just dump all your favorite songs onto your mixtape unless you are just trying to share some music if you want to send a message be spare with your selections use only what you need to say what you want and no more order your songs carefully putting tracks in the perfect order is part of the art of the mixtape consider the narrative tonal emotional and musical arc of the mixtape craft your songs into a story 4 x research source add a name all but the most mundane mixtapes will benefit from having a name at the very least a descriptive name will help the recipient keep track of what s on the tape for example 2010s folk music if it s special make it sound special for more tightly themed mixtapes there is an art to coming up with the perfect name using the name of the person who will receive the mixtape can be very flattering to them a name can also be used as part of a statement addressed directly to the recipient using a favorite lyric from one of the songs on the tape is a good way to center every song on the tape around that lyric and encourage the recipient to think about the tape in that context a name that succinctly reflects the theme can help make sense of the song order you choose for the tape a mixtape named dawn to dusk for instance suggests a very specific arc of music add art this doesn t necessarily mean a tiny painting or a sketch although those are fine it means any kind of cassette decoration you can put some effort into to create a finished product that s unique and unmistakable color it in colored markers are a time honored tool of the cassette decorator s trade they can brightly decorate any paper surface with minimal trouble try an abstract pattern or oversized multicolored lettering even a plain black marker can cloak a cassette case insert in zebra stripes or dense spirals make it sparkle sequins and glitter add flash with just a bit of thin glue and a paintbrush be careful not to get anything on the actual tape inside the cassette and avoid putting anything that isn t flat like a rhinestone on the cassette or cd itself or the recipient may have trouble getting it to play save such decorations for the outside of the case replace the labels with a bit of planning and some care the cassette or cd case insert and even the tape label itself can be custom made from scratch use cloth top medical tape for a nice wide label that takes marker very well carefully cut out a photograph or part of a magazine article and firmly glue it onto the tape with proper holes cut out of it for the tape reels to make a completely new label use the case insert as a backing board for a collage screw around with the content of the tape if you re an experienced and confident mixtape creator take your tape to the next level by filling in every possible gap between the songs to create a continuous sonic experience give your mixtape a background track this takes some finesse and causes sound quality to suffer a bit but the result is worth the trouble get a long recording of something that isn t quite music such as a poetry recital a comedy routine or a soundtrack of old tv commercials and record it onto both sides of your tape first carefully plan your songs out you won t get any second chances to re record them without messing up the tape record your mixtape over the previous recording leaving gaps of a few seconds each between songs the gaps in your mixtape will be filled with the previous recording for an interesting and attention grabbing effect paint a sonic landscape with filler tracks scrape together all the short songs less than a minute you can find and use them to fill in the gaps at the end of each side of the tape they ll serve as bookends framing the rest of the mix in a different light for an even more ambitious project include any sound bites you can find in larger songs that are only a couple of seconds long and manually record one of them between each of your regular songs as you make the tape select your medium cd flash drive or digital transfer these days most of us listen to music on computers and digital media players but you can still curate your favorite music into a compelling mix to share with someone special the best ways are burning a cd putting your music onto a small flash drive or simply sending your tape over the internet 5 x research source read more on how to burn a mix cd organize your songs into a playlist and add digital album art then burn your cd 6 x research source decorate your cd and cd case give your cd case an eye catching cover and include the track listing on the back 7 x research source read more on how to put your mix on a usb flash drive gather the files into a folder on your computer rename each one with a number in front of the title to put them in the proper order include a txt or doc file with any track information you wish to add as well as your cover art drag the folder into your flash drive s icon on your computer 8 x research source since flash drives are usually small consider putting yours in an envelope or taping it to a card before handing it off this way you can include some physical decorations or a handwritten note and make it harder to lose read more on how to send your mix over the internet gather your mix into a folder and include track listing documentation and album art perhaps compress the folder into a zip file 9 x research source use your preferred method to send your file to your mix s recipient get your equipment making a traditional cassette mixtape requires a few special pieces of gear a blank cassette tape a cassette recorder a collection of recorded music such as lps or cds and a cord to connect the tape recorder to your music player 10 x research source choose your length there are a few different lengths of blank cassette tape commonly available the best lengths for making a mixtape are 60 minutes 30 on each side or 90 minutes 45 on each side avoid 120 minute cassettes as their sound quality is considerably lower organize your music once you ve settled on a track list list get some ideas below stack your recorded music so that you can work your way through the stack from top to bottom as you make the mixtape this will help keep you from losing track of the project as you record if you are able to get lengths for each track do so this will help you organize your songs around the break that comes halfway through the tape move songs off your computer if your music collection is primarily digital but you would still like to make an old fashioned cassette mixtape all is not lost burn the songs you want to use onto blank cds using your computer s optical recording drive and then record to the tape from the cds be sure that you burn a music disc and not a data disc since data discs won t work with every kind of stereo alternatively if you have a way to run your mp3 player s audio through your stereo you can record directly from it onto the tape be aware that sound quality will typically take a hit if you use this method compared to the cd method connect your cassette recorder to your cd player record player or other cassette player there are cords that should be able to do this for most cassette players if you can use an integrated setup most stereo and hi fi systems manufactured over the last few decades have a cassette recorder built into one of their integrated tape decks look for the tape deck with an extra button which usually has a red dot on it put the blank cassette into the recorder deck and push play let the tape play for a few seconds until the sound changes to a smooth hiss and then stop it set up your music put the first album you are copying a song from into the appropriate player on the stereo or hi fi for cds pause the playback and skip tracks until you reach the track you want for other cassettes fast forward to the song and then stop or pause the tape for lps leave the dust cover up and wait for a moment record a song push the record button on the recorder deck this will push the play button down automatically as well and then start playing the song you picked pushing record first ensures that none of the song gets clipped off at the start if you re recording from an lp drop the needle just before the song you want to record and once the record reaches the silent space between tracks push record on the tape deck stop recording and load the next song stay close to the stereo and push the stop button on the recorded deck as soon as your song is finished this will stop the recording you can then stop the first album and switch it out for the next song on your mixtape list fill up both sides when your cassette reaches the end of the first side it s time to flip it over and continue on the back check your mixtape listen to your mixtape through to make sure everything recorded correctly if a song didn t come out right record of that part of the tape until you are satisfied unless you carefully budgeted your time it s likely that you ll end up with part of a song at the end of the first side you can erase songs from your mixtape by recording over them while no music is playing write down or print out the track listing on a card and slip it into the cassette cover consider adding cover art decorations and other finishing touches think of a specific reason just because is a fine excuse to make a mixtape but you made me smile yesterday and i can t figure out how you did it is better your reason will suggest themes which can be adopted to make the mixtape more cohesive settle on a theme it doesn t necessarily have to be connected to your reason for making the mixtape but you should choose something you think your boyfriend or girlfriend will appreciate using the example above you might come up with a theme of songs that mention smiling search for songs that fit your theme feel free to use novel or unorthodox interpretations of your theme to help you find more songs get as many songs together as you can and listen to all of them or at least parts of all of them keep trying until you get it right if you just can t seem to scrape together enough music to fill a blank tape try to come up with a different theme instead narrow the playing field think about what your significant other likes what you like and how you want the theme to be expressed think about whether or not you can create a deeper message out of your songs by putting them in a certain order with a little luck you ll be able to whittle down your selections to just about the right amount to fit onto a mixtape spend a lot of time on the order of your songs order is important for this type of themed mixtape a good song order allows the songs to flow from one to the next in a way that makes sense and adds meaning working all this extra detail into your mixtape is also a great way to show your significant other how much love you ve poured into making it for them hear with the recipient s ears very often when you make a mixtape for a parent or other older relative it is intended to be a way for them to sample new music if you re going to show them a lot of new music spend some time trying to guess whether or not they ll actually enjoy listening to any of it first remember this person has very different musical tastes than you do pick your tracks based on what you think they will like for this kind of mixtape pick the catchiest and most accessible songs you can think of within the confines of whatever type of music you re planning to give away use your past as a guide if you can t figure out which tracks those might be think back to the first time you heard the albums in question what tracks immediately caught your attention even if you ve moved on from them now those are the tracks most likely to make a good impression on people who haven t heard the music before keep other people in mind assuming that you are bringing your tape to work with the intention of playing it over the speakers so you can listen to it while you do your job the most important consideration aside from picking songs you like is the wants and preferences of the other people who will hear the tape think of the children if you work in a customer environment where children and families might be present you should avoid songs with swearing or adult themes like violence and drug use be a team player try to pick songs you think your coworkers will enjoy rather than just whichever tracks you feel like listening to at the moment use a simple theme deeper themes require a flow not just from song to song but across different styles and sounds of music which won t translate well in most workplaces instead pick a plain and simple theme like songs about days of the week or blues songs that sound like summer afternoons that way when your coworkers hear the first song they ll know what to expect from the rest of the tape and be able to get back to focusing on work consider donating your tape to work if it s a big hit with your coworkers think about leaving it there permanently for anyone to use whenever they feel like hearing it the point of making a mixtape generally speaking is to give it to someone else anyway so just think of it as a natural next step

how to improve your art skills,improving your art skills takes passion and dedication whether you want to be a professional artist or just get really good at a new hobby you can create thoughtful highly skilled art with a little patience and lots of practice you ll need to develop a daily routine to practice and have an open mind about taking on new skills and experimenting with old ones training your eyes to see the world like an artist will also help you create realistic pieces or work with light shadows and composition in a novel creative way art is supposed to be unique so have fun and don t shy away from breaking the rules,watch free online tutorials to learn techniques like blending or shading if you want to learn how to make particular colors or create realistic looking shading and shadows consider watching some free online tutorials have your sketchpad and supplies handy so you can pause the video and practice as the instructor breaks it down 1 x research source peruse the comment section on videos because it s likely that other artists have left some tips and suggestions search for tutorials in any particular technique you want to learn for instance you might find some good lessons on composition working with light cubism surrealism or even creating 3 d effects if you can think of it the internet probably has it take private lessons or join an art class focused on particular skills if you re a beginner look to local community centers and libraries for beginning art courses if you already have some intermediate or advanced skills you might consider enrolling in a class offered at a local college or art institute 2 x research source taking classes is a great way to meet other artists and get some constructive criticism to find local instructors classes and workshops near you go to https artcantina com use instruction books if you re a beginner or learning a specific skill workbooks are a great way to start if you re a beginner or looking to pick up a very specific skill like figure drawing or cartooning this is a great option if you have a busy schedule because you can tackle each lesson at your own pace 3 x research source you can buy instruction books online or at most large bookstores if you rent an instruction book from your local library don t draw in the book photocopy the practice pages so you can draw on those instead if you re a beginner look for instruction books that have traceable practice sheets so you can get a feel for it before practicing on a canvas or sketchpad beware of the paint or draw by number format it can help if you re an absolute beginner but it may also hinder your individual style great artists are unique connect with other artists online for tips about styles and materials if you want to learn to draw or paint particular things like people animals and landscapes or work with certain materials like oil paints watercolor and charcoal join an online artist community peruse the forums for any particular style or material and don t be afraid to ask for advice 4 x research source deviant art artist daily and wetcanvas are great online communities with thousands of artists to connect with and learn from for example you might visit a new artist thread and post something like i m trying to learn different techniques for blending oil paints i m also not sure what kind of brushes are best for my geometric style any tips or advice assess your weaknesses and work on them take some time to think about which techniques you re really good at and which ones you can improve upon rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 10 for each of the following skills realism life drawing portraits imaginative or memory drawing proportions composition human anatomy color blending or theory and shading then put extra effort into working things that you ve rated on the lower end of the scale 5 x research source for example if you re great at drawing geometric shapes but struggle with shading spend more time practicing different shading techniques set a realistic goal for improving on particularly weak skills for instance you might say i m going to devote at least 40 minutes of each sketching session to practicing shading faces practice your art every day and set goals for yourself schedule time to practice every day even if all you have is 20 minutes to spare practicing every day is essential to learning and mastering new techniques if you re a beginner make an effort to practice for at least 30 minutes each day and gradually work your way up until you re practicing for an hour or longer 6 x research source after dinner or before going to bed are good times to practice because it will help you unwind from the day keep a calendar and x off each day that you practice your art try to rack up as many days in a row as you can to form a good habit set daily or weekly goals for your art practice for example you might say i m going to finish 1 charcoal sketch per week use a wooden human mannequin to practice drawing anatomy set up a wooden mannequin in any position you like in order to practice drawing the body this is particularly helpful to learn proper proportions 7 x research source you can buy a wooden mannequin online or at any art supply store reference a photograph to practice making realistic art use a photograph you took or clip one from a magazine set it up near your work area and try to emulate it as best you can or you can incorporate some elements of the photograph like color the color scheme and composition and let those things inform your own artistic creation 8 x research source set up your own still life scene to draw or paint search your home for interesting objects you d like to paint or draw then arrange those things in an interesting way in front of any backdrop you like for instance you might place a vase candle and bowl of fruit onto a table in front of a checkered wall 9 x research source when setting up a model play with the composition by moving pieces around before you start working consider making interesting shadows by rearranging larger or taller items in reference to the light source for instance you might create an interesting shadow across a bowl by placing a tall candle between the bowl and the light source in the room ask a friend or family member to be your model if you want to practice life drawing or portraiture consider asking someone you know to sit for you while you sketch or paint them just make sure they re okay with sitting still for however long it takes you to do it 10 x research source if you re using a live model keep lighting in mind you might want to use a small desk lamp to light them from the side to create interesting shadows invest in quality art supplies better paints tools and other materials will often perform better and last longer putting money into your art will also make it more likely that you ll take it seriously and keep practicing don t swear off cheaper materials altogether just try to work with the best quality materials for what you re trying to do 11 x research source experiment with various brands of the same media at different price ranges open stock supplies like paints pencils and markers are often less expensive than ready made kits get out of the children s art supply section those brands typically don t have the same properties as the more professional or artist versions break out of your comfort zone by trying new mediums and styles try out different mediums and styles to expand your overall skill set for example if you typically use pencils and colored pencils to create classical art try using pastels for a new perspective or if you re comfortable drawing anime try practicing surrealist art or cubist styles 12 x research source if you re okay with spending some extra money try using a pen tablet to take your art to a new digital level learning different mediums will also help you create unique mixed media pieces get inspired by your favorite artists look at the work of some of your favorite artists and consider learning how they did particular techniques for instance if you want to learn how to use shapes in an interesting way you might study picasso s guernica and try to emulate a similar sense of urgency through the geometry of your work 13 x research source as another example if you want to get better at blending colors you might focus on emulating a particular section of one of van gogh s works then use that skill and apply it towards your own work go to local art galleries and museums to get inspiration and when you do go read the artist s notes and statements next to the pieces to see what materials they used if the artist is present ask them about their techniques don t be afraid to experiment and break some rules some of the greatest artists hold strong opinions and unique viewpoints so feel free to rebel against artistic norms think of how picasso rebelled against traditional modes of perspective or how edgar degas rejected classical methods of composition like picasso said learn the rules like a pro so you can break them like an artist 14 x research source art is all about making mistakes and working with them so if you experiment and don t like the result find a way to make something new out of it take time to express curiosity in your surroundings study the color shape texture and size of random things you encounter throughout your day look at the face of the person you re talking to notice how light affects the shadows and the shape of their features pay special attention to how light looks on certain textures like clothing and skin 15 x research source noticing these things will help you gain a better understanding of how real objects look with different types of light hitting them as a fun exercise try to describe objects without using their names to help you visualize and capture shapes for example if you re looking at a tree you might describe the trunk as a sloping cylinder and the leaves as tiny lemon shapes identify variations in color so you can accurately recreate them when you re looking at something notice any color variations and how that causes your eyes to want to linger or move to another area note the subtle hues within a certain color like all the different shades of red on an apple 16 x research source for instance if you re looking at a brightly colored tulip note how the hot pink petals contrast with the soft green hue of the stem and how your eyes are drawn to the lighter tips of the petals squint at objects to see their composition of shape and color take time to squint your eyes at a particular thing landscape or scene squinting minimizes your eyes ability to see color and detail and blurs the

also help you distinguish between shadows and light use negative space to create balance or tension when you re looking at a particular object or scene notice the background space like a wall table or backdrop allowing negative space in your paintings will give it a sense of balance or tension depending on the scene and overall esthetic 18 x research source for example take note of the colors shadows and textures of objects behind the central objects you d like to paint for instance a burnt orange wall with a diagonal shadow can make the candles and flowers in the foreground stand out more study the composition of a particular scene or object notice how certain objects are put together to create shapes or lines the geometry of a particular scene or collection of objects draws the spectator s in a particular pattern 19 x research source for example imagine a still scene of a bookstore the aisle on the left creates a line that moves the eye vertically a string twinkle lights between shelves might move the eye across the top and another shelf encourages the eye to move up or down the vertical eye movements on each side of the painting might act as a sort of frame for the

how to prepare for and enjoy an amusement park,many people love amusement parks but they don t prepare themselves properly read this article to help save your money and improve overall enjoyment of your trip to the amusement park,research have you gone to this park before if not research beforehand if there doesn t seem to be any attractions that you like don t force yourself plan your trip and invite friends make sure you know how much tickets cost and buy them beforehand if necessary if you are sure that you want to go multiple times see if a season pass is worth the money there are sometimes passes that are used up once you go on a certain number of rides if you only want to ride a few opt for these but if not make sure you are buying a pass that will let you ride all day stay on site if appropriate or nearby if you re making a multi day vacation of it which is a good idea if you want to hit up the amusement park staying on site or nearby will make it all much easier have a plan while it may seem tempting riding rides in whatever order you feel like can mean you travel from one end of the park to the other many more times than is necessary and your feet will be very sore as a result to avoid this get a park map and use it ride things in order or at least ride everything you want to go on in one specific area of the park before moving on to another have enough money on hand depending on how long you will be at the park make plans for what you will eat keep in mind that park food is expensive have pills with you if you think you ll need them if you have nausea but otherwise enjoy park rides there should be nausea relieving pills at your local drugstore or pharmacy take these beforehand unless you re sure that you won t be nauseous it s best to have these with you consider your attire dress lightly but take a jacket if you need to and take only what you need if you take your own food check the park permits this and make sure your amusement park offers storage first try to check the weather report for the area you re going visit dress accordingly for the weather try to avoid wearing dark colored clothes such as black or dark grey if it is during summer wearing these colors could make you warmer and you may start sweating also if you re going on the water rides have a swimsuit on underneath your clothes wear good shoes flip flops aren t really the best idea for an amusement park especially rides that leave your feet dangling wear supportive sneakers or walking shoes don t wear loose clothing if you want to wear a hat always remember to put it in a secure pocket before going on a ride keep your wallet or purse secure they can be easily lost in the hustle and bustle of an amusement park tie up long hair hair past shoulder length can easily get tangled on a windy ride braids are recommended as they stay closer to the head and don t have loose hair like ponytails don t wear earrings many coasters can be rough and you don t want holes poked into the back of your head some earrings may get stuck in your hair or attire however if you really want to wear earrings wear non dangling ones such as studs or pearls take plenty of sunscreen especially in the summertime most of the ride lines will subject you to the elements whatever they are take a water bottle it s easy to get dehydrated out in the sun all day don t take a ton of stuff unless you re visiting with someone who won t be riding most of the rides don t take huge bags or purses with you if you can help it you won t be able to take these on most of the rides you ll either have to leave them with a non rider pay for a locker or stuff them into bins before getting onto a ride this last option offers no guarantee that someone won t walk off with your brand new coach purse while you re on a coaster wear something with big pockets that either zipper or button closed all you really need is some cash and maybe your phone you can always leave a jacket in your car and go get it later always take medication with you or take it beforehand who knows you might need it go on a weekday if possible avoid weekends at any park during the summer months once school is out places like cedar point are packed especially on the weekends arrive early if you want to catch the shortest ride wait times and escape the heat of the day get to the park as early as possible and people do arrive earlier so they can dash to their favorite rides as soon as possible pace yourself take a break from the coasters every once in a while perhaps throwing in a train or gondola ride these can also serve as great ways of getting around the park that don t wear out your sneakers don t force people to go on a ride don t force yourself or a friend to go on a certain ride especially if you or your friend does not fit the criteria for the ride if you are too short weigh too much have medical conditions or are pregnant be careful about what rides you decide to go on if you want to play games and buy souvenirs wait until you and whoever is with you have had enough of the other attractions by leaving it to the end you won t have to be restricted by the giant stuffed animal you re carrying around,Arts-and-Entertainment

webpages youtube facebook website etc that you have and basic information about your music genre themes etc write a short biography this should be a short description of you or your band if you have one and your accomplishments so far you can talk about your influences and interests here but keep this part story oriented consider it like your introduction to a new friend 5 x research source create a fact sheet this should include the essential information about you name style of music other artists bands you are similar to instrumentation etc determine your radio options the genre of music you play will help to determine the radio stations that are likely to play your song for example public radio stations such as local national public radio affiliates tend to focus on indie jazz and singer songwriter types 6 x research source your local college radio station may be a good choice for music that draws a younger audience such as rap hip hop and rock 7 x research source make sure you send your song to a station that s shown they play that type of music research your local stations you re probably going to need to start small especially if you haven t signed with a record label

concerns than commercial radio so they might be more willing to take a chance on your song 8 x research source however commercial radio stations may also be interested in your music especially if you re a local act so check out the websites for the stations in your area you can find radio station locators on the internet these will allow you to search by state city or country 9 x research source

musicians who are new on the scene pandora allows direct submissions 11 x research source amazingradio com is another online station that accepts independent and emerging artists 12 x research source live365 com will host your music in their music library which will allow their online stations access to it make connections many djs and radio stations have social media accounts now follow them on twitter and facebook and check out their blogs and playlists you ll have a better chance of personalizing your submission if you know who you re sending your song to you can also reach out to radio stations and djs through social media a tweet to them about your music will get your name out there without seeming overly aggressive read guidelines carefully submission guidelines vary widely depending on where you re submitting your music in general though music on cd seems to be the preferred submission method few places will accept a digital file sent as an email attachment if the radio station s website provides specific guidelines follow them nothing will turn off staff faster than you not following their directions many stations will discard music without listening to it if it isn t submitted properly if you can t find information about submitting your music online contact the station with your inquiry directly send a short friendly email explaining who you are your musical experiences and what your song is about if you have a youtube facebook or other media page include a link don t send any attachments many places won t open email attachments because of security and virus concerns customize your submissions a personalized submission is far more likely to catch a music director or dj s eye than a form email that s clearly been sent to 500 other stations this also goes for physical cd submissions whenever possible customize your submission using people s names if you can find them and a brief statement of why you fit in with their station s feel send in your music once you ve established the guidelines for submitting your music send it in give complete information your contact info and the cd s track listing are essential but don t send anything that isn t asked for wait it can take days weeks or even months for your song to make it into the hands of a music director especially if you ve sent it to a larger station don t harass people with calls or emails remember they get many submissions from hopeful artists just like you and it takes awhile to listen to everything the radio station may give a time frame for responding to you if it s past that time frame a friendly email inquiry is appropriate but try not to sound accusative or angry a simple email asking if the music director has had time to listen to your submission yet will suffice prepare for rejection it s always awesome when an artist gets a big break but there are many artists and bands out there and only so much radio space you may be rejected from the first several stations you contact and that s okay be persistent and patient being rejected doesn t mean your music is bad,Arts-and-Entertainment

opinionated articles rather than strictly factual news such as the opinion section in the detroit free press which may offer editorial perspectives on universal healthcare or the war on terror 2 x research source the lifestyle section usually has stories about the arts and commerce forbes for example may have articles about new movies popular car models and travel ideas 3 x research source the entertainment section includes movie and theater reviews as well as interviews with authors and artists and information about art galleries and other local and national events similarly the sports section will report box scores from sports currently in season and may include personal stories about players coaches or issues in the athletic world such as the concussion problem in the nfl 4 x research source fold your paper so that you can read easily and comfortably if you re in a crowded space like a train fold your newspapers into quadrants for easier reading and less worry about bothering other people 5 x research source you might find it easier to separate the various sections usually marked by a letter and deal with them one at a time rather than trying to keep all of the pages in order folding a newspaper correctly is optional although if you re passing it on to another person it s courteous to put all of the sections back in place when you re done preview the section you ve chosen to read newspaper articles are usually written in an inverted pyramid structure which means that the most significant information appears at the start of the story rather than the end followed by the details in order of importance the first sentence called the lead or lede is designed to catch readers attention and provide the major details of the story to entice them to read further 6 x research source sidebars near significant stories offer analysis for understanding the why of the story read them first to have some context for the ideas 7 x research source you can also read the articles subheadings or callout quotes if available for an overview of major topics and notable comments in the story choose the article that you want to read and begin read the first few paragraphs as these will contain the primary points of the article and you ll be able to determine if you want to continue reading it read the rest of the article or move to a new one if you ve lost interest or if it doesn t provide any information that you find worthwhile don t be afraid to jump to a new article or section if your purpose is satisfied or if you need a break from a difficult topic for example you may find reading too much about domestic violence is too distressing for a relaxing read so you can decide to save an article about an upcoming domestic violence court case for later once you ve finished with a section you can set it aside as you find a new place to begin previewing and reading by the time you ve read all or most of the sections you should feel a sense of satisfaction as you collect that new pile of papers for recycling or reuse determine your own opinion and note your own biases when you re reading the editorial section or the op ed opposite the editorial page remember that you re reading the opinions of those writers and not necessarily straight facts before you begin you should read the article title to get an idea of the topic and then take a moment to consider your own opinion first 8 x research source even though the news section is strictly informational being aware of your own opinions and biases before reading those articles will help you to be more open minded about difficult topics try reading opinion pieces that are in opposition to your own views even if you don t agree you might learn something new whether it s a different way to defend your opinion or a new perspective on the issue altogether connect your reading to your own life and other news sources even if you re reading to relax taking a moment to see the relationship between the articles you re reading and your own experiences or concerns can lead to a more enjoyable experience ask yourself can i connect the ideas or events that i m reading about to my own life and the other stories i ve read about this topic 9 x research source making connections between your tv news and internet video clips and a printed newspaper will help you to become even more informed about the topic and engaged as a citizen 10 x research source decide how much of the newspaper you want to read sometimes you may want to read a particularly long newspaper like the sunday edition or you may have a requirement for a course in school if you have limited time but you want to read the whole paper your strategy will be different than if you need to read specific sections for an assignment if you need or want to read the entire paper but have only a small window of time plan to use previewing and skimming strategies if you have an assignment or a particular topic you re interested in reading about then you ll be focused on the finding only the appropriate articles quickly and reading them carefully skim the headlines and pictures on all of the pages one at a time the front page section is the most valuable real estate in the paper and the editors reserve it for the biggest or most popular stories reading the headlines will give you an idea of the most important happenings either locally nationally or internationally and the images are chosen to establish the central or most interesting idea in a given story this overview should take about three minutes and you ll have a better idea of where you want to start 11 x research source start on the first page the most important story by long newspaper tradition should appear at the top right of the front page the second most important story will appear at the top left also editors use larger type for bigger stories 12 x research source checking the table of contents if you re looking for a particular topic section or article will save you time since you won t have to search the newspaper blindly some newspapers include mini headlines at the very top of the page to catch readers attention for stories in interior sections of the paper such as sports or entertainment read the first paragraphs of the articles each time you begin a new article read just the first paragraph or two newspaper articles always start with a lede or lead which contains the most important information the rest of the article fills out the story with details in order of importance if you re reading efficiently the first paragraph should give you enough information for a general understanding of the topic if something in an article catches your attention keep reading but be ready to move on if your curiosity is satisfied if you re reading for an assignment use the lede to help you set up your summary notes as it s the main idea of the passage articles should answer the questions who what where how so use those questions to structure your notes if necessary read every article in a section if an article in full contains a jump line or instructions to continue the story on another page complete that story on the new page and then return to the original section to continue reading avoid starting on the new page and possibly wasting time later trying to remember which articles you d forgotten to read in earlier sections you can also simply skim all of the articles especially if you re in a hurry but want to get a snapshot of the main ideas if you re reading for an assignment or if you have a particular subject of interest you can also scan all of the articles for key words of your topic you can then read just those articles more carefully set aside each section as you complete it if you have space and want the encouragement that you re reading at a good pace setting the completed sections aside will provide you with a tangible reminder of your accomplishments choose a local newspaper if you want more community engagement local newspapers both dailies and weeklies can connect you to your community s residents politics and happenings and will be written by local writers with a vested interest in your area these papers tend to have more reporter initiated stories rather than mostly stories based on national news which means they re more proactive and less reactive in nature 13 x research source some local news are daily while others are weekly or bi weekly weekly newspapers will be even more community centered since they have more time to fully develop and research local stories local newspapers will employ not only writers from your community but they will also use community members as sources and so you may find the stories even more relevant to your own life choose a national newspaper if you want wider coverage of national issues national news outlets such as usa today or the guardian will include stories with wider appeal but many of the stories will be wire service pieces such as those from the reuters or the associate press ap they ll include information on national weather trends and major political stories and they re more likely to have a significant online presence some very large metro area newspapers such as the la times or the chicago tribune can be a good blend of local news stories and significant national coverage national news outlets may offer more perspectives on many issues as their staff writers might be located throughout the country rather than in a single city choose an international or foreign paper to discover new perspectives international newspaper outlets can provide you with a new look at familiar issues or a chance to learn about a different culture the newspapers of each country or region present their stories from the viewpoint of its culture highlighting the values and positive attributes of that area of the world if you read critically you can pay attention to that bias as well as your own and gain a new understanding of the truth of a story 14 x research source some bias exists in popular newspapers such as russia today and the australian associated press reporting on war and conflicts primarily through either overreporting or underreporting of violence other issues arise from oversimplification of complicated national and international issues 15 x research source 16 x research source decide if you want to read a physical newspaper or an online version if you want the top stories with up to the minute information and links to other perspectives on the same issues try a digital newspaper edition for possibly more in depth coverage including more editorializing or responses from other readers such as letters to the editor go for print 17 x research source not all local papers will have comparable online coverage for instance the community impact news in texas includes only some stories on their website though they have enormous local print circulation 18 x research source some newspapers particularly national and international papers will charge a subscription fee for online access for example the new york times charges from 1 88 8 75 a week for a subscription depending on your level of access some online news sites even those with print editions may use inadequate research and intentionally misleading tactics to encourage traffic to their sites 19 x research source 20 x research source choose a newspaper that presents the news honestly and the opinions separately newspapers are a mix of factual news and opinionated editorials a news reporter should offer as many validated and researched facts as available and an editorial should be clearly marked in a particular section of the paper check for credible sources and inappropriate stereotypes in headlines and stories 21 x research source 22 x research source ask yourself who is telling the story if a story about the economy focuses on stockbrokers instead of the everyday people affected by a recession the newspaper may not only be biased but also out of touch with its readers 23 x research source find out more about the editorial staff and writers do they represent the diversity of the community that they serve if not then the stories may show further evidence of bias particularly on coverage of news on parts of the community not represented at the paper,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to cosplay,cosplaying is a lot of work whether you choose to make commission or buy your cosplay you need to spend a lot of time researching and putting together your cosplay once you have it finished you still need to add the details such as hair and makeup having a few poses in mind and knowing how to get into character would also be a good idea despite all of this work cosplaying is fun and the effort is worth it,decide who you want to cosplay choose a character you can relate to or that you are similar to keep in mind that you don t have to cosplay as your race body type or gender anyone can cosplay on a similar note your cosplay does not have to be from anime or anything of japanese origin you can cosplay a character from a movie television show or even a western animation e g disney 1 x research source if this is your first time cosplaying however you may want to choose a character with a simpler design get reference pictures don t just get any reference pictures however get the ones of the specific version of the character you are dressing up as many characters have multiple outfits some characters costumes change slightly from film to film for example iron man s body suit changes a little in each iron man and avengers film batman spots a different design with each film as well 2 x research source this may not be possible with fan art in this case get the best quality image of the fan art you are basing your cosplay on determine how much money and effort you are willing to put into your cosplay you don t need to spend a lot of money in order to have a great looking cosplay if you want your cosplay to look great for cheap however be prepared to spend lots of time on it some cosplays will also require more than just sewing such as casting parts in resin or making foam armor the more time you have before the event the more elaborate you can make your cosplay if the event is this weekend consider something simpler design your own cosplay if you want to be more original you can always go with a screen accurate version of the character you are cosplaying alternatively you can put a unique spin on it such as a historically accurate version of a disney princess or a steampunk version of a character you can even do a crossover between two costumes such as a sailor scout version of a pokemon look at pictures of other people s cosplays or fan art for inspiration if you decide to base your cosplay off of someone s fan art ask the artist for permission it s the polite thing to do plan ahead and give yourself time to finish your cosplay even if you are buying your cosplay you still need to account the time it takes to create it if you are commissioning someone to make it and the time it takes to ship it out if you are making the cosplay you might want to give yourself extra time to fix any mistakes 3 x research source the more difficult and detailed the costume is the more time you ll need to make it make a list of everything you need this includes every piece of the entire outfit down to the belt gloves and shoes it should also include things like wigs if you are using one makeup and any necessary undergarments if you are going to make the cosplay write down the materials you ll need for each piece 4 x research source for example white blouse white cotton white thread white buttons green skirt dark green twill or wool suiting matching thread zipper hook closure brown loafers white knee socks skin toned bra use patterns when sewing your cosplay you can buy a pattern from the fabric store or draft your own if you decide to use store bought patterns be prepared to modify them to suit the character and your figure many patterns also include a list of recommended fabric types take these into consideration you may need to change the shape of the hem or sleeves on the pattern if a pattern is the right shape but the wrong length you ll need to add subtract length to from it don t be afraid to change the shape of a collar to suit your cosplay don t be afraid or ashamed to buy pieces for your cosplay you don t have to make everything from scratch if your cosplay requires an everyday item it would be easier to just buy it 5 x research source for example if you are cosplaying kagome from inuyasha it would be much cheaper easier and faster to buy a pair of knee socks rather than make them yourself consider buying and modifying piece to suit your cosplay sometimes you may come across an item that is the right shape but the wrong color other times you may come across something that is the right color but a little too long instead of making a whole new piece get the almost right piece then modify it 6 x research source for example if something is the right shape but the wrong color dye it if something is too long or has sleeves cut it don t forget to hem it though if needed paint boots to match your cosplay or make boot covers for them do your research when buying or commissioning a cosplay there is no guarantee that the cosplay will fit you perfectly especially if you buy it from a cosplay shop the quality may be top notch or it may be sub par most importantly research the company or the person you are buying or commissioning the cosplay from make sure that they are reliable don t forget the props and accessories while not absolutely necessary they can really take your cosplay to the next level a prop can help you come up with more creative poses while accessories can make your cosplay more realistic as with the rest of your cosplay you can make buy or commission your props and accessories many animated films use simple designs if you are cosplaying as a disney princess consider adding some jewelry or hair pieces read the convention s rules regarding props to find out what is and what isn t allowed plan out your look as with the costume think about how the character s hair and makeup would translate into real life can you get away with using your real hair or will you need to get a wig makeup will help you look better in photos but do you want a more stylized or a more realistic look take a moment to think about what sort of look you are going for use your own hair if you are willing to cut it or dye it if your hair is almost right for the character but not quite don t be afraid to straighten it curl it or add extensions if you are more daring you can even dye your hair or cut it to better suit the character only do this if you actually like the style however you ll be stuck with it for a few months 7 x research source use a high quality wig if you don t want to mess with your real hair for the best look purchase a high quality wig from a reputable wig or costume shop avoid using the cheap wigs from the party or halloween store if you want your cosplay to look even more realistic you can get a lace front wig instead 8 x research source wear a wig cap under the wig make sure that it is skin toned or that it matches your wig use bobby pins that keep your wig in place make sure that they match the wig color pin your hair up under the wig you don t want it sticking out under the wig style your hair or the wig whether you are using your own hair or a wig you ll need to style it most wigs rarely look like the intended character s hair so you ll likely need to trim it in some cases you ll need to straighten it or curl it you will also need to comb your hair or the wig into the right style then set it with hairspray use hairspray and styling wax to shape your hair if you are styling a wig invest in a styrofoam wig head do not use curling irons or flat irons on wigs use the hot water curling or straightening method wear makeup even if you are a guy or cross playing a male character makeup is important for cosplay it makes your skin appear smoother and more photogenic for most characters you will need a natural look basic foundation neutral eyeshadow and eyeliner if you are cosplaying a girl you can add mascara or false lashes from there you can bring more life to your character with lipstick and contouring or blush 9 x research source you can use contouring to make your face look more feminine or masculine even male characters can benefit from lipstick use a neutral color you can use a different color of eyeshadow but only if it suits the character and costume practice getting into cosplay before the big event this includes applying the makeup putting the wig on putting in and taking out contact lenses etc if something doesn t fit or feel comfortable take a moment to fix it make sure that your cosplay is comfortable and durable 10 x research source if you are having troubles with contact lenses leave them out don t leave costume contact lenses in your eyes for the entire convention that is asking for a serious infection get into character you don t necessarily have to act like your character although you can if you want to it would be a good idea to have some poses in mind however people love to take pictures of other people s cosplays at conventions so there is a high chance that someone might want to take a picture of yours 11 x research source be respectful of other people s boundaries there is nothing wrong with getting into character if you see someone from the same anime or series be aware that not everyone will want to play along with you if they don t play along apologize and leave them alone don t harass them or force them to play with you try not to take things too seriously cosplay is supposed to be fun instead of comparing yourself to everyone else feel proud of the work you did meet up with friends or make new ones if you are shy consider going to some panels gathering or other events there is lots to do at conventions while in cosplay 12 x research source if you do like competition consider joining the cosplay contest or masquerade most conventions will have one remember that cosplay is not consent if someone makes you feel uncomfortable speak up report them to security or con ops if someone is harassing you and con ops or security are not around call for help while these instances are not common at conventions they still happen your safety is very important 13 x research source stay smart don t go to empty or solitary places with people you don t know stick with a friend or a person you trust especially if you are out at night,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to teach yourself to read,if you or somebody you know cannot read you re not alone 14 percent of american adults can t read that s 32 million people and 21 read below a 5th grade level the good news is it s never too late to learn how to read this article can help you or someone close to you develop their skills as a reader,begin with the alphabet the alphabet is where reading begins the 26 letters that make up the english alphabet are used to form all of the words in the english language so this is the place to start there are several ways to get familiar with the alphabet pick the one that suits you and your learning style sing it it may seem silly but there s a reason so many people have learned the alphabet by singing the alphabet song it works the melody aids in memorization and the song as a whole gives learners a picture of the entire alphabet and the relationship between letters you can listen to the alphabet song online or get someone you know to sing and record it for you so that you can listen to it over and over again as you learn it feel it if you re a hands on learner consider buying sandpaper letters look at a letter and then close your eyes trace your fingers over the letter and repeat the name of the letter and its sound when you re ready pick your finger up off the sandpaper and write the letter in the air move it around pick up a set of alphabet magnets as a way of learning the individual letters as well as the way they re sequenced in the alphabet later you can reuse these letters to practice forming words walk it out if you have the room try using an alphabet mat as a learning tool say each letter and its sound as you step on that letter on your mat have someone call out letters or sounds at random and step on the correct corresponding letter get your whole body voice included involved by singing the alphabet song and making up a dance as you step your way through the alphabet distinguish vowels from consonants there are five vowels in the alphabet a e i o u the rest of the letters are called consonants you make vowel sounds in your throat with the help of your tongue and mouth while you form consonants by using your tongue and mouth to control the flow of your breath vowels can be spoken alone but consonants can t for example the letter a is simply a but b is actually bee c is see d is dee and so on use phonics phonics is all about relationships specifically the relationships between letters and sounds in a language for example when you learn that the letter c sounds like sa or ka or that tion sounds like shun you re learning phonics find an approach that makes sense to you phonics is typically taught in one of two ways by what s called a see and say approach in which you learn to read whole words or a syllable approach in which you learn how to sound out different letter combinations and put them together to form words to learn phonics you must hear the sounds of the syllables and or words to do that you need to find an online program purchase or borrow a dvd from your local library or work with a family member friend tutor or instructor who can help you learn the sounds created by various letter combinations and what those look like written out recognize punctuation marks it s important to know what common punctuation marks indicate when you re reading because they can offer information about sentence meanings comma when you see a comma you re meant to pause or slightly hesitate when you re reading period a period indicates the end of a sentence when you reach a period come to a complete stop and take a deep breath before continuing to read question mark when you ask a question your voice goes up when you see at the end of sentence a question is being asked so make sure your voice rises when you re reading exclamation point this mark is used to emphasize an important point or to grab attention when you read a sentence that ends with be sure to sound excited or to strongly emphasize the words choose meaningful reading material since the best readers read with a purpose it makes sense for you to begin with materials you want to or need to read in your everyday life these can include things such as short and simple newspapers and magazine articles work memos schedules and medical instructions read aloud the best way to get familiar with the words on the page is to say them out loud working with a teaching partner sound out unfamiliar words and use the pictures verbal explanations and context to figure our the meaning of the new words make time to read reading often and for sustained uninterrupted periods of time will help you develop vocabulary and become a more proficient reader set aside specific amounts of time each day to devote to reading keep track of what you read and for how long by creating a reading log attack the words word attack strategies can help you figure out the meaning and pronunciation of unfamiliar words by taking on those words piece by piece and coming at them from different angles look for picture clues check out the photos illustrations or other visuals on the page explore what s in them people places objects actions that might make sense in the sentence sound out the word starting with the first letter say each letter sound out loud slowly then repeat the sounds blending them together to form the word and considering if the word makes sense in the sentence chunk it up look at the word and see if you can pick out any sound symbols prefixes suffixes endings or base words that you already know read each chunk by itself and then try blending the chunks together and sound out the word for example if you know that pre means before and view means to look at you could figure out that preview means to look at ahead of time if you approached the word by breaking it up into those two chunks look for connections consider whether the unfamiliar word bears any resemblance to a word you might already know ask yourself if it s a chunk or a form of the unfamiliar word you could also try using the known word in the sentence to see if it makes sense it could be that the meanings of the two words are close enough for understanding reread go back over the sentence again try substituting different words for the word you don t know and see if any of your ideas make sense keep reading rather than getting stuck on a word you don t know read past it and look for more clues if the word is used again in the text compare that sentence to the first and brainstorm as to what word might make sense in both rely on prior knowledge take into account what you know about the topic of the book paragraph or sentence based on your knowledge of the subject matter is there a word that might make sense in the sentence make predictions look at the pictures table of contents chapter headings maps diagrams and other features of your book then based on what you saw write down what you think the book will be about what kinds of information might be included as you read keep updating your predictions based on what comes up in the text ask questions after reviewing the title chapter headings images and other information in the book write down some questions you might have or things you re now curious about try to answer these questions as you read and write down the answers you find if you re left with questions think about whether you could find those answers from some other source visualize think of the story you re reading as though it were a movie get a good mental image of the characters and the setting and try to see the story unfolding in time and space identify and describe what s happening by making sketches diagrams or cartoon style grids make connections ask yourself if there s anything about the story you can relate to do any of the characters remind you of someone you know have you had similar experiences have you learned some of the concepts discussed in the book at school home or through your own life experiences does the style of the story resemble a style you ve read before or a movie or television show you ve seen write down any similarities you come up with and use them to help with your understanding of the text retell the story one helpful way to ensure that something you ve read makes sense to you is to talk through it with someone else once you ve finished a paragraph article short story or chapter sum up in your own words what it was about hearing yourself say it out loud and discovering if the person on the receiving end has questions you can or can t answer can point out any gaps in your understanding and what you might need to reread for greater clarity access lincs the literacy information and communication service is an online resource sponsored by the u

how to count music,while there are many musicians who can learn music by ear most beginners should learn how to read music understanding how to count music is also important to dancers and can contribute to the enjoyment of a casual listener part of reading music is the ability to count it or knowing how long to hold each note on the page it is also important to understand what a time signature is this article describes the basic principles of counting using 4 4 time and introduces time signatures,understand what a measure is music is divided into measures which are designated by a vertical line notes in music are named based on how much time they take up within a measure think of the measure as a pie that can be cut into quarters halves eighths or a combination of different notes 1 x research source learn basic notation in a 4 4 time signature the names of the notes clue you in to how much of the measure they will take this will necessitate a rudimentary understanding of fractions a whole note will take the whole measure a half note will take half of the measure from there you can figure out that quarter notes take a quarter of the measure eighth notes take one eighth of the measure sixteenth notes take one sixteenth of the measure notes can be combined to make one whole for instance 1 half note and 2 quarter notes makes 1 whole measure practice keeping the beat in an even rhythm tap your heel and count to 4 repeatedly like this 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 the speed is less important than keeping the time even between each number a metronome can also be helpful in setting an even beat each full cycle of 1 2 3 4 is 1 measure practice counting basic note lengths say or sing la while continuing to keep up the counting in your head a whole note will take the whole measure so begin singing la at the number 1 and hold it until you have reached 4 you have just performed a whole note 2 half notes make up a measure sing la for 1 2 then a new la for 3 4 there are 4 quarter notes in a measure sing la for each number you re tapping add syllables for smaller notes for eighth notes you will need to divide the measure into 8 even pieces but you are still only beating 4 times per measure add the word and between each number as you count like this 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and practice this until it becomes easy each word is 1 eighth note use a similar principle to count sixteenth notes you will need to fit 16 sounds into 1 measure and do it evenly one common way to do this is to say 1 e and a 2 e and a 3 e and a 4 e and a remember that the numbers should still be played and sung perfectly evenly 2 x research source the same general idea can be applied to even smaller notes but as these notes appear rarely they are less important to master as a beginner understand what a dot means sometimes in music there is a small dot immediately after a note this dot indicates that the note s length should be increased by 50 a half note normally worth 2 beats becomes 3 beats with a dot a quarter note worth 1 beat without the dot takes 1 5 beats with a dot practice triplets triplets are when 1 beat is divided into 3 notes this is tricky because otherwise all the notes you have practiced are even fractions vocalizing syllables can help you get the hang of triplets practice counting triplets by saying 1 e and 2 e and 3 e and 4 e and remember to continue keeping the numbers even using a metronome or tapping your foot break the rules a fermata is a sign that looks like a dot with an eyebrow over a note when you see this symbol it means that note can be held for as long as you like regardless of what the music might say if you are part of an ensemble the director will determine how long it should be held if you are performing solo consider in advance what will be most appropriate length listen to recordings of your piece if you are uncertain how long to hold this will give you a sense of what other performers have done and you can decide what sounds best find the time signature at the top left hand corner of a piece of music you will see several notations the first is a symbol called the clef which typically depends on the instrument for which the piece was composed next there may be some sharps or flats finally you will see 2 numbers stacked on top of each other this is the time signature for the first part of this article we used the signature 4 4 which is indicated by 2 fours stacked on top of one another understand the significance of each number in the time signature the top number indicates the number of beats in a measure and the bottom number is which note value gets the beat it is most common for a 4 to appear on the bottom giving the quarter note the beat 3 x research source in 4 4 time the top note tells you that there are 4 beats in a measure and the bottom note tells you that a quarter note gets the beat in 2 4 time there are 2 beats in a measure but you are still counting a quarter note as a beat so instead of counting 1 2 3 4 you would use that same pace but simply say 1 2 1 2 practice a waltz music set in 3 4 time counts 3 quarter notes to every measure the waltz is always danced in this rhythm and finding a song that is designated as a waltz may help you to hear the pattern more clearly as you listen count 1 2 3 in your head the song christmas waltz has a distinctive waltz rhythm and also contains the lyrics and this song of mine in three quarter time tipping you off to the rhythm review less common time signatures the top number always denotes the number of beats in a measure and the bottom always signifies what note gets the beat if the bottom number is an 8 then you should count eighth notes if the bottom number is a 2 then you should count half notes 6 8 meter is like the waltz in that the beats are grouped into threes but there are 2 of them beats 1 and 4 should get the emphasis one two three four five six beat 1 is the strongest beat 4 x research source 3 2 times means you should count 3 half notes for 1 measure 1 half note is worth 2 quarter notes try counting evenly to 6 emphasizing the odd numbers one two three four five six one two three four five six by emphasizing the odd numbers you re pointing out where each half note begins by counting the even numbers you re ensuring a regular pace practice counting while listening to music the time signature gives a distinctive rhythmic sound to different types of music for example composers often write marches in 2 4 time to give a distinctive feeling of boots stepping 1 2 1 2 pop country and other music aimed at a broad audience typically has some form of 2 or 4 in the time signature because people like to tap their foot along with the music choosing a simple time signature makes it easy for a general audience to enjoy it jazz and other modern music often sounds disjointed because of unusual time signatures such as 13 8 5 4 and other uneven divisions this will be a challenge to count but may help you see how the time signature contributes to the overall feel of music,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to pick a stage name,stage names are used by all types of performers from musicians actors and roller derby athletes to burlesque dancers belly dancers and exotic dancers a stage name can help a performer craft and reflect their public persona or connect with the audience more effectively a stage name can also help a performer maintain a separation between their public life and their personal life,understand what a stage name can do for you a stage name can help you accomplish a number of things which all can influence how you decide on your name branding a stage name can help you brand your performance persona giving you a separate identity to develop as a brand separation of personal and professional life a stage name will be a very public name possibly a household name while some people might still know your real name keeping your real name separate from your stage name can afford you some level of privacy differentiation if your real name is very common a stage name can help you stand out and be more memorable prejudice considerations some people have used stage names in the past in order to decrease immediate reactions of racism anti semitism or other forms of prejudice luckily this is less often the case today similarly some women may have avoided a hyphenated name because it might indicate they re married which unfortunately some consider to be detrimental to their careers choose a name that reflects your persona your stage name is a way to express yourself what do you want your name to signify think about how a stage name might be able to channel your performance persona have a story behind your name whatever your stage name people will likely want to know how you decided to call yourself that if it s an uninteresting story then perhaps think about making up a more exciting story to go with your name 1 x research source do research about your name look online and in name books to learn the meaning of the name you ve chosen learn the history of the name does the name s meaning and history reflect what you want it to mean choose a searchable name think about how people can find your name through search engines like google if you use very common words especially single words like trouble or heart it may be hard for fans to find you online choose a name that will grow with you there can be the appeal of choosing a name that reflects the moment where you might follow a fad also consider where you want to be in 10 or 20 years does your stage name suit an older performer just as well as a younger one child performers should consider how their names will grow with them as they get older joe yule called himself mickey rooney a good name for a kid actor but it was less useful as an adult actor similarly lil bow wow had to drop lil when he grew up 2 x research source choose a name that you won t get tired of quickly if you think you might hate your stage name in six months think of a different moniker use a childhood nickname you may have been called something other than your real name throughout childhood and this nickname might be useful as a stage name for example richard melville hall was nicknamed moby by his parents and he uses this as his stage name 3 x research source use your middle name go with a singular name that is just your middle name such as the rapper drake whose real name is aubrey drake graham 4 x research source similarly angelina jolie voight dropped her last name moving her middle name to the surname position use your family tree as inspiration use your great grandmother s first name or your great uncle s middle name this can help you retain a connection to your family with your stage name 5 x research source use your last name some performers use just their last name dropping their first name because it is hard to pronounce or they ve always disliked their name liberace for example dropped his first name wladziu and just went by one name some performers may have started their careers with their full names or with a stage first and last name reinventing your career may involve reinventing your name but you might still want to hang onto some of the reputation or recognition that you already have drop your last name from your stage name and go with just a single name alternately add your last name if you ve been using a single name consider adding a last name to reinvent yourself you might also change or alter your last name some performers add last names with or without a hyphen such as courtney cox adding arquette to her last name when she got married she dropped arquette when the marriage ended choose the same last name as your parent s stage last name if you have performers in your family you may want to link your stage name with their stage names these can help you gain a reputation and recognition among fans and employers for example carlos irwin estévez became charlie sheen in order to match his last name to his actor father martin sheen whose real name is ramón antonio gerardo estévez another son emilio kept the family last name consider changing the spelling of your name if you have a name that you like you might fiddle with the spelling to see if alternate letters will make it more interesting the band gotye pronounced go tee ay is a respelling of the french surname gaultier 6 x research source sometimes this isn t a good idea especially if you re adding an extra letter where it is really unnecessary you might just risk confusing people and making it difficult to pronounce your name avoid symbols in your name while it may be a hot thing to replace an s in your name with a or an i with a these just add confusion and likely mistakes in spelling your name even though ke ha and others have done it you should skip this the singer prince changed his name to a symbol in order to get out of his contract with warner bros in 1993 since the symbol was unpronounceable he was called the artist formerly known as prince this really only works if you already have a well established reputation and fan following and ultimately would make things too complicated anyway prince reverted to being called prince after his contract with warner bros expired 7 x research source add an exotic element some stage names may benefit from exoticizing them this happens frequently for burlesque and pinup performers adding words such as von de or la can make your name more exotic or exciting consider how people will pronounce your name if you have a very unique name you may find that people have a lot of trouble pronouncing it think about actors quvenzhané wallis saoirse ronan or ralph fiennes these are difficult names to pronounce and often require pronunciation guides in news articles 8 x research source think of alternative spellings of your name that will facilitate people pronouncing it correctly once you are well known however you will likely overcome this problem consider your international profile will your name travel well with you if you start performing overseas since the internet has enabled fans from all over the world to connect with performers think about how your name resonates with different cultures around the world be consistent with spelling and formatting if you do choose to use alternative spelling or unique formatting of your name keep it consistent do not fluctuate between using an s and a choose one and stick to it try out your name your name might sound great to you when you say it out loud in your bedroom find out how it sounds when someone else is announcing you think of this as market testing your name don t legally change your name unless you are completely abandoning your real name altogether there is no need to legally change your name this will help you maintain a distinction between your personal and professional lives register your stage name with a trade guild or union if you are currently a member of a trade guild such as the screen actors guild or the american federation of musicians you should update your membership information with your stage name it s best to ensure that no one else in your guild has the same name as you 9 x research source if you are not yet part of a union or guild you may consider joining one sometime in the future in this case keep in mind that you should probably register with your real name and stage name in one membership update your bank account information you may want to include your stage name on your bank account this is especially true if you have a business bank account and you are earning money under your stage name be sure that the account has both of your names listed to avoid confusion reserve social media accounts with your stage name once you ve chosen your stage name make sure you have an online presence with that name start a facebook page that isn t your personal account figure out a twitter id and start an account reserve a website domain once you ve chosen your stage name reserve a website domain with your name it s a good idea to reserve a domain name to avoid someone misusing your name or capitalizing on your success for their own gain known as cybersquatting 10 x research source search a domain name registrar such as godaddy com or dotster com to make sure your domain name isn t already taken register your web name with a name registrar choose the length of time you want to reserve the domain name you can reserve it in year increments for up to 10 years you will need to pay a fee which can fluctuate by registrar and by year to year typically these run 10 to 15 for the initial registration

how to get front row at a concert,the front row at a concert is a coveted spot and if you want to be up there you ll need to be resourceful and determined if a concert has assigned seating you ll need to be on your a game while shopping for tickets general admission tickets while typically the cheapest ones you can buy come at a different cost when you don t have assigned seating it s every person for themselves it won t be an easy journey to the front row but it ll be worth it,try to purchase front row tickets the minute they go on sale if the concert venue or the musical artist has a mailing list sign up oftentimes they ll offer pre sale tickets which can increase your chances of getting a limited front row spot if you re willing to shell out a little more you can also look into purchasing a vip package that often comes with premium seating 1 x research source whether you re trying to purchase via pre sale or regular sale make sure to set your alarm and be on the ticket website right when tickets go on sale the faster you are the more tickets you ll have to choose from if there are no front row tickets available you can try the high risk high reward approach of waiting until the day of the concert to check again some venues will release more premium seats right before doors open typically these are tickets that the artist or venue management reserved that ended up being unused sometimes you can even find front row tickets through scalpers or craigslist however you may not be able to get tickets until right before the concert and buying them from an unauthorized vendor comes with risks arrive right when the doors open if you have general admission tickets sometimes this is only an hour before the show begins and other times it s hours depending on how committed you are to getting a spot in the front row you should get there as early as you can 2 x research source you can stake out a prime spot before the venue begins to fill up this of course is the easiest way to get a front row spot without fighting through crowds sometimes you have to take this step to the extreme and camp out before a big concert you may have to camp out in a line to get your front row tickets you can learn all about camping out overnight here arriving super early or camping out can turn a simple concert into a weekend long event bring your favorite friends and make it a party bring the proper supplies if it s an outdoor venue you may be able to claim your territory with picnic blankets or lawn chairs sunscreen and a water bottle if allowed are also helpful so you can stay in your spot comfortably if it s indoor and standing room only you ll need to wear comfortable shoes so you can post up pain free look up the venue beforehand so you know what to expect and which items are allowed it s also important to consider the venue to ensure that you dress appropriately if you re going to be squeezed into a small bar you may want to wear less clothing so you don t overheat if you re going to an outdoor concert you may want to bring a jacket for chillier temperatures after the sun sets 3 x research source another supply you should bring is a good cell phone battery you ll want a fully charged cell phone to make sure it lasts for the whole concert you do not want to risk getting separated from your friends without a cell phone reduce your liquid intake a few hours before the concert this sounds ridiculous but there is no way you ll be able to hold your spot if you re running off to the bathroom not only does dibs not work at a concert but you ll also have to fight through crowds of people and stand in long lines to avoid this just ease up on the water or booze in plenty of time 4 x research source sometimes bathroom trips are unavoidable that s ok unless you re at the concert alone you can take turns in the bathroom with whoever you re with that way one person can hold the spot take the path of least resistance it s probably not wise to charge straight through the middle of the crowd instead try to get as close to the front as you can by weaving down the side of the crowd along the perimeter once you ve gotten as close to the front as you can with that method try shimmying your way into the crowd sideways 5 x research source people will probably be more willing to let you through when you are coming from the side rather than rushing them from behind they ll likely think you re finding a new spot rather than cutting in front of people link hands with your friends this is especially important in packed venues where there is a risk of getting separated and lost from the people you came with link hands so you can weave through the crowd as a chain you won t be able to walk side by side in a crowd so just firmly join hands to stay together if the crowd is more aggressive there is always a chance that you will get separated from your friends in these situations it s important that everyone has cell phones so you can safely find each other if there is no cell phone service at the venue make sure you have a designated meeting spot be assertive but polite this is most important for the person at the front of your linked chain you have to be a little forceful to get around people but you should still be saying please and thank you people will be much more inclined to help you if you treat them respectfully if someone won t budge even after you say please then you can get a little sassy don t feel shy about speaking up and forcing your way through people chances are you ll never see those people again but you will always remember seeing the artist up close sacrifice the beer you ll never maintain your spot in the front row if you re leaving to stand in line at the concession stand even if you send a friend to fetch the beverages you run the risk of being overtaken by a larger group of concert goers or being permanently separated from your friend if you can ditch the beer to ensure you keep your spot 6 x research source if the venue is less crowded smaller or just easier to navigate in general feel free to take your chances the rebellious concert goers can try bringing a flask if it doesn t get confiscated on your way in it can help you preserve your good spot and save you money take a power stance if you look meek and unsure of yourself other concert goers behind you and to the side of you will have no issue bumping into you and taking your spot instead stand confidently to claim your space keep your legs hip width apart and your shoulders pulled back hold your head high don t be afraid to take up your rightful front row space 7 x research source if concert goers are bumping into you or trying to steal your spot despite your power stance have a powerful attitude to match speak up make steady eye contact and tell them to back up dance sing and have fun if you re in the front row you ve got to prove that you deserve to be there if you re standing solemnly with your arms crossed and looking disinterested the more hardcore fans will likely usurp your space dance sing along and go crazy at the concert and if you ve got the front row how could you not be having fun put your phone away it can be fun to snap a few pictures or videos but it can also be annoying to everyone around you enjoy the live music you re experiencing and put your phone away until later 8

how to analyze tone in literature,in literature tone refers to the author s attitude toward the subject characters or events of a story 1 x research source understanding the tone of a literary work can help you become a better reader you may also need to analyze the tone of a literary work for an essay or assignment for class to analyze tone start by recognizing common tones in literature then determine the tone in a literary work and describe it effectively so you get high marks on your essay,notice if the tone is solemn or gloomy one of the most common tones in literature is a solemn or gloomy tone where the tone feels heavy or serious often the tone comes across as bleak or dark if it is solemn you may respond to a solemn literary work by feeling sad or unsettled 2 x research source a good example of a solemn or gloomy tone is in the short story the school by donald barthelme recognize a suspenseful tone another common tone in literature is a suspenseful tone which creates a sense of dread and anticipation in the reader often you may feel on the edge of your seat or full of anxiety as you read a literary work with a suspenseful tone 3 x research source a good example of a suspenseful tone is in the short story the lottery by shirley jackson 4 x research source take note of a humorous tone a work of literature with a humorous tone will often make the reader laugh or smile it can come across as playful witty or ironic sometimes writers use a humorous tone to counter a solemn tone in the same work such as in a novel or a short story 5 x research source a good example of a humorous tone is the poem snowball by shel silverstein notice a sarcastic tone a sarcastic tone is often used to invoke laughter or amusement in the reader it may come across as biting and critical you can find a sarcastic tone in novels and short stories particularly if they are told in the first person with a narrator who has a sarcastic or dry sense of humor 6 x research source a good example of a sarcastic tone is in the novel the catcher in the rye by j d salinger recognize the connection between tone and genre in many cases the genre of the piece can give you clues about the tone for instance a suspenseful tone is often found in thriller novels or mystery stories while a humorous tone is often found in works of comedy and satire be aware of the difference between mood and tone in literature it can be tricky to distinguish between mood and tone in literature especially because they are often connected or interrelated mood is different from tone in that it describes the setting and atmosphere of a text mood is created through the reader s response to the tone in a work however both mood and tone are shaped by the writer s ability to convey emotion in the reader 7 x research source for example if a story is set in an abandoned cabin the woods it may have a creepy or unsettling mood the author may then have a narrator or main character who uses a gloomy or depressing tone to describe the cabin in the woods to the reader notice the word choice and language one way you can determine tone in a literary work is to pay attention to the words and language used by the author consider why the author chose certain words or language to describe a scene think about why certain words were used to discuss a character think about how these choices create tone 8 x research source for example you may study a passage from the short story the school and the trees all died i don t know why they died they just died something wrong with the soil possibly or maybe the stuff we got from the nursery wasn t the best all these kids looking at these little brown sticks it was depressing in the passage barthelme creates a solemn gloomy tone by using words like depressing dead died and wrong look at the sentence structure read a few lines of the literary work and notice how the sentences are structured you may notice the sentences are short and often do not vary in length creating a certain tone or you may notice sentences that are long and winding down the page this could create a meditative or thoughtful tone 9 x research source for example in many thriller novels the sentences are often short and to the point with very few adjectives or adverbs this can help to create a suspenseful tone full of action and tension examine the imagery another way you can determine the tone of a piece is to look at the imagery used by the author to describe a setting scene or character certain imagery will create a certain tone to the piece strong imagery can tip you off to the tone intended by the author 10 x research source for example if a person s face is described as glowing with happiness and excitement this may create a joyful tone or if a cabin in the woods is described as grimy with the fingerprints of the previous occupants this may create a suspenseful tone determine if the author uses irony there are different kinds of irony including verbal situational and dramatic a situation is described as ironic if the expectations and reality of that situation are incongruous irony is often tied to sarcasm but not always take note of the use of irony in literature and examine how it contributes to the tone or to a tonal shift 11 x research source for example if someone says good thing i wore my parka today when the temperature is 85 f 29 c they re using verbal irony read the work out loud reading a work of literature out loud can help you get a better sense of the diction of the piece diction refers to how words sound next to one another in a sentence it is often more clear when a work is read out loud as you can hear how each word sounds and pay attention to how this creates a certain tone to the piece 12 x research source for example you may read the following lines from the catcher in the rye out loud to determine the tone god damn money it always ends up making you blue as hell the use of god damn and blue as hell gives the line a sarcastic or bitter tone with a hint of humor and sadness note that a work can have more than one tone it is common for an author to use more than one tone in a work of literature especially a long work like a novel you may notice that the tone shifts in the work from chapter to chapter narrator to narrator or scene to scene the author may do this to get into the particular voice of a character or to signal a shift in the characters or the action in the piece 13 x research source for example a novel may begin with a humorous tone and shift into a more serious tone as the author delves deeper into a character s history or personal relationships use adjectives to describe the tone of the literary work use specific adjectives that illustrate which tone the narrator is using such as gloomy solemn humorous or sarcastic the more specific you are when describing the tone the more insightful your analysis will be 14 x research source for example you may write the author uses words like super stoked awesome and exhilarating to create an upbeat tone you can use more than one adjective if this will make your description more accurate provide evidence from the text after describing the tone in detail use a few quotes from the text to back up your argument pick quotes that clearly illustrate tone based on word choice language diction or imagery for example if you are writing about the great gatsby by f scott fitzgerald you may use the last line of the book as an example so we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past you can then note that the imagery of a boat going against the current as well as the use of the words beat borne and past create a solemn nostalgic tone to the ending compare different tones in the same work if there is more than one tone in the work compare the different tones in your analysis this often occurs when the literary work is long such as a novel or an epic poem identify when the shifts in tone occur in the literary work discuss why you think the tone shifts and how it affected you as a reader note if the tonal shifts coincide with specific characters and or changes in perspective or viewpoint for example you may note the tone shifts in chapter 13 from a humorous tone to a more serious tone this occurs when the narrator discusses their mother s illness and death link the tone to other literary elements depending on the scope of the assignment make sure your analysis of tone is connected to other elements such as mood plot theme and style the tone of a work is often used to illustrate a larger theme or to create a distinct mood linking tone to these other elements can sharpen your analysis and make it that much stronger for example you may link the nostalgic solemn tone of the closing line in the great gatsby to the themes of remembrance loss and thwarted love in the novel,Arts-and-Entertainment

head straight there and wait for the person to exit there will likely be many people waiting but you may still get a photo or an autograph some performers may be very tired after performing a show and will not want to sign autographs or pose for photos always be polite and respectful and don t hassle anyone visit a talk show taping shows such as the daily show morning talk shows and late night talk shows all have many celebrity guests per week you can find taping schedules online so that you know when your favorite celebrity will be a guest 2 x research source like theaters talk shows also have stage doors often arriving and leaving a taping is a staged event complete with paparazzi and fans but you may be able to score a quick meeting depending on the celebrity and their schedule visit places that celebrities also visit while you may not be able to afford to shop at prada or louis vuitton you can still visit other places that celebrities also frequent in l a locales like the brentwood farmers market and whole foods are often frequented by celebrities doing their shopping stores usually don t look kindly on people who loiter without making purchases buying something from the store even if it s small or inexpensive will help ensure that you don t make yourself unwelcome wait outside the hotel where you know they are staying press conferences and premiers often run late so if you arrive in the morning you may see the celebrity leaving for work lingering in the hotel lobby may get you in trouble so consider having a drink in the hotel bar sit so that you can see who comes in and out of the hotel don t be disappointed if you don t see the person coming into or leaving the hotel many large hotels with a celebrity clientele have back entrances to protect their privacy wait near the tour vans for musicians if you have attended a concert ask where the tour vans are located and try to get in that area many bands pack up quickly after the show but some people may be hanging around and could introduce you get a job near where celebrities spend their time become a waiter at their favorite restaurant a bartender at their regular bar or a personal trainer at their gym working an eight hour shift greatly increases the odds you will be there when they are there make sure to get a job that lets you interact with the patrons jobs like valet parking and coat check while not particularly exciting are likely to put you in contact with celebrities dining out or staying in hotels 3 x research source always be professional most employers at places that celebrities frequent will not look kindly at potential harassment of their famous clientele it s fine to start up a chat or even ask for a photograph under the right circumstances but if you become a nuisance you re not likely to keep your job arrive early at events you attend depending on the event some people may camp out overnight bring a book or some music to keep you entertained while you wait consider bringing a friend particularly if you will be arriving several hours early or waiting overnight you can save each other s spot in the line take turns going to the bathroom and bring back food and drinks as you wait decide what you want an autograph a photo you may be able to get both but if the person arrives late is hurried past you by her publicist or only spends a few minutes with fans it s best to know exactly what you will ask ask for your autograph to be personalized this decreases the likelihood you will sell the autographed item for money and increases the chances that they will sign it or maybe start a conversation with you 4 x research source be prepared have a pen or sharpie with you as well as something for the celebrity to sign such as a photograph or playbill if they re being generous and giving you an autograph make it as easy for them as possible prepare what you will say the celebrity may not have a lot of time so have a short introduction prepared tell them your name and a sentence or two that expresses your appreciation for their work clearly and politely state your request and always phrase it as a question may i take a photo with you rather than a statement i want to take a photo with you if you have a lot of things to say to the person consider writing a letter and handing it to them at the event they may read it when they have more time at a later date 5 x research source remain calm this person s music may have changed your life you may think the two of you are undiscovered soul mates but they have never met you before be friendly and polite but avoid gushing and hyperbole excessive fawning screaming or adoration may make them uncomfortable smile and be friendly celebrities are very busy people and do many press and publicity events every month don t be demanding or aggressive genuine friendliness and appreciation are more likely to be met with generosity always ask before taking a photograph it may come across as presumptive or rude to just whip out your phone and start snapping without permission step aside if you are attending an event or waiting at the stage door there will probably be many others waiting too after getting your photo handshake or autograph let others meet the celebrity they are likely just as excited as you are don t be disappointed if you don t get a handshake or if the meeting is very quick there will always be more opportunities,Arts-and-Entertainment

are playing it at a loud volume offer petting praise and treats to your pet for keeping calm 3 x research source playing loud noises after the fireworks can help to desensitize it further by showing it that what it just experienced is not scary turn the lights on and try to insulate the house as best you can keeping the lights on will calm your pet and make it feel more secure close the curtains in the room and if your animal is in a cage cover up the cage with a thick blanket which will hide it from flashing lights and dampen loud noises in a stable keep the lights on and keep the doors locked although sedatives are the best method to calm your outdoor farm animals use familiar sounds to drown out the noise of the fireworks classical music the sound of rain or the sound of the tv are some common noises that can soothe your pet 4 x research source provide a hiding place for your pets this will allow your pets somewhere safe that they can retreat to during the fireworks to feel safe try placing a heavy blanket over a crate or pet carrier or lay a box on its side and place a folded up blanket or towel inside of it 5 x research source find a central room away from windows to contain your pets a room that has no windows located in the middle of your home is ideal as it naturally dampens outside noises it should be a room you can close off to stop your pet from running about the house and creating a mess make sure your outdoor animals are locked in their pen and consider moving them to a more central pen in your barn or stable to keep them away from doors and windows if you have more than one pet be sure they don t mind being confined in the same room or select several rooms for different pets for example dogs and cats will usually appreciate being separated if you must separate animals make a second room as insulated as you can and keep the most anxious animal in the central room and stay with and comfort the animal in the second room try using

as feliway these products are available as plug in diffusers that you can purchase in pet stores and online consider veterinary sedation for large animals or easily scared animals consult your vet a few weeks ahead of time to see if your dog may need a sedative during the fireworks as some dogs are particularly noise sensitive or anxiety prone horses and farm animals that are kept outside particularly may need this to make it through without getting scared 7 x research source you can also ask your dog s veterinarian about sileo which is an anti anxiety drug for dogs you administer this medication between your dog s gums and cheek using a needleless syringe 8 x research source make the rooms your pets will be confined in feel familiar put down familiar clean bedding and something that smells of you such as a t shirt you ve worn give them their favorite chew toys scratch pads balls or other toys to keep your pets distracted 9 x research source ensure that the room temperature is comfortable make it warm in cold weather or cool in hot weather provide food and water for your pet be sure to leave sufficient water and food for your pet in the confinement space if your pet has access to water and its regular food it will be calmer consider buying a special treat such as wet food or small sausages to make it feel more comfortable during the fireworks chewing can help to relieve stress for dogs that like to chew make sure that your dog has an appropriate chew toy or bone if it likes to chew to calm itself move your pet to the prepared room if you re worried about not being able to find your pet consider looking for it a few hours before the fireworks are set to start mealtime is a good time to round up your pets if your dog needs a walk be sure to walk it before confining it in the room even if your pet is caged you should still keep it in the secure and comfortable room you ve selected if your pet is a horse or other farm animal make sure it has clean bedding and is safely inside the stable or barn prepare yourself mentally and try to relax it s possible to transfer some of your anxiety and worry to your pet so it s important to remain calm so you don t inadvertently stress your pet out if you ve prepared properly in advance there is no need to feel worried as you have done all you can to make the experience as easy as possible for it stay with your pet or at least check on it regularly comfort it and talk to it be friendly and stay happy and upbeat as pets can read emotions better than you think if it s not possible to stay with it you may be at the fireworks display yourself just make sure you do everything you can for its comfort while you are gone act how you normally would when you visit your pet treating it any differently than you normally do may make it feel more anxious allow your pet to hide somewhere in the room it s common for pets to cope with these experiences by using a bolthole and dragging it out of its safe space can make him much more anxious consider using lavender plants or spray for a calming scent gently bruise the flowers of fresh lavender and make sure that it s out of reach of your pet especially if you have a cat you should use a pheromone spray designed for cats and small rodents as these animals can be harmed by the strong fumes reassure your pet and make the home normal again be sure that the fireworks are over before you remove sound and light dampening blankets and curtains let your pet have a free run of the house to see how it behaves before letting it go back outside put your animal s cage back in its normal place and stay with them for a few hours to see how they are coping sometimes it is best to wait until the following morning to let your pet back outdoors do a yard sweep before letting your pets back outside collect any sparklers firecrackers and other party items and broken objects even if you did not host a party at your house it is still a good idea to check for litter that may have entered your yard from nearby celebrations 10 x research source check for signs of stress in your pet some pets will return to normal as soon as the loud noises and flashing lights stop but some may need special attention to feel safe again watch for irregular behaviour from your pet which could be a sign that it s having a hard time re adjusting in cats signs of stress include running away soiling the house hiding and refusing to eat in dogs signs of stress include anxious barking running away soiling the house cowering clinging to their owner whimpering trembling pacing and refusing to eat in small rodents signs of stress include hiding staying silent excessive tooth grinding and acting more aggressively than usual in horses and stable animals signs of stress include soiling themselves refusing to eat sweating and tooth grinding make your pet feel at home again and give it lots of attention after taking down blankets moving its cage back and making the home feel as it did before the fireworks you can make your pet feel much more comfortable and relaxed even if it was scared during the fireworks if it seems stressed be sure to give it lots of attention and reassure it through gentle grooming and talking in a soft voice,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to remove vocals from songs,want to make some karaoke tracks you can learn how to strip the vocal channel out of songs and leave the music while it s somewhat difficult to do this without muddying up the track there are a variety of tips and techniques you can try out to get the best quality audio possible,start with high quality audio tracks if you put low quality files into your editing software it s not going to sound good when you start trying to take stuff out it s important to start with wav or flac files and work from there the results will be a lot more clear than you ll get from a super compressed mp3 file locate the vocals in the mix stereo tracks all have two separate channels with the instruments and vocals spread across them bass guitar and other channels will typically be pushed to one side or the other while vocals are normally placed in the center channel this is done to make them sound centered to isolate them you ll split this center channel and invert one of them how can you tell where the vocals are just listen in good quality headphones if the vocals seem to be coming out of both channels simultaneously they re mixed in the center if not they re to the side that you hear the vocals coming from some styles of music and specific recordings will have different balances between channels if the vocals are shifted to one channel or the other instead of centered it s much easier to remove them songs with a lot of effects may be quite difficult to separate and invert there may be a little echo of the vocals that will be difficult to remove import the audio into the editing software of your choice you can do this basic process in any editing software that allows you to invert tracks for a particular channel while the exact location of the tool for each will vary slightly the basic process is the same for the following programs audacity pro tools ableton reason break the channels into separate tracks in most programs you can break a high quality sound file recorded in stereo into the two tracks you should see a black arrow next to the track title which you can click and select split stereo track you should then have the separate channels to work with individually 1 x research source select one of the channels to invert since they both have vocals embedded in the tracks select either one double click to select the entire track if you want to remove the vocals on the entire song invert the channel once you ve selected the track invert it using the effect function and selecting invert the song might sound a little strange after you play it after inverting the track should sound like it s coming from the sides instead of the middle you should still be able to hear vocals some but don t worry you ll complete the effect when you bounce it back to mono convert the file back to mono combine the two stereo channels back into one channel you should now have one combined track that should have a more diminished amplitude that means the vocals will be massaged out and the instrumentation will be usable you may still hear faint hints of the original singer hiding in the background choose vocal eliminator software vocal eliminator software packages are available on the internet for a variety of prices some vocal eliminator software packages may be downloaded for free but most are available only through a purchase 2 x research source each software package provides instructions for installation here s a little of different packages at a variety of prices vocal remover pro ipe myvoice karaoke roland r mix e media myvoice wavearts dialog install an audio equalizer software package audio equalizer software packages are not available for free download and must be purchased installation instructions will be provided with the package make sure that the audio eliminator is compatible with your operating system and the sound files you re using some audio equalizers include profound sound csharp equalizer apo graphic equalizer pro boom 2 open the song file and follow the instructions each software package works differently but will offer a tutorial specific to the software to help guide you through the process it s quite easy especially on software specifically made for helping you record karaoke tracks the software will execute the removal of the audio tracks automatically with an equalizer you ll usually just open the audio equalizer software and play the music file you want to edit the audio equalizer will remove of the audio tracks automatically adjust the audio equalizer to preserve the bass tones to make sure you don t lose the bass it s important to make a few adjustments set the signal attenuation for 5 db at 200 hz and below on both the left and right channels this will preserve the bass tones understand the concept of channel phase two sound waves moving up and down together are said to be in phase when one of the waves is moving up at the same time as the other wave moves down the waves are said to be out of phase out of phase waves cancel each other out resulting in a flat line of sound 3 x research source flipping the phase on one speaker will cancel the matching signal s waves in the other speaker 4 x research source the efficiency of this as a technique is pretty debatable it may theoretically work but it s not a way to save a song file without vocals find the wires leading into the back of one speaker each speaker usually has two wires going into it one with a positive lead and one with a negative lead usually these are red and white black and red or black and white sometimes they re black and black swap the two wires going into one speaker around where the black wire was connected connect the red wire and move the red wire to the black wire s terminal many modern stereo systems and head phones do not allow you to swap wires on the back of one speaker sometimes the wires are bundled into one wire sleeve the only way to swap the bundled wires is to splice them or re solder the connector use a digital phase processor there are special digital techniques using chips called digital signal processors to do the flipping of the wave inside the stereo or hi fi usually the button is a karaoke button which flips the one side of the stereo image phase if your stereo or app has one of these then just press it and the lead vocals will get very soft or disappear adjust the levels to accommodate for the loss of vocals background vocals are often mixed more to the left or right so these are hard to remove you will have to sing along with them and pretend they are your very own backing choir if you re trying to make a karaoke track flipping phase really affects bass waves so the bass might disappear along with the lead vocals digital dsp karaoke systems will fix this by flipping the phase on only the vocal frequencies try adjusting the levels on your stereo to get it to sound correct sophisticated vocal removal systems or software allow you to decide which frequencies get flipped out of phase,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to get good song ideas,sometimes it s tough to come up with good ideas for songs but don t get discouraged if you re running into trouble take some time to get your creative juices flowing open yourself to your emotions and look for inspiration in the world around you do writing exercises and play with melodies until you come up with lyrics and tunes that pique your interest keep exploring those ideas and refine them until you ve crafted a cohesive catchy song,visualize the message theme or moment that you want to capture if you want to write a song about a specific subject sit in a quiet place and clear your mind think about your subject matter or look at it if it s an object image or environment allow it to fill your emotions and try to put your experience into words 1 x research source suppose you just had a great first date and feel like writing a song about it clear your mind replay the night in your head and let your thoughts and feelings percolate don t filter your thoughts or try to force yourself to write down words just focus on putting yourself in the moment and letting it fuel your emotions if you get inspired and words do come to mind write them freely without making any edits allow your mind to wander while you re doing routine tasks let your creative juices flow when you re washing the dishes taking a shower driving or going for a walk think about a memory person or emotion or just clear your thoughts and be open to any ideas that float to the surface 2 x research source if an idea for a song melody or lyric comes to you write it down or record yourself using a cell phone app analyze other artist s lyrics and song structures read song lyrics from a variety of genres and time periods take note of how artists structured verses and choruses rhyme schemes and rhythmic patterns identify the tone notice devices like similes and metaphors and ask yourself who the artist s words are addressing 3 x research source look for similarities and differences across genres and periods use your insights to inform your own tastes set your musical goals and decide the type of song you want to write for instance contemporary pop tracks are typically catchy simple and make use of repetition many alternative hip hop lyrics are rhythmically and thematically complex while country lyrics often aim to tell a story with a clear beginning middle and end look for inspiration in music literature film and other art forms immerse yourself in a classic album riveting novel striking painting or brilliant film put yourself within the work of art s story or moment let it play out in your mind and trigger your emotions 4 x research source if you have a particular theme in mind look to works of art with similar tones for instance listening to love songs or watching a romantic drama can help you get inspired if you want to write a love song of your own draw pictures and imagine stories about your sketches if you think better in images than words make quick doodles or sketch a scene or feeling look back at your drawings and think about what s going on in the images in front of you 5 x research source even nonsense doodles can add colorful details to song lyrics suppose you drew a stick figure trying to balance an elephant piano and sofa on top of each other you could use that image as a metaphor or simile in a song about dealing with tons of pressure write freely for 15 to 30 minutes every day writing is like exercising your muscles so stick to a set routine without editing or filtering your thoughts write whatever comes to mind for 15 to 30 minutes a day don t worry if most of what you write is unusable now and then you might come up with a good line that you can keep exploring 6 x research source write edit lyrics and brainstorm music in a quiet place you won t be able to concentrate to the best of your ability if the television is on or there s lots of commotion around you keep a notepad on you and scribble notes throughout the day when you re out and about and think of an idea jot it down or record it on your phone even if you like to record yourself singing or speaking keep a pad and pen on you in case your device dies 7 x research source great ideas can come in the middle of the night when you re in a dreamy state so keep a pad on your nightstand even if it doesn t make much sense when you read it in the morning it may be the germ of a great theme tune or lyric find a good line in your notes and expand on it look through your daily pad or journal entries free writing notes and anything else you ve written depending on how much you write review your pages daily every few days or every week or so try to find a good line phrases or a paragraph then work on developing that idea 8 x research source you may write a week s worth of entries and find 1 or 2 lines that seem to click keep exploring that idea with both free writing and purposeful writing sessions try to come up with passages that further develop the idea keep in mind good songs are often conversational aim for simplicity especially when you re first coming up with lyrics you can worry about rhymes rhythms and colorful imagery later 9 x research source refine your passages into rhyming verses once you ve put together your raw lyrics work on tweaking their rhythm and setting up a rhyme scheme try using a rhyming dictionary to swap out words in your verses and create pleasing sounds 10 x research source keep in mind you shouldn t sacrifice meaning or emotional content just to make a rhyme additionally the rhyme scheme doesn t always have to be strict or perfect for instance take the lyric tell me something girl are you happy in this modern world girl and world don t rhyme perfectly but they share enough vowel and consonant sounds to please the ear play with tunes and chords on your instrument of choice start by playing simple chords on your piano guitar or whichever instrument you play if you have a specific theme or lyrics think about the tone your melody should convey if it s dark or sad you might want to stick to minor chords if it s happy and up tempo you might be better of with major chords 12 x research source don t worry if you don t play an instrument you can still come up with a catchy tune by humming or whistling then work with a friend or relative who plays an instrument to refine the tune and draft sheet music try coming up with a melody based on a lyric if you ve already written lyrics try singing the first line of a verse or chorus in an array of tunes and tempos play around with singing higher notes at different words to add emphasis keep experimenting until you find a memorable melody that captures the tone you re trying to achieve 13 x research source if you ve written lyrics ask a musical friend how they hear your words bounce ideas off of each other and sing the words in different improvised tunes 14 x research source build complementary tunes around your base melody for the verses craft a progression of tones or notes in standard patterns in a simple melody the first line often ascends the scale or rises in pitch then the second line descends in response 15 x research source sing the children s song twinkle twinkle little star how i wonder what you are notice how the first line s notes rise in pitch then the second goes lower the verses melody repeats itself but that doesn t mean it should be predictable or boring rhythm is key so experiment with combinations of quarter eighth and sixteenth notes to give your melody fresh catchy rhythmic accents create contrasting rhythms and tunes to give your song variety while a song s verses repeat a melody the chorus presents an opportunity to add contrast in many great songs the chorus surprises the listener with tunes and rhythms that leap out from the verses 16 x research source contrast is the key to the verse chorus relationship one musical passage repeated over and over isn t interesting so grab your listeners attention with rhythmically and melodically diverse sections,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to quote a book,when you re writing an essay using a quote can help validate your argument and make your writing stronger whether your paper is required to be in mla or apa format it s easy to quote and cite a book the right way,be clear why you are using a quotation a quotation should provide a new point of view or bolster a point you are trying to make elaborate on the quoted text provide context and explain why it supports your argument 1 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source quotations are often used to support ideas that might be disputed or are not common knowledge an idea like most people never live to see 100 doesn t need to be backed up by a quotation but something like many writers have described the power of fiction should probably be supported with quotations one can sometimes emphasize a particular point by backing it up with a quotation from a particularly impressive author quotations can also add stylistic flare to your prose for example a sentence like when shakespeare shuffled off this mortal coil he likely had no idea the impact his work would make on western culture is a bit more interesting than if the same sentence started simply when shakespeare died work them into your text so they read like normal sentences to do this you will usually use a signal phrase like according to the author or something to that effect thus nick caraway describes humans as boats against the current works while nick caraway has a sad view of people boats against the current does not 2 x research source if you are having trouble deciding if you ve incorporated a quotation correctly try reading it aloud to yourself it can be easier to tell if a sentence works when you speak it some examples of verbs used in signal phrases are claims adds writes argues asserts confirms points out admits concludes observes and implies 3 x research source use brackets and ellipses to add or subtract words sometimes a quotation will support your argument perfectly but be impossible to work into your text without making changes in such cases you will need to use brackets or ellipses 4 x research source insert new words into quotations by putting them inside brackets remove existing words by replacing them with an ellipsis note that this is only appropriate if you maintain the basic meaning of the quotation it should not be used to twist an author s words into something other than what she intended as an example one could change the nabokov quotation art not an escape which is only a cleaner cell on a quieter floor but relief from the itch of being into the sentence art is not an escape but relief from the itch of being insert short quotations into the body of the paragraph a quotation shorter than four lines of prose or three lines of verse does not need to be its own freestanding block of text it can simply be incorporated into the paragraph in which you are using it it should begin and end with double quotation marks 5 x research source make long quotations into freestanding blocks of text when quoting an excerpt longer than four lines of prose or three lines of verse start by writing a signal phrase introducing the quotation as you would with a shorter one begin the quotation on a new line below this 6 x research source indent the whole quotation one inch from the left double space it in an mla style research paper everything should be double spaced do not use quotation marks include an in text citation after the quotation the author s last name and the page on which the quotation can be found should be included in parenthesis at the end of the quotation before the next punctuation mark this is called a parenthetical citation and will help your reader locate the full citation in your bibliography or works cited page 7 x research source for example maybe the best definition of art is simply beauty plus pity nabokov 251 if you reference the author s name before the quotation you don t need to repeat it in the parenthesis following the quote for example nabokov defined art as beauty plus pity 251 make a works cited page this should begin on a separate page at the end of your research paper or essay label it works cited in centered non italic text without the quotation marks at the top of the page 8 x research source double space the page but do not skip spaces between citations do not indent the first line of each citation but indent all subsequent lines by 0 5 inches from the left put the full citation in your works cited page order your citations alphabetically by the authors last names the basic format of an mla style book citation is lastname firstname title of book city of publication publisher year of publication medium of publication 9 x research source there are many variations on this basic format based on factors like how many authors the book has and whether it is something like anthology an ebook or a self published book if the book you are quoting does not fit neatly into this formula consult a

12 x research source indent the whole quotation 1 2 inch from the left double space it in an apa style paper everything should be double spaced do not use quotation marks use a parenthetical citation you need to cite the author year of publication and page number preceded by p the best way to do this is to use a signal phrase with the author s name in it followed by the date of publication and the page number in parenthesis for example smith 2011 insists that quoting books is not difficult but it can take time to get the hang of p 15 13 x research source if the author s name is not included in the signal phrase include the author s last name the year of publication and the page number all separated by commas in the parenthetical citation following the quotation for example he insists that quoting books is not difficult but it can take time to get the hang of smith 2011 p 15 make a reference list this should begin on a separate page at the end of your research paper or essay label it references in centered text it should not be bold italicized underlined or in quotation marks at the top of the page 14 x research source double space the page like the rest of the paper but do not

is taking place explain whether the story is about you and or you and your relationship with someone else in your life for example in tony gervino s essay he sets the scene by providing setting character and narrative voice it was july 1973 we were living in scarsdale n y and he was four years older than i was although that seemed like decades move chronologically through the events do not jump to different moments in time or move from a past event to a present event and then back again in the same paragraph go chronologically from event to event or moment to moment this will make it easier for the reader to follow along with the narrative for example you may start with an event in childhood with your older sister and then move forward in time to the present day focusing on you

personal narrative about your complicated relationship with your troubled sister by ending on a recent memory where you both enjoyed each other s company you may leave the reader with a lesson you have learned about loving someone even with all their messiness and baggage read the narrative out loud once you have finished a draft of the personal narrative read it aloud to yourself listen to how the narrative sounds out loud notice if there are any awkward moments or unclear sentences circle or underline them so you can revise them later you can also try reading the narrative out loud to someone else so they can hear how it sounds this can then make it easier for them to give you feedback show the narrative to others ask a friend peer classmate or family member to read the narrative pose questions to them about the style tone and flow of the narrative ask them if the narrative feels personal detailed and engaging 6 x research source be willing to accept feedback from others be open to constructive criticism as it will likely strengthen the narrative revise the narrative for clarity and length read over the narrative for any spelling grammar or punctuation errors review the narrative to make sure it is not too long as personal narratives are usually short no more than one to five pages long you may also need to meet a specific length requirement if you are writing the personal narrative for a class,Arts-and-Entertainment

label for 21st century post avant jazzcore your focus and approach will be much different write a business plan this is needed on many levels first and foremost you will build the framework of your label how you plan on finding and developing talent your marketing and promotion avenues how you understand the market and the competition how you plan on financing your venture and how you intend on making this a profitable business if you re independently wealthy then you may not need investors at least for the monetary backing however you may wish to attract investors who can help you build credibility in your market for example if you started a pop music label with your own cash but were able to convince sir paul mccartney to invest in your label that would be a huge win for your label to do that though you will need a credible plan that shows sir paul or any other investor that you know what you are doing should you need financial backing having a plan that shows that you understand both the rewards and the risks and that you have been able to determine a way forward will go a long way in convincing an investor to risk his capital on your venture detail all the costs associated with your startup that will include everything from staples to electricity to recording and production costs be very thorough when you do this people who might consider becoming involved in your label will certainly be when they read your plan here are some things to take into account administrative costs rent utilities taxes and licenses are right up front and can be significant don t forget to include phone internet printers paper computers business cards and office supplies in this list you will also need a website as well as somebody to both create and maintain it some of these costs will be weekly some monthly and some that only happen every year or two it may seem like a lot at first but if you create a five year plan you should be able to chart out how these costs will eventually become a small percentage of the overall financial picture recording costs as a record label you re going to be producing acts that means you need to account for the recording chain including studio time the fees for the engineer and producer which may be you but you need to get paid too mixing engineers and studio musicians marketing budget a great recording is nothing until it s actually in the market to do that you re going to need to promote your label through online ads magazine ads press releases and your website you will also need to work with artists and designers to create your logo packaging standards and overall design plan professional services while you re busy making beautiful music somebody needs to take care of writing clear effective legal contracts both for your talent and for your business deals for that you will want the services of a qualified attorney who specializes in the music business you ll also want an accountant to make sure that you friendly tax collector doesn t come to call you need people that you can trust and rely on prepare a cash flow forecast planning a cash flow forecast for one three and five years out requires some skill some savvy and some educated guesswork the first year should be a very solid plan you will have a good idea of your startup costs already and you will likely have in mind and made contact with a few bands who will be the first on your roster using this information determine how much you ll be spending and a projection about how much these acts will bring in for example you can base this on how the bands are doing currently do they pack clubs their music has a good track record and will probably perform well if you also have bands that are brand new and don t have a fan base to work from you ll have to do significantly more promotion to get the word out as you add more bands to your roster your income potential will continue to grow as you plan for years three to five in your forecast you will need to determine how and when you will add more talent and how you will promote them this is where prediction gets a little more complicated a great band on your roster may make it much easier for you to promote all the bands on your roster similarly a poorly performing band will be a cash drain that can lead to financial struggles create your team unless you re supremely talented in sales marketing music business art conversation and moonlight as a lawyer you re going to want to develop a team here are some key skill sets that will enable your success marketing and sales somebody who can get out there and promote your label who knows the industry and has a personal relationship with artists promoters and people who like to support the arts financially this person or persons will be key to your success they re responsible for bringing talent in and getting the word out the better they perform the more successful you ll be production you ll need somebody who understands the recording process inside and out who can find or develop good engineers mixers and producers and who can run a recording session contract help to keep costs down at least at first consider hiring other staff on a per job basis this would include logo and graphic design legal accounting engineering and other needs that only occur from time to time formalize your business set up the appropriate business entity for your label so that you can operate legally and protect yourself as well you have several options which may be called different things in different countries but are functionally the same sole proprietorship this is the one where you do it all a sole proprietorship is easy to start easy to stop and easy to maintain you may have consultants or friends who help you out with the many things that need to be done but at the end of the day it s all yours that includes all the profits and all the liabilities it offers little incentive for investors very little protection for you and should your business fail any business debts will come out of your pocket if you are planning on making your label a real business or want to hire people as you grow this is not the best option limited liability corporation llc an llc is great for a small business you have the ability to add people to the team as you grow and it offers personal liability protection should the business fail it also provides for relatively easy and flexible control over finances legal and tax issues if you plan on seeking investors or are international in scope this is not a good option corporation you inc if you are planning to make this a major business venture are going to be seeking investors and who like a formal structure this is the way to go as with llcs you are protected from liability for business losses you can issue shares of stock raise investment capital and have decades of legal precedents to call on when necessary there are strict rules of organization and your accountant as well as your attorney will be kept busy with taxes fees reports and filings if you are the casual laid back type this is not the best option for you unless you are ready to pick up the pace bring in the talent with your plan in place your business in order licenses and permits applied for and granted and your production art created and approved and hopefully some investment capital to get you rolling it s time to get to work get out there and listen to live music but listen with a critical ear watch the audience and see how they react to the band if they are up on their feet from the start and swooning over the band you might be on to something approach the band and talk with them find out who they are how long they ve been together have they released any music and what their plans are for the future most importantly find out if they ve been signed to a label already that may not be a show stopper but for starting a record label you might want to pick a band that s not already signed meet the press your town is loaded with writers who will help you get the word out but they have to know you search for them in the local papers or local music blogs and make contact invite them to lunch or to your studio or to the studio you like to use and keep in touch with them meet the engineers find the local recording studios in your area and visit them some may be extravagant high end studios and many will be modest one or two room affairs with varying equipment standards while that is certainly something to consider more important is the quality of music that comes out of their speakers get to know the engineers and talk to them about their recording philosophy how they relate to bands and what irks them this is good to know if for example you have a rap artist you think will be a hit and the engineer absolutely hates rap ask them to play some of their favorite cuts and listen carefully to be really thorough ask them for a cd of some of their work so that you can also listen on your home speakers though it s rare what sounds mind blowing in a million dollar studio might sound like it was recorded in the back seat of a gremlin when taken out of the studio environment visit the music and record stores big or small they are there to sell recordings when you get to know them they may well be happy to sell your recordings as well it s a small venue in the grand scheme of things but when you re getting started there s no venue that s too small get to know the agents these are the people who have their fingers on the pulse of the local music industry the bands that have signed an agent have passed a certain threshold of legitimacy simply by being professional enough to hire an agent if your services show well to agents and promoters the next time one of their bands says hey name i think we re ready to record an album that person will say i know just the place establish your brand once you ve got the practical business matters well in hand cultivate and maintain the aesthetic layers of your record label create a logo and make sure you use your logo and look on your physical labels on your website and on all stationary t shirts mugs etc sign bands and acts that fit in with the particular image you hope to cultivate check out successful diy labels sub pop and matador records for examples of brand management who maintain a fiercely independent business model that s also quite diverse market your label creatively over the last ten years the internet has drastically changed the way music is purchased listened to and distributed you may face a hard road to success if you re using the traditional model of touring and relying on cd sales and radio play youtube videos and pay what you want models are increasingly popular in maintaining the success of your brand consider promotional gimmicks like printing t shirts with the download code for a label mixtape on the tag goner records a memphis based garage punk label even offered free 7 inch records to anyone who got goner tattooed to their body and showed it at the store grow your base sub pop started by focusing on local pacific northwest grunge bands but now features a diverse array of more mainstream sounds like iron wine and fleet foxes with this expansion of the kinds of sounds they embrace their success and share of the market has grown considerably even if you re focusing right now on tween pop stars consider taking ways in which you might crossover and fit other sounds and images into your brand in the early 90 s major labels were much more willing to take risks on unknown or underground acts sonic youth a noisy independent art band from new york found themselves in a unique position after being offered a big deal by geffen and the signing was applauded by both label executives and music fans if your label is bringing in money consider throwing a curveball by releasing a project from left field,Arts-and-Entertainment

original an rp based on a completely original setting that the roleplayers make up it can be anything fantasy historical real life etc group an rp between a group of three or more people they can be fast paced one on one an rp between two people it is often written as 1x1 and may contain 1 to 2 pairings create your character if needed if you are playing a canon character then you will not need to create a character for the rp you should be prepared to portray the canon character as accurately as possible however when creating an original character you will need to make them believable if you are in a group rp you may need to submit them to the creator for approval consider the following when creating your character physical appearance describe your character s hair eye skin color and whatever else is most important to you this will help other writers to visualize your character you can also use an image instead if permitted personality what is your character like and how do they act around other characters you should also think about your character s goals motives and desires likes and dislikes what sorts of things does your character like and dislike fear it could be as simple as a love for chocolate and a fear of spiders it could be as complex as having a hobby ie painting and having a fear ie being abandoned skills and talents everyone is good at something and your character should too it might be a good idea to include something your character is bad at in order to make them more believable backstory this will root your character in the fictional world you will need to consider your character s history family life occupation and so forth make your character believable and realistic in the rp world flawless characters called mary sues or gary stues have a notorious reputation and are extremely frowned upon create a character with both positive and negative traits for example your character is smart but too shy to speak up in class and show off her intelligence add a fun quirk or two characters that have unusual approaches to solving problems odd habits or strange mannerisms can make your character compelling and interesting to others if you are creating a character for a fandom rp try to blend them into the fandom s world as much as possible don t make them too similar to an existing character however choose between a narrative and script style some roleplayers prefer to write using a narrative style which reads like a typical book it is the most popular style others prefer a screenplay style which reads like a script it is most suitable for fast paced roleplays here s an example of what a screenplay style roleplay might look like fanfiction4ever jane running breathlessly through the rain roleplay_queen john hey jane wait up runs over and pulls out umbrella here open umbrella let s walk to class together fanfiction4ever jane blushes and gets under the umbrella o okay use concrete details and ample description while writing this will immerse yourself and fellow roleplayers in the fictional world at the same time you ll want to avoid rambling as this can make the other person lose interest use the five senses sight touch smell hearing and taste describe the setting weather temperature location and important surrounding objects use gestures what are your characters doing thinking how do they walk talk and position themselves contribute to the plot this is especially important when doubling don t expect your partner to do all the work don t just respond to everything he or she writes add something new to your posts as well if your partner is doing all the work eventually he or she will run out of ideas and get tired or drained rps where two people are contributing to the plot are more interesting than rps where one person is doing all the work read what other people write wait your turn and post a replay in text based roleplaying everyone writes out what their character says thinks and does and posts it usually in a forum if you are doing a one on one roleplay this may be in an instant messenger or even email when your turn comes post your character s part of the story post as soon as you can if you are unable to post in a timely manner let your roleplay partner or the group leader know do not pester people for replies this can be seen as annoying wait a week before asking for a reply sometimes people forget or get busy don t ditch a roleplay without a word this can be seen as very rude in the roleplay community if you get tired of the roleplay and don t want to do it anymore be upfront about it politely tell the person you are roleplaying with that you are no longer interested know what doubling is doubling occurs in one on one roleplays where there are two pairings your pairing and your partner s pairing these pairings are often romantic each person plays their desired character and a character of their partner s choosing for example if you were doing an avenger s rp the pairings might be steve rogers x your oc and tony stark x your partner s oc in this case you d be playing your oc and tony stark your partner would be playing their oc and steve rogers here is an example of what doubling might look like roleplay_queen john grinned as jane slipped her arm through his and began to lead her to class hey jane he said at last i was wondering if you wanted to come to homecoming this weekend with me his heart pounded in his chest as he waited for her reply meanwhile mary was hurrying through the halls trying to get to her class she was running late again but wasn t her fault elizabeth and her gang had stolen her bag earlier that morning she got to class moments before the first bell and sat down fanfiction4ever jane s eyes widened at john s invitation and she could hardly believe what she was hearing this was practically a dream come true oh john she said i would love to and here she thought that john never liked her chris was already sitting at his desk when he saw mary enter the classroom he waved her over and held up her book bag he had seen what happened earlier and managed to get it back from elizabeth here he said softly and gave it to her maintain good etiquette when doubling when to roleplaying fair is fair you should give the same amount of attention to both characters that you are playing your character and the character you are playing for your partner if you write two paragraphs for your original character you should write two paragraphs for the other character you are playing ie tony stark if you only write two sentences for that other character you would not be fair to your partner just imagine if you only got two sentences back for steve rogers choose live action roleplaying if you like to act or play fight many people like to compare live action roleplaying to playing pretend that is you hang out with other people and pretend that you are someone else such as a vampire or a pirate find a type of live action roleplay that interests you some live action roleplays are action based where you fight opponents with boffers weapons made from foam others are story based where you do not touch the other characters instead you decide whether you win or lose a battle by rolling dice playing rock paper scissors or comparing character stats story based live action roleplays are also called theater style or freeform some live action meet regularly in a public area while others meet seldom ie once a month or once a year in a staged area such as a campground or hotel understand the terminology when you first enter the world of larping you may hear certain terms that are completely new to you most of them are pretty self explanatory but some might be confusing different groups might have different terms for certain things but the following are the most common larp stands for live action roleplay boffer a foam padded weapon commonly used in action based larps game master the person in charge of leading the larp s story he or she will be in charge of bringing in new characters dilemmas etc they may also be called a storyteller and are common in story based larps npc stands for non player character they are unavailable to the other players and are usually played by the game master pc stands for player character this is the character that you the larper plays crew also called stagehands they help the game master setup the event some may also play npcs review the gaming rules they will vary depending on which group you join for example action based larps often have rules against where you can or can t hit a person with a boffer ie the head story based larps on the other hand often have no touching rules breaking these rules may result in disciplinary action such as a temporary ban or point deduction many larps require you to be in character you have to indicate when you are not in character how you do this may vary from group to group create your character and make sure that they fit the larp s world some types of larps may have a character sheet for you to fill out complete with stats like strength luck agility intelligence etc other types of larps only require a name and a brief backstory for your character some larps require costumes when creating a character you might want to keep this in mind especially if you plan on making the costume yourself get a costume if needed some larps require you to be in costume at all times while others do not in either case the costume will help make your character more believable and the world more engaging many people find it easier to get into character while they are in costume many action based larps only require costumes for the actual game or battles they do not require costumes during training sessions stay in character whenever possible typically you would be in character when the larp is taking place you would be out of character before and after the larp such as when plans are being made and points are being tallied if you need to get out of character such as during an emergency remember to indicate accordingly again how you indicate will depend on the group you join as they all have different rules find a place to roleplay or a group to play with most larps will have websites telling you where their roleplays take place many larps have multiple groups in multiple locations all playing the same game that is they use the same character types and rules if you find a larp that interests you look it up and see if it is playing near your city or town if they don t then see if you can register a group of your own and start your own game some larps take place at anime comic book or science fiction and fantasy conventions check the schedule to see if there is one planned most cons will post their schedules ahead of time on their website be well prepared for longer roleplay sessions some larps take place in public areas such as a park and last only a few hours others may span over the course of a weekend and take place at a campground forest or lake some of these longer larps may have accommodation for the players such as cottages or hotels but others won t in these cases you will need to pack for the trip and bring items such as tents sleeping bags food medications change of clothes etc a costume and prop repair kit would be highly recommended for any weekend long larp session even the sturdiest costumes and props break and not every place will have a repair station don t be afraid to interact with other people but don t take the spotlight either larping is all about interaction once a session starts you will walk around and talk with other players while in character this means that if you are playing a 100 year old vampire you will be using lots of victorian era mannerisms don t be afraid to go out of your shell but don t take the spotlight and try to be the center of attention let other players talk as well if this is a combat based larp have your boffer ready because people might start charging at you there is not much chatting or acting in combat based larps once a battle starts there is no real winner or loser in a story based larp but the last one standing is the winner in a combat based larp play hard choose tabletop roleplaying if you like video games or storytelling many tabletop games focus on the story but they also focus on building your character you will typically sit around a table with a group of people and take turns describing what your character does one of the most popular tabletop roleplay games is dungeons and dragons find a game that you want to play typically you can find a game to join online or in your local gaming hobby shop some games require you to be there in person while others can be played online there are lots of different settings and genres ranging from fantasy to science fiction to historical to horror some may have other themes too such as steampunk or western there are lots of game guides and rule books available online in bookstores and at libraries you can always pick one of these up and start a game with your friends choose a play style that suits you your personality and your lifestyle some group meet regularly while others meet occasionally this can be as often as once a week to a seldom as once a month or only a few times a year also some games are lighthearted and easy going while others are very serious and focused if you are just starting out a lighthearted easy going play style might be the best for you if you are very busy with work and or school a group that meets weekly night be too much for you but a group that meets monthly might be perfect choose a roleplay whose focus appeals to you some roleplays will focus more on story or setting while others will focus more on battle and combat if you are a very active person a story focused roleplay might bore you on the other hand if you enjoy a good story a combat focused roleplay might not be engaging enough for you there are three main types of roleplays game oriented roleplays focus on leveling characters via challenges the battles and monsters become more complex as the characters gain more power simulation oriented roleplays focus on exploring the setting genre or theme combat tends to be dangerous in these games narrative oriented games focus on how a character s decision affects the story these games tend to give players more control over setting and story understand the terminology every tabletop roleplay will have its own unique set of terms but there are some terms that remain consistent across all the different games and genres the most common ones are game master the in charge of the roleplay they are the narrator and lead the story game master may also be written as gm or gamemaster game mechanics the rules of the roleplay adventure the game but limited to a single story or plot set by the gm campaign a series of adventures it typically follows or continues the story and includes the same characters from previous sessions create your character how detailed your character is will depend on what game you are playing some games will give you complete freedom during character creation while others will require you to add stats some games will also limit what stats you can use based on what class or race you pick for your character depending on the game you play you may have to use the 20 sided die to determine your character s stats understand the basics after you have created your character the gm will establish the plot and setting the players will then take turns describing their characters actions and the gm will then decide on the consequences of those actions sometimes a 20 sided die will be used to determine the outcome for example if your character comes across a treasure chest the gm may have you roll the die to determine whether or not your character succeeds in opening the chest be descriptive but only to a certain point for the most part you will be in charge of describing your character s actions and the gm will be in charge of describing the results of your character s actions he or she will also be in charge of describing any scene changes for example if your character enters a dungeon the gm may describe the dungeon he or she may even throw in a monster for your character to battle,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to critique artwork,an art critique is a detailed analysis and evaluation of a work of art while no two people will experience the same reaction to a work of art or interpret it the same way there are a few basic guidelines you can follow to achieve a thoughtful thorough critique the basic elements of an art critique are description analysis interpretation and judgment,gather basic information about the work this is the sort of thing you d find on a museum or gallery label or in the caption in an art book knowing the background of a piece can make a big difference in how you interpret and understand it start your critique by providing the following information title of the work artist s name when the piece was created where it was made the types of media used to create the work e g oil paint on canvas the exact size of the work describe what you see using neutral terms describe the artwork your description should include things like the form and scale of the work if the art depicts figures or objects rather than abstract shapes describe what is represented 1 x research source for example you might say this is a small scale portrait painting of a young woman shown from the mid torso up against a dark background she is clasping her hands in front of her chest and looking up and slightly to the viewer s right she wears a pink dress and a long veil that falls behind her head avoid using terms like beautiful ugly good or bad at this point you re just talking about what you see not judging the art discuss the elements of the work now describe the work in more detail talk about the way the art uses these five basic elements of art and design line color space light and shape 2 x research source describe the use of line lines in a work of art can be either literal or implied different types of lines can create different moods or effects for example 3 x research source curved lines can create a calming effect while jagged lines might feel harsher and wild or create a sense of energy rough sketchy lines create a sense of movement and freedom while smooth solid lines feel more still and carefully planned a line of sight or action might be suggested by the arrangement of figures and objects within a scene for example a group of figures all looking or pointing the same way can create an implied line that draws your eye through the work in a particular direction talk about how color is used in the work make note of characteristics like hue red green blue etc value lightness or darkness and intensity look at overall color schemes and think about how the colors work together 4 x research source for example do the colors clash or are they harmonious does the work use a variety of colors or is it monochromatic all shades of blue for example describe the use of space in the work space refers to the areas around and between objects in a work when talking about space focus on things like depth and perspective overlapping of objects and the use of empty space versus space crowded with details 5 x research source if you are describing a two dimensional work of art like a painting talk about whether or not the work creates the illusion of three dimensional space and depth describe the use of light in the work light in a work of art can look warm or cool bright or dim natural or artificial take a little time to talk about the role of light and shadow in the work 6 x research source if you re talking about a two dimensional work like a painting your focus might be on how the artist creates the illusion of light for a three dimensional work like a sculpture you could discuss how actual light interacts with the work for example is the surface reflective does the sculpture cast interesting shadows are some parts of the sculpture more shadowed or well lit than others make note of the way shape is used in the work are the shapes in the work geometric with straight lines and perfect curves or are they more natural is the work dominated by any one particular type of shape or do you see a variety of different shapes 7 x research source shapes play an important role in both abstract and representative works for instance in a portrait of a bride by james sant there are notable triangle shapes made by the drape of the bride s veil around her shoulders and the clasped hands in front of her chest once you notice one shape in a painting look to see if it is repeated anywhere else discuss how the work uses the principles of composition once you have described the work it s time to analyze it or discuss how it all comes together start by talking about how the work is composed keeping a few basic ideas in mind for example 8 x research source balance how do the colors shapes and textures in the piece work together do they create a balanced or harmonious effect or is the piece imbalanced in some way contrast does the work make use of contrasting colors textures or lighting contrast can also be found in the use of different shapes or contours like jagged versus curved lines or geometric versus natural shapes movement how does the work create a sense of movement is your eye drawn through the composition in a particular way proportion do the sizes of the different elements in the work appear the way you would expect or are they surprising for example if the work shows a group of people do any of the figures look larger or smaller than they would in real life identify the point s of focus of the work most works of art have one or more points that are designed catch your attention and draw your eye in a portrait this may be the face or eyes of the subject in a still life it could be a centrally placed or well lit object try to identify which parts of the work are emphasized 9 x research source look at the work and make note of which feature s jump out at you right away or keep drawing your eye back to them ask yourself why your eye is attracted to the feature s in question for example if you find yourself fixating on one figure in a group is it because that figure is larger than the others are they closer to the viewer more brightly lit look for themes in the work identify a few key themes and discuss how the artist used the elements of design color light space shape and line to express these themes themes might include things like 10 x research source the use of a color scheme to give the work a particular mood or meaning see for example the paintings of picasso s blue period 11 x research source symbolism and religious or mythological imagery for example look at the use of figures and symbols from classical mythology in renaissance works like botticelli s birth of venus 12 x research source repeating images or motifs within a work or group of works for a good example of this look at how plants and flowers are used in many of the paintings of frida kahlo 13 x research source try to identify the purpose of the work in other words what do you think the artist was trying to say with the work why did they create the work try to summarize the overall meaning of the work as you see it describe your own reaction to the work now it s time to get a little more subjective think about how you feel while looking at the work what do you think is the overall mood of the work does it remind you of anything ideas experiences other works of art 14 x research source use expressive language to talk about your reaction to the work for example is the mood of the work sad hopeful peaceful would you describe the work as beautiful or ugly back up your interpretation with examples use examples from your description and analysis of the work to explain why you think and feel the way you do about the piece for example i believe that james sant s portrait of a young bride is intended to give a sense of the bride s spiritual devotion this is indicated by the line of the composition which draws the viewer s eye upward following the upward gaze of the subject it is also suggested by warm light coming from a source somewhere above the young woman decide whether you think the work is successful or not your goal here isn t necessarily to decide whether the art is good or bad instead focus on whether you think the work is successful for example think about the following do you think the work says what the artist wanted it to say did the artist use their tools and techniques well is the art original or does it imitate other works explain how you are judging the work once you have decided on a few aspects of the work to judge clearly state the focus of your evaluation for example you might say that you are judging the piece on how well organized it is how well done it is technically and how successfully it portrays the intended mood or themes summarize why you think the work is successful or unsuccessful in a few sentences explain your judgment of the work give specific reasons for your judgment using your interpretation and analysis of the work for example i believe this work is successful because the use of light shape gesture and line all work together harmoniously to portray the mood of the subject,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to make an art portfolio,looking to showcase your work to an art gallery to a university or for an employer an art portfolio is a great way to highlight all of your best pieces and show your abilities a portfolio should speak for itself and combine professionalism passion personality and a variety of pieces that have been inspired by you it will be your first impression and needs to stand out amongst other submitted portfolios in your portfolio you want to show whoever you are catering to your talent what makes you stand out from the rest and why they should choose your portfolio over someone else s,look up the requirements for your portfolio every organization is different and so they may require different things within your portfolio or a different format for your portfolio your portfolio will also depend greatly on the type of study or career you are interested in pursuing 1 x research source for example if you are applying to a film school or animation school your portfolio will likely be digital and consist mostly of work that you have done within that field on the other hand if you are applying to an architecture school or to an art gallery you may have more sketches and drawings some institutions suggest only using about 10 to 20 pieces in your portfolio if you have really strong pieces fewer is better because the more pieces you have the more likely it is that the quality of the pieces will drop 2 x research source always check what the organization expects before you begin piecing together your portfolio you don t want to waste time creating a portfolio one way and then have to redo it because it s not in the right format choose finished or unfinished pieces based on the requirements for your portfolio many schools in the united states require that all of your work be finished but some in other areas such as the united kingdom want to see your process and development check the requirements for your portfolio before you do one or the other if you are allowed to use unfinished pieces do so this reveals your skills commitment and depth of knowledge as well as gives context to the creation and thought process behind your work a piece of art is often more than just the finished product but greatly depends upon the process and experimentation of the piece 3 x research source make sure all pieces both finished and unfinished are perfected remove any smudges fingerprints or defects that have been left on the piece include observational drawings these pieces prove that you are able to observe something in real life and create your own replica of it on paper observational drawings or paintings can make up a substantial part of your portfolio the purpose of these drawings is to show those looking at your portfolio that you are able to record shape and form detail perspective proportion and surface qualities 4 x research source when drawing something from observation aim for a sense of realism without creating a rigid mechanical copy of it it may help to select a subject that s important to you because you ll begin to think about the themes and motifs behind the drawings rather than what s right in front of you highlight your best pieces if you have been an artist for awhile you likely have an array of pieces from the best to really good to mediocre to poor it may be tempting to choose your really good work along with your best work however these two need to be separated you don t want to just showcase your really good work you want to showcase only your best the pieces that you are certain without a doubt show quality ability artistry and creativity be selective with your work and don t choose pieces just for the sake of variety it s better to have solid pieces of art that vary less in medium or style than it is to have a lot of different mediums and styles but mediocre art 5 x research source if it s difficult to be unbiased or edit your own work ask a friend or two what pieces are your best pieces it could also be helpful to find a mentor in your own field look for someone with artistic talent who has been in your shoes before who can help you make difficult decisions like these and the good thing is you know you can trust their judgement because they have experience in artistry as well never choose art that is an imitation of someone else s art admissions offices and employers have seen thousands of portfolios and will likely be able to recognize if you have created artwork from a photograph or another piece of art this also reveals your lack of creativity and inability to create art from real life 6 x research source ask a friend to look over your art after you have picked out a significant body of work have a friend or mentors look over it asking them to give feedback on the different pieces you have picked out some of your art may need to be redone or improved so give yourself enough time before the portfolio needs to be submitted to improve your artwork build in time after you ve chosen your pieces to reflect and come back to those pieces once you ve been able to process it s important to give yourself this time because you will be able to better evaluate your work and will come back to it with less bias sometimes friends can be biased towards your work as well so it may be more beneficial to bring in someone that doesn t have a personal relationship with you it may be easier to receive constructive criticism from them as well learn to take constructive criticism well and know that it s not an insult or derogatory comment but given so that you can improve as an artist include supplemental articles publications or awards some institutions will not ask for this so once again check the requirements for your portfolio however this can be helpful to show that your work has been recognized by others and that it has has previous exposure use other portfolios as examples the best way to begin a project like a portfolio is to find other successful portfolios online and use those as your guide this doesn t mean copy the format or follow the portfolio piece by piece but it means to use it as a reference as you being making yours note how the artist organized his or her pieces pay attention to the style and design of the portfolio are your eyes drawn more to the design of the portfolio or are you drawn to the art 7 x research source if it feels intimidating or daunting to look at other portfolios remember that only the best work is what is displayed art is made up of technical skill as well as creativity so even if your technical skill isn t as advanced as those you see your creativity can make up for it tailor your portfolio to the institution a university and an art gallery may have very different ideas about what they would like to see in your portfolio or the design of your portfolio it s important that as you begin assembling and organizing your portfolio that you keep the audience in mind for example if submitting your work to an art gallery visit the gallery and make sure your work will fit in well in the gallery choose pieces design and organization of your portfolio that show you are familiar with the gallery and are aware of the art they carry if applying to a university or job always look up the requirements for the portfolio but tailor your portfolio to the type of institution as well you may be applying to a more prestigious art university that values technique and style or maybe you are applying to a school that places a higher emphasis and creativity and experimentation keep these things in mind as you design and organize your portfolio organize your portfolio group pieces by style subject media technique etc you want to make it as easy as possible for your reviewer to find the important information or to determine if you are a good fit for their institution by organizing your pieces you will give your reviewer an easy path to follow you want your portfolio to tell a story group by medium it s valuable to use different types of mediums in your portfolio to show you are well rounded and capable of doing different art forms it can be helpful to group these mediums together so that your portfolio clearly shows your different abilities and how you ve used each medium in your art for example you might group pastel art together and then group charcoal drawings and pencil drawings together and then you might group paintings together group by subject another way to group your artwork is by subject which will likely combine different mediums but will show your ability to accurately depict different things for example you may group by figure drawings drawings of landscape abstract art etc group by technique this is similar to grouping by medium but instead you are focusing on your range of abilities to use not just paper but digital media photography web design animation etc use a scrapbook or portfolio binder found at any art or craft store to organize and present your artwork keep it simple as an artist you may be tempted to have a really extravagant creative portfolio while it s great if your pieces are this way the portfolio that holds and displays your pieces should be professional organized and simple the purpose of this is because you don t want a very busy portfolio to distract your viewer from the artwork you want the focus to be on your artwork because that s what you are really trying to showcase space out your portfolio don t have too many pieces on one page and don t go overboard with the information you include stand out but don t be overzealous with an industry that is so competitive it s important for your work to stand out you don t want to be grouped in with the hundreds of people who have also submitted their portfolio so try to create a portfolio that highlights your pieces so well in a creative way that the reviewers can t help but notice be careful about overdoing it though if your attempts to stand out lead you to creating something corny or trying to be humorous but failing you may go unnoticed or be noticed but in a negative way the benefit of a portfolio is that you aren t just a name on a piece of paper like a resume your work really speaks to who you are and it is easier for an employer to grow attached to the creative impressions in your portfolio than a written set of job skills don t overthink your portfolio once you have completed it have a mentor give you feedback go over it a few times to make sure it is organized well and clear of any mistakes and then leave it by continually trying to edit and improve your portfolio you run the risk of changing it to make it stand out that may lead to a decrease in the professionalism of your portfolio create a virtual portfolio while it s handy to have your portfolio in a hard copy having a virtual copy of your portfolio will be helpful when submitting your portfolio online which is likely what you ll have to do for most applications photograph or scan your artwork after you have chosen the pieces for your portfolio use a good quality camera to take pictures of your art or ask a professional to take the pictures make sure the pictures are clear and high quality so that when viewed online the resolution is good choose a setting with excellent lighting and no glare and never use a flash when scanning artwork make sure there are no wrinkles on the page and that it lies flat on the scanner so the picture comes out exactly like the hard copy input these pictures into indesign or another program that allows you to create a clean cut portfolio that is easy to continually edit this not only provides you with a digital copy to use online but also serves as a backup in case your hard copy is lost or destroyed practice presenting your portfolio if you have the opportunity to show your portfolio in person it s important to practice going through it knowing what you will say for each piece and how you can effectively communicate why you think your work stands out and is valuable once you ve practiced it on your own a few times present it to a friend or mentor who can give you feedback on your presentation and how you are communicating your art once again your art should speak for itself when presenting a portfolio you shouldn t have to go in depth on every piece to explain it it should explain itself for the most part however there may be pieces that were inspired by an event in your life or mean something to you use those as an opportunity to show your creativity and passion behind your work gain feedback once you have completed your portfolio ask a mentor or friend to look over your completed portfolio making notes on the organization themes format and final work you have chosen you can also attend a portfolio review there are national portfolio days in which college admissions counselors will come to high schools and college campus events to review students artwork seek feedback on how you can improve your portfolio and use this as a trial run to prepare you for officially presenting your portfolio little details matter too if you have text in your portfolio always check for grammar mistakes it can be easy to focus on just the art but employers and admissions counselors want to see that you have reviewed all of your work and that you take this submission seriously you don t want to spend all your time making a fantastic portfolio that an employer or admissions counselor loves and then lose all chance of being chosen because you misspelled the name of the institution or used incorrect grammar update your portfolio on a regular basis even if you have already submitted your portfolio to several institutions always be ready to update and revise your portfolio with new and better work save time doing this as you go so that you won t have to do a major project of revision the next time you submit your portfolio this will keep your work relevant and up to date with your abilities and

how to tell a story,whether you re telling a joke telling a fairy tale or trying to persuade someone with a little empirical evidence telling a story well is an important skill while it comes naturally to some for others this skill is a learned one never fear you can learn to tell a better more engaging story with wikihow as your guide just get started with step 1 below,engage your audience start your storytelling by interacting with your audience or doing something to grab their attention ask them a question even if it s just rhetorical that relates to the conclusion twist or context for the story you re going to tell alternatively you can make a grabbing statement that catches their attention setting your hook the equivalent of a click bait headline this forces their attention to focus on the idea of your story and makes them want to hear more fairy tale example have you ever wondered why the moth chases the flame funny story example i have the college roommate story to end all college roommate stories let s just say it involves a toilet build the scene throughout your storytelling you want to create an immersive experience you want to tell your audience the story in a way that makes them feel like they re there start by giving them context when you start your story continue to create the scene by using details which help them picture the action and feel the things you felt you ll also want to carefully tailor your language use words which create very strong very specific emotions 1 x research source fairy tale example once upon a time when the world was old and magic still lived and beasts still spoke funny story example i m sort of the quiet owns multiple cats type right but my roommate was very much the what s a liver partier build tension and release tension of course the entire arc of a story should be building tension and releasing tension until the climactic point in the story and the falling action of the conclusion but what you need to remember is that a release of tension should come between the tension points without this release of tension a story can feel rushed or too list like real life includes moments between the things that happen to us stories should too this release can be a description of the scene and quick filling in of semi relevant details or a joke if the story is meant to be a bit funny 2 x research source fairytale example moth approached the tall white pillar and there was flame burning in her glory moth felt hooked somewhere around his stomach and the tug of love set in of course heroes do not rescue their princesses in the same day and moth spent many splendid moonlit nights falling deeper in love with flame funny story example it was a new year and so we moved into this new neighborhood that was nice and stabby so i m pretty much set to defcon 1 at all times good for the blood pressure you know focus on what s important when telling a story it is important to include details to create that sense of immersion however you don t want the story to take on a rambling feel this is why it s very important to focus on what s important cut the details that aren t important for the story leave the ones that make the story 3 x research source as time allows keep the details that go the furthest to create proper pacing or set the scene but adjust as necessary to meet the reactions of your audience if they start to seem bored speed it up and pare down to the necessities keep the flow logical this is where knowing your story and practicing become important you know that person that tells a story and they get partway in and then they re like oh i forgot to mention yeah don t be that guy don t stop to back up this breaks the listener s experience of the story tell the story in a way that is logical and flows smoothly if you do forget a detail weave it back in without breaking the experience of the story for example now the pied piper wasn t just after the town s money for no reason you see they d gone back on a deal they d made with him make it feel conclusive it s awkward when an audience isn t sure if you re done or not so make the conclusion of your story feel conclusive there are a number of ways to do this some examples of which are ask a question and give an answer how crazy is that i know i m sure not going to try that again state the moral this ladies and gentlemen is an excellent example of why you should never take your cat to work use tone and voice carefully try generally building in volume and speed until the climax of the story at which point you should slow back down and lower your voice to show you are done create character make the different people in the story feel different if you act them differently then you can skip the annoying blank said parts of the story you can also make the story feel more immersive play with accents speech patterns and voices for different people in the story you can add great comedic value by being silly or stereotyping with the voices 4 x research source for example characterize your father s voice with an overly deep gruff sound and add in occasional extras to the dialogue like relevant part of the story also i am going out to the garage to build a deck or part of a deck maybe i will just watch a television series where they build a deck make your storytelling big or small match the way your voice sounds to how you want the story to feel at that point change your pitch tone and volume to make stories seem calm or exciting depending on where you are in the story accelerate your speed and slightly increase volume as you build toward the conclusion slow down when you say the conclusion you should also experiment with dramatic pauses a moment of silence and a look can add a lot to someone s experience of a story control your face if you want to really become a great storyteller you have to master your ability to create and change facial expressions to match what you re saying your face should be able to basically act out the entire story if you really want to learn from the master watch a lot of youtube videos of john stewart or martin freeman remember facial expressions come in more than 3 flavors you can convey really complex emotions by using very specific facial expressions talk with your hands talking with your hands can make you go from seeming like a really stiff boring story teller to someone who commands the room with a story hands convey emotions hands keep our audience focused hands create a feeling of action if you don t use your body in any other way at least start talking with your hands when you tell a story of course you do not want to go over the top do not hit anyone in the face or knock over your drink or knock your drink into your face act out the story if you can move your whole body to act out the story you don t have to reenact every motion but use your body at key points in the story to direct the listener s attention to that point you can also use this to great comedic effect of course some stock gestures such as the groucho marx eyebrow lift or the rodney dangerfield collar tug can add extra silliness to a story conan o brien and robin williams frequently used stock gestures practice practice telling a story a few times before you tell it to other people then practice the story with a few people that don t matter much before telling it to anyone important you want to be comfortable telling the story and get a good feel for when to add in dramatic pauses and when to engage that big building tone of excitement memorize your story make sure you know the story backwards and forwards and then focus when you re telling it this is to help keep you from missing details that are important it also helps keep the story consistent across tellings which is important if someone is likely to hear the story more than once 5 x research source be authentic don t turn your stories into fish stories you know the ones where each time you tell it it gets more dramatic and more epic and the details change to become more mythic and characters become less and less real listeners tune out when they hear you tell a story like this reel that fish back in and keep your story feeling authentic if you want people to enjoy it control the environment you want to tell your story and a good place and time if you can even the best story can be ruined if you have to stop constantly because of distractions make sure the environment isn t too distracting or noisy if someone tries to steal the focus of attention direct it right back to you allow for interaction a listener s experience of a story gets even better if they are able to interact and join in the experience you can ask your audience questions or find other ways for them to interact with the story if you really want to step up your storytelling respond to your audience the most important skill to work on is being able to respond to your audience if they start to get bored wrap or step it up if they re really enjoying a particular part build on that if they re laughing give them room to laugh it s tricky but telling your story around the experience of your audience will make you a storyteller that no one will soon forget,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to reduce guitar string noise,guitar string noise can occur when changing chords or fingering on an acoustic guitar or when doing various effects on an electric guitar typically you can reduce or even eliminate unwanted string noise simply by changing your fretting technique it can take some practice to get it right especially if you ve been playing for a while and have developed some fretting habits that are less than ideal but with patience you ll get there if you still get unwanted noise you might want to experiment with different strings or accessories that are designed to reduce this noise,slow your playing and listen for squeaks take a song you re really familiar with and slow down the tempo use a metronome to help you keep time as you play listen for spots where you squeak then you can figure out how you re moving your fretting hand or what you re doing wrong 1 x research source for example it may be that you only squeak when transitioning between particular chords if you know which chord transitions are difficult for your hand you ll have a better idea of what you need to do to improve your technique if you video yourself playing with the camera focused on your fretting hand you can more easily pinpoint the areas where squeak is occurring and what your hand is doing to cause it release the pressure on the string after you play the note immediately after you ve played the note stop pressing down with your finger on the string instead let it rest lightly in position on top of the string you might also transition from the tip of your finger to the pad of your finger 2 x research source when you remove your finger completely you risk playing an open string this way your finger stays in position but without any pressure lift your fretting hand off the strings before you move to a new position get in the habit of lifting and moving as 2 separate movements you may have gotten used to keeping your fingers close to the strings so you don t accidentally fret a string incorrectly if you know where your fingers are supposed to go though this shouldn t be a worry anymore trust your muscle memory to know how to move around the fretboard and make different chord shapes 3 x research source since you already released the pressure on the string before you moved your hand the string shouldn t squeak when you take your finger off completely playing slowly can help you develop this habit if you re bad about sliding your fingers over the strings it might feel like you re learning how to play guitar all over again but don t worry with practice it will become second nature to lift then shift move to a new position with your fingers off the strings practice transitioning between different chords and positions by lifting your hand straight off the fretboard and then dropping it back into the new position this is perhaps the most difficult part of this technique especially if you frequently lose your place on the fretboard if you take your fingers off the strings 4 x research source use the pad of your finger rather than the tip to shift position sometimes you can t avoid sliding a finger over a string when you re in this situation tilt your finger slightly so that you re sliding with the pad of your finger 5 x research source the calloused tip of your finger creates more friction that causes the squeaks whereas the pad of your finger won t do this as much mute most lower strings with the palm of your picking hand as you re playing the palm of your picking hand naturally falls over the thicker strings especially when you re playing the thinner strings let your palm rest lightly on top of the strings above the string you re playing to keep them from ringing out 6 x research source this technique only works if you re playing notes on thinner strings if you re playing notes on thicker strings your palm won t be in a good position to mute strings for you cover higher strings with the fingers under your pick drop the fingers not holding the pick and lean them against the thinner strings than the one you re playing to mute them as well using them in conjunction with your palm you can successfully mute all the strings except the one you re playing 7 x research source if you re not used to playing this way it can be challenging at first to get used to resting your hand on the strings pick a solo you know well and slow down the tempo so you can practice your picking hand position after a while it will become second nature use the index finger on your fretting hand to mute nearby strings if you find it too awkward to mute strings with the fingers of your picking hand the index finger on your fretting hand can do the same job extend your index finger over the strings that aren t covered or muted by your palm 8 x research source for example if you re bending a note you can use the tip of your index finger to mute the string directly above the string you re bending so it won t make any sound and you ll get a clean bend 9 x research source this technique might involve either extending your index finger forward or bending it back to mute strings behind the string you re playing for a clean sound you want to mute all strings except the one that you re playing practice with the gain turned up so you can hear the noise if you re playing an electric guitar the gain setting determines how clean or dirty your guitar sounds higher gain results in greater noise and distortion which can also help you practice your muting to eliminate unwanted noise 10 x research source think about this like baseball players taking practice swings with a weighted bat if you can eliminate unwanted noise with high gain you ll have no problem with unwanted noise when you lower it use coated strings for a smoother playing surface buy coated strings online or in a guitar specialty shop take off your regular strings and restring your guitar with the coated strings since coated strings are slicker your fingers won t squeak as much when you slide across them 11 x research source there are many different brands with different levels of quality so it s important to compare them before you buy guitar techs at music or guitar specialty shops might be able to recommend some for you based on your experience level and playing style because coated strings are slicker than regular strings it can take some time to adjust your playing style to accommodate them when you use them for the first time you might find that you have a hard time keeping your fingers in the right place just play on them and take some time to get used to them coated or polished strings are also available for classical guitars although they can be quite pricey work on your technique to eliminate as much squeak as possible before you make this investment 12 x research source lubricate your strings to reduce noise when sliding slide a microfiber cloth under one of the strings and pull it through so it wraps the string then rub the string from end to end with the cloth to clean it repeat with all of your other strings spray the lubricant directly on the strings wiping off any excess with the cloth 13 x research source play your guitar immediately after cleaning your strings and see if that makes a difference before you apply lubricant if you clean your strings after every session you ll likely notice fewer squeaks only use a lubricant designed specifically for guitar strings other lubricants could damage either your strings or the guitar itself try working on your technique before you go with a string lubricant if poor technique is the reason for your string noise adding lubricant may not help and could even make the problem worse 14 x research source add a string dampener to quiet excess vibrations buy a string dampener a piece of cloth or canvas at guitar shops or online wrap it around the neck of your guitar above the first fret to keep all the strings partially muted especially if you re recording a string dampener can reduce string noise that isn t caused by poor fretting technique on your part 15 x research source string dampeners are most common in a studio setting where the sensitive audio equipment will pick up sounds you might not even hear yourself when you play however many guitarists also use them in a concert setting especially when playing complex solos while you can buy a string dampener made especially for this purpose a scrunchy or hair tie will likely work just as well if you re looking for a diy solution or just want to try it out before you commit to using a string dampener while playing,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to dry resin art,resin is a fun and versatile medium you can use to create all kinds of art from jewelry to sculpture to unique pieces of furniture depending on the kind of resin you re using getting it to dry or cure correctly can be a bit of a challenge there are several different kinds of resin on the market so you ll need to follow the curing instructions for your specific product to get the best results,use uv resin to create small objects or work in thin layers uv resin is a specialized form of epoxy resin that cures within minutes under a uv lamp choose this type of resin if you d like to make small objects like charms or pendants and want to cure them quickly 1 x research source you can make larger objects with uv resin but you ll need to work in very thin layers to achieve an even cure 2 x research source for instance if you want to seal a large object with a layer of uv resin you can apply a thin layer with a brush then cure it under a uv light for a project like this you may need to use a large lamp or a handheld uv flashlight that you can move around over the surface of the project select a uv lamp or flashlight with an output of at least 4 watts look for a uv light source that s strong enough to cure the type of resin you re using 4 watts is typically enough but check the directions on your resin product for any specific uv light strength or wavelength requirements in most cases uv lamps are stronger and will cure your piece faster than uv flashlights 3 x research source some uv lamps come in the form of a hood or dome that you can place over the object you need to cure if you re using this kind of lamp make sure it s big enough to completely cover the object you re trying to cure add a thin layer of resin to your object and cure it with the uv lamp after you ve applied a very thin layer of uv resin to your mold or over the surface of your work put the object under a uv lamp or flashlight aim to make the first layer about 1 millimetres 0 0039 in thick hold the light source close to the resin within around 1 inch 2 5 cm be careful not to touch the surface of the resin with the light 4 x research source test the resin with a toothpick every 2 3 seconds to see how hard it is depending on the size of the object it might take around 2 minutes for each layer to cure add new layers and cure them until you reach the desired thickness keep adding layers to your piece and curing them under the lamp once your object is as thick as you want it to be you can remove it from the mold you re all done 5 x research source take care handling the object while it s curing because of the chemical reactions taking place in the resin it can become very hot put your resin object in the sun if you don t have a uv lamp if you don t want to bother with a uv lamp you can simply set your resin object outside in the sun to cure however be aware that this could take longer or be less effective if you live in an area with a low uv index or the weather is overcast 6 x research source humidity can also prevent your resin from curing properly 7 x research source if you want to sun cure your uv resin choose a time when the weather will be sunny and dry look for a fast curing resin to dry your work faster not all epoxy resins are created equal if you want your art to cure quickly look for an epoxy that s labeled fast cure or quick cure 8 x research source slow curing epoxy resin can have certain advantages depending on your needs for example it tends to be stronger and more water resistant than fast curing resin it also gives you more time to work with the resin while it s still soft 9 x research source pre warm your resin and hardener in a hot water bath for faster curing warming up your epoxy and hardening agent before you start using it will help it set and cure a little more quickly fill a sink or bucket with hot water from your tap then let the bottles of resin and hardener soak in the hot water for 5 10 minutes before you start using them 10 x research source the water shouldn t be boiling hot hot tap water will work fine for this purpose don t heat just 1 component and not the other your resin won t cure properly if the elements aren t the same temperature mix the resin and hardener according to the package directions epoxy resin comes with 2 components the resin and a hardening agent read the instructions that come with your resin and hardener carefully and measure the components out precisely before you mix them together if you measure them in the wrong proportions your resin won t harden correctly 11 x research source for small amounts of epoxy resin you can measure out your components using medicine cups with ml markers if you re mixing up larger batches it may work better to weigh out your ingredients on a scale use a wooden stick to thoroughly mix the components together thorough mixing will help ensure that the resin cures evenly 12 x research source work slowly and gently to keep bubbles from forming use the recommended hardener that comes with your epoxy resin mixing and matching different products can affect how your resin cures avoid mixing in too much dye or pigment adding in other components can change the properties of your epoxy resin while it s okay to add a little liquid or powder pigment to give your resin a hint of color take care not to go overboard if more than about 7 of your mixture is pigment the resin might not cure properly 13 x research source experiment with adding just a few drops of your pigment of choice to see if you can get the result you want you can buy liquid pigments that are formulated to work with epoxy resins or mix in some colored mica powder keep the temperature in your workspace around 70 80 f 21 27 c epoxy resin is very sensitive to heat in cool conditions it will take much longer to dry or many never cure properly at all keep your project in a warm temperature controlled area to help it dry faster 14 x research source while the ideal temperature may vary depending on the product 70 80 f 21 27 c is typically a good temperature range for working with and curing epoxy resin 15 x research source check the packaging of your product for specific temperature guidelines if you don t want to heat your entire workspace you can use heat lamps or a space heater to raise the temperature immediately around your project apply more heat with a heat gun or blow dryer for extra fast drying you can speed up curing a little bit by applying direct heat use a tool such as a craft heat gun to carefully warm the surface of your project keep moving the heating tool to apply the heat evenly 16 x research source using too much direct heat can cause your resin to bubble or crack so watch closely and move the heat away immediately if you notice this starting to happen wait the recommended amount of time for your resin to cure while you can speed up the curing time of epoxy resin a bit it generally takes up to 72 hours for this kind of resin to cure completely 17 x research source check the guidelines on the packaging to get a sense of how long it should take the curing time will also depend on the size of your project resist the urge to handle your project before the recommended curing time is over touching or handling the resin before it s fully cured could cause smudging or bumps on the surface of your art adjust the amount of hardener to help your resin cure faster unlike epoxy resin you can adjust the curing time of polyester resin by changing the amount of hardener you incorporate into the mix 18 x research source check the instructions that come with your product to figure out which proportions of each product you should use to achieve your desired curing time make sure to use a hardener that s intended for use with polyester resin this kind of hardener is called mekp if you use hardener intended for epoxy or some other kind of resin it won t cure properly slow down curing by adding an inhibitor if you want your polyester resin to dry more slowly you can add an inhibitor to the mix this can be an advantage if you re doing a complicated project and want extra time to work with the resin while it s still soft 19 x research source a small amount of inhibitor goes a long way so check the instructions carefully to determine how much you should add let each layer gel but not completely harden before adding the next layer one disadvantage of polyester resin is that it shrinks when it hardens if you re working in layers in a mold let each layer cure until it reaches a slightly firm jello like consistency before adding the next layer however don t wait until it cures completely 20 x research source it takes about 15 20 minutes for polyester resin to reach the firm gel stage if you allow a layer to cure completely before adding the next layer the fresh resin will seep down into the mold around the shrunken first layer and give your piece an uneven appearance put your piece in a warm place to speed up curing much like epoxy resin polyester resin cures faster in a warm environment try turning up the heat in your workspace by a few degrees or setting some heat lamps or a space heater near the resin piece as it cures the higher the temperature in the room the faster your resin will harden 21 x research source to ensure your resin doesn t harden too quickly while you re working try to work in a space that s around 65 70 f 18 21 c you can increase the temperature or move the piece to a warmer space when you re done since both room temperature and the amount of hardening agent will affect how fast your resin cures you ll need to factor in both of these variables when planning your piece for example if the instructions call for 4 5 drops of hardener per 1 fluid ounce 30 ml of resin at a room temperature of 70 75 f 21 24 c decrease the amount of hardener you use by 1 drop if the room is any warmer than that wait 24 hours to several days for the resin to cure completely the amount of time it takes polyester resin to cure completely is highly variable depending on the size of the piece how much hardening agent or catalyst you used and how warm your workspace is it could take anywhere from a few hours to several days for your piece to cure completely 22 x research source look at the package directions and wait the recommended amount of time before handling your art smaller pieces like jewelry elements may cure in as little as 1 hour 23 x research source in general you can safely handle your art once it reaches the click hard stage i e it clicks when you tap it and is no longer sticky choose polyurethane if you want your art to cure quickly polyurethane resin cures fast and it will often be ready to take out of the mold in only 20 30 minutes 24 x research source pick this kind of resin if you re making relatively simple pieces that you don t need a lot of time to complete for example this might be a good option if you re making some simple charms or pendants mix the resin components carefully according to the instructions like most forms of craft resin polyurethane resins typically come with 2 components the resin and the catalyst or hardening agent the amounts of each component that you need to use can vary a lot depending on the product so read the instructions closely before you start mixing otherwise your resin won t cure correctly 25 x research source for example some polyurethane resins require you to make a 1 1 mixture of resin and catalyst while in other cases you only have to add a few drops of hardening agent to the resin mix your components thoroughly to ensure even curing check the instructions on your resin to see if it needs heat to cure polyurethane resin comes in cold curing and hot curing forms and some of these resins can even be cured under a uv lamp 26 x research source check the instructions on the package to find out the curing requirements for your particular project if your resin needs heat to cure you may need to turn up the heat in your workspace or warm your project with a heat lamp check the instructions with your product to determine the best temperature range for curing typically cold cure polyurethane resin can cure at room temperature you don t need to chill it or reduce the temperature in the room just leave it alone to dry on its own work in a dry environment to promote better curing polyurethane resin is extremely moisture sensitive so you ll need to avoid any humidity while you re working with it make sure your workspace is dry and humidity controlled and that there s no moisture in any molds you re using 27 x research source don t leave your polyurethane resin outside to cure unless you know conditions will be dry keep it out of direct sunlight since this kind of resin is also uv sensitive unless it has the right additives mixed in if you want to add color to your piece make sure you choose a pigment that s compatible with polyurethane resin some liquid pigments might affect how it cures allow your resin to dry for the recommended time in most cases polyurethane resin just needs to sit for a while in a dry environment to cure check the directions on the package for any other specific conditions your product might need to cure properly 28 x research source the amount of time it takes to cure will depend on your specific product and how large the project is avoid touching your resin while it s still soft or sticky to avoid damaging the surface,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to take the flash off a polaroid camera,using a polaroid camera and printing off photos in the moment has a special kind of joy and magic associated with it but of course with just one shot to get the photo right there s also a bit of pressure most polaroid pictures need the flash to come out clear and detailed but if you re out in bright sunlight it could make your subject look washed out in that case you may need to override or even cover the flash,turn the camera on with the power switch button or by flipping up the flashbar to engage or disengage the flash function your camera has to be on first most models have a power button located on the front or top of the camera the polaroid snap and some other models turn on when you flip up the flashbar which contains the lens 1 x research source if you re unsure of how to turn on your particular polaroid search online for a user s manual for a diagram of the buttons and functions locate and push down on the flash override button each model is slightly different but you should be able to find this button pretty easily look for the button that shows a lightning bolt with a strike going through it it s usually located next to the flash button or light it may be on the front or the back of your camera 2 x research source polaroids often need a lot of light to turn out well so the cameras are set to automatically use the flash function no matter what the flash button is sometimes just an led light that lights up when the camera is turned on to let you know the flash is ready to go push the shutter button while still holding the flash override button to disengage the flash hold the override button as you take the picture this can be a little tricky if you ve never done it before and sometimes your fingers can get in the way of the lens so take a moment to double check that your hands are out of the way before your snap your photo 3 x research source once you take the photo you can release the override button access the menu on a polaroid snap to turn the flash on or off the polaroid snap is a lot smaller than other models and doesn t have the same buttons or functions on the exterior of the camera turn the camera on and access the menu scroll to the settings option select the flash and tap through the options until a line appears through the lightning bolt 4 x research source remember to turn the flash back on once you re done taking the photo change the lighting by using the lighten darken switch rather than the flash the flash is usually pretty essential to taking great photos with clarity but sometimes you want to make images appear darker or lighter some models of polaroid have a lighten darken switch that can create a brighter or darker photo 5 x research source in dim lighting switch it to the lighten position if it s super bright out switch it to the darken position polaroids polaroid originals and the i 1 cameras have these switches cover the flash with clear tape or tissue paper to reduce its intensity if you need the flash because you re taking a photo indoors but don t like how washed out you end up looking you can diffuse the intensity of the flash by covering it with something light and semi translucent 6 x research source play around with using 1 2 or 3 pieces of tissue paper or tape for different results stand about 2 feet 610 mm away from the subject to take a clear photo if you re too close or too far away the camera lens will focus on either the background or the foreground especially if one of them is a lot darker than the other get in a close range to reduce blurriness 7 x research source this means that selfies are usually out of the question if you re using a polaroid you could use the self timer and set up the camera and position yourself a few feet away from it though to get a self portrait being too close to someone or something can produce a blurry photo sometimes that effect can look cool though if you re new to polaroids try playing around with different techniques to discover what works for you keep the sunlight or main light behind you or off to the side shooting straight into the light will result in a photo with a lot of contrast and you might not be able to see any details of the thing or person you re shooting the best rule of thumb is to stand so you re facing away from the light 8 x research source this is called backlighting crop your photos before you take them to get rid of unwanted visuals with a polaroid you don t have the option to digitally crop and alter images after the fact if you re taking a picture and don t want strangers in the background wait until they re out of the way or reposition your subject so they re not in frame 9 x research source when taking a photo step back for a moment and look at the entire screen to make sure it looks how you want the polaroid snap has the option to take digital photos that you can upload to your computer and then edit but most models print a photo automatically meaning you can t crop the edges hold the camera as still as possible until the photo is finished printing pretend that you re a statue moving around before the picture has fully printed could result in a blurry photograph 10 x research source try holding the camera in the palm of your left hand for extra stability protect your photo from light for 5 15 minutes so it develops fully black and white photos need about 5 10 minutes while color photos should have about 10 15 minutes keep your photo face down or in a pocket 11 x research source you might be tempted to shake the film to help the photo develop but that s a myth leave it alone and move it as little as possible to help your picture come out perfectly 12 x research source keep your camera and photos close to your body in cold weather temperatures lower than 55 f 13 c can make your camera and film produce photos that aren t as colorful or detailed as they could be to prevent this keep your camera warm by carrying it close to your body inside your coat would be great and keep printed photos close to your body too 13 x research source it can be hard to keep pictures close to your body without bending them but do your best gently slide them into a coat pocket if you plan ahead wear a shirt with a big front pocket so you can keep them in there,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to fix a guitar bridge,the bridge of your guitar resists up to 200 pounds of string tension yet it s affixed to your guitar with nothing but glue it stands to reason that after years of playing your guitar that bridge might start to come loose if it pulls up too much or stays loose for too long it can affect the sound of your guitar there s also a risk that the bridge itself will crack if your bridge is cracked replace it with a new one however if your bridge is still intact you can re glue it so your guitar will sound like it did when it was new this isn t necessarily an easy repair job so if you re not comfortable working on your guitar take it to an experienced guitar tech or luthier to get the repair done 1 x research source,check the looseness of the bridge with a thin sheet of paper try to slide a piece of paper under your bridge between the bridge and the top of your guitar if it slips through easily this means the glue has loosened and your bridge needs to be fixed 2 x research source even if you can see a gap between the bottom of your bridge and the top of your guitar you still need to check it it might be that the guitar s lacquer doesn t reach to the edge of the bridge which is attached to the bare wood which can create the appearance of a gap if the bridge itself is cracked or warped it will need to be replaced don t attempt to re glue it take the strings off your guitar before you can work on the bridge carefully remove all of the strings on your guitar then pop out the string pins in the bridge set all of these to the side so you can replace them later 3 x research source inspect the bridge again with the strings off to make sure there aren t any cracks or other damage to the bridge that you didn t notice before use a heating pad to loosen up the existing glue if the bridge is just starting to lift the heat will melt the remaining glue so you can remove the bridge without damaging it check the glue every couple of minutes by wiggling the bridge a bit remove the heat when it feels loose 4 x research source luthiers use a specially designed heat blanket for this purpose a dry heating pad designed to soothe sore muscles will work for this don t leave the heat on your guitar any longer than necessary to avoid damage to the finish or the wood pry the bridge off gently with a razor blade work your blade carefully around all the edges of the bridge don t force it you may need to go around more than once before the bridge comes off freely then set the bridge off to the side 5 x research source if you have an acoustic electric guitar be careful not to remove any of the wiring when you remove the bridge simply leave that attached and let the bridge dangle to the side 6 x research source scrape any remaining glue off the top of the guitar any dried glue still left on the top of your guitar or the bottom of the bridge will create an uneven surface to glue your bridge back on use a chisel or razor blade to gently remove it 7 x research source you want to glue your bridge directly to the guitar if you attempt to glue it to old dried glue it won t seal and you ll have to re glue it all over again sandpaper also works well to clean dried glue from the body of the guitar and the underside of the bridge just be careful not to sand too hard score the underside of the bridge with a razor blade cut some horizontal and vertical lines across the bottom of the bridge so the glue will get more traction for a tighter bond be careful not to gouge too deeply as you could crack the bridge 8 x research source if your bridge was attached directly to the lacquer of the guitar rather than the raw wood as is the case with some more inexpensive guitars score the lacquer as well take care not to cut into the actual wood of the guitar when you do this use a ruler to measure the midpoint of your bridge marking the midpoint of your bridge helps you place it back on the guitar in the exact same spot it was before mark the centerline of the bridge with a pencil both on the top of the bridge and on the guitar where the bridge sits then you can simply match up those 2 lines to put your bridge back in place 9 x research source measure and mark your bridge to ensure you replace it correctly use a ruler to mark the middle of your bridge and line it up with the middle of the spot where your bridge was located on the top of your guitar this will help you line up your bridge so you can re glue it in the exact same spot 10 x research source you can also place wooden dowels in the bridge pin holes and set your bridge down on top of those after you ve placed your bridge you can just pop the dowels out they ll help you line up the bridge over the holes if you don t put your bridge back in exactly the same spot it will throw your string tension off and ruin your guitar s intonation choose a c clamp large enough to clamp the bridge through the soundhole the clamp ensures that your bridge is glued tightly to your guitar get a deep c clamp capable of fitting through the soundhole of your guitar and clamping the bridge down tightly check the fit before you put glue on the bridge to make sure it ll work 11 x research source depending on the size and design of your clamp you may want to use a caul which is simply a piece of wood that you lay between the braces of the clamp and the bridge itself the caul distributes the pressure of the clamp more evenly so you can apply enough pressure to set the glue without damaging the bridge you can also use 3 clamps using 1 for each end of the bridge and 1 for the middle if you use 3 clamps you won t need to apply as much pressure on each clamp 12 x research source apply wood glue to the bottom of the bridge squeeze the wood glue around the entire edge of the bridge and inside keeping away from the bridge pin holes don t worry about using too much glue you can wipe away any excess after you clamp down the bridge 13 x research source you could also apply the glue to the top of your guitar rather than to your bridge there s no need to glue both however it won t make the bond any stronger you ll just end up with a lot of extra glue press your bridge into place on the top of your guitar use the marks or dowels you placed in the bridge pin holes to line up your bridge in the exact spot it was before check the outer edges to make sure it s lined up properly while the glue is still wet then press down firmly 14 x research source when you press down you ll likely see excess glue seeping out from the edges of the bridge wait until you ve clamped down the bridge to wipe it away otherwise you risk wiping away too much glue and your bridge won t bond to your guitar clamp the bridge down onto the guitar if you re only using 1 clamp place your caul over top of the bridge then place the bottom of the clamp through the soundhole into the body of your guitar under the bridge clamp it down just enough to hold the seal tight but not enough to squeeze out all of the glue 15 x research source if you re using 3 clamps get the ends in place first and set the middle clamp last if you don t want the clamps to damage the finish on the bridge lay a piece of felt or cloth between the bridge and the clamp wipe the excess glue and leave the bridge clamped at least overnight use a cotton swab or rag to clean off any excess glue that seeped out from under the edge of the bridge then leave your guitar laying flat with the clamps in place so the glue can dry 16 x research source it will take at least 12 hours for the glue to dry however if you take off the clamps and the glue hasn t dried you effectively have to start all over to be safe you might want to leave your guitar for a couple of days before you attempt to restring it 17 x research source if you try to restring your guitar before the glue has completely dried the tension from the strings 200 pounds worth will pop the bridge off again 18 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to read flute tabs,the flute is a beautiful wind instrument but it can be a little intimidating if you aren t familiar with all the fingerings with regular focus and practice you can begin to read and play flute music with the help of flute tabs or fingering tabs which let you know how to play specific notes and accidentals if you re learning to play the native american flute take some time to review native american or nakai tablature which is displayed on the sheet music with focused practice and dedication you can put your best foot forward as you start your journey as a flutist,review the proper way to hold a flute flute fingering charts show you which keys need to be pressed down but don t tell you which fingers press down which keys practice extending your left arm and hand around the back of the instrument and placing your right hand along the lower half of the instrument keep in mind that your left hand will play the keys on the left half of the instrument while your right hand will play the keys on the right half 1 x research source for reference you use your left thumb to play the keys along the bottom of the flute your left pinky presses the side key along the center of the instrument and your right pinky presses the side keys along the bottom of the flute do your best to keep your fingers close to the keys so you can transition between notes more easily 2 x research source if your flute is open holed be sure to cover the openings completely with your fingertips compare a fingering chart to your physical instrument keep in mind that flute tabs are designed to make the flute learning process more streamlined pretend that the flute represented in the fingering chart is the flute that you re holding in your hands this will make it easier for you to deduce each fingering and place your fingers on the proper keys 3 x research source it s perfectly normal to feel a little overwhelmed when looking at a flute tab for the first time just practice slowly and focus on 1 note at a time identify black keys as the ones you press down place your fingers on any keys that are black or filled in on the instrument depending on the note you may be pressing down a lot of keys at once or you may only be pressing a few at a time 4 x research source for example when you re playing a high b you only press down the first circular key the rightmost bottom key and the curved side key at the end of the flute when you play a low c you press down the first 6 circular keys the rightmost bottom key and the end key made up of 2 parallel bars keep any white keys open and unpressed hover your fingers above any keys that appear white or not filled in avoid pressing down these keys or else you may end up playing the wrong note as you practice 5 x research source for example if you keep every keep open except for the curved side key you ll play a high c if you press down the first circular key along with the curved side key you ll play a high b instead watch for any extra side keys to play both regular notes and accidentals flute has side keys to help adjust the sound of each note look along the middle and end of the instrument to find these side keys which are usually played with your pinky finger 6 x research source for instance the curved side key at the end of the instrument is used to play a variety of notes the key that looks like 2 parallel bars is only used to play very low notes learn the fingerings for the 8 regular notes focus on the basic notes without any sharps or flats c d e f g a and b keep in mind that these notes have different fingerings depending on their octave or how high or low the note is it may also help to review the key signature for a piece of music which will tell you which notes you ll have to play in the song 7 x research source for instance a low c is played with almost all of the flute keys while a high c is played with only 2 keys memorize the fingerings for the accidentals that are written in the song look over the recommended fingerings for different sharps and flats especially if they appear in the sheet music you re about to play note that a lot of accidentals are played with the curved side key along the end of the instrument 8 x research source for example nearly all flats and sharps are played with the curved side key fingering charts are a helpful guide as you re learning to play the flute but they won t be present in your flute sheet music hold a native american flute with your left hand above your right keep your fingers flat on the flute which ensures that all the openings are covered press your left pointer middle and ringer finger along the top 3 holes then use your right pointer middle and ring finger to cover the lower 3 holes as you hold the instrument keep it angled about 45 degrees away from your body 9 x research source if you re playing a bigger flute the openings may be spaced out a bit more keep in mind that some native american flutes only have 5 holes for these instruments you use your left pointer and middle finger to cover the top 2 openings while using your right hand to cover the bottom 3 openings 10 x research source read native american flute tabs vertically keep in mind that native american flutes are played vertically like a clarinet or recorder with this in mind native american flute tabs are displayed vertically in the same way that you d hold the instrument 11 x research source some pieces of sheet music will place the designated flute fingering below each note place your fingers on any black openings take a close look at each tab and see if any of the keys are blacked out center your fingers over these black keys so you can successfully create a note with your instrument 12 x research source for instance you can play a low f by pressing your fingers down on all the openings leave any white holes open create more complex notes by keeping some of your fingers lifted as you play specific notes some notes require a lot of open spaces while others don t have as many 13 x research source for instance you play a high g by not pressing down any of the openings find the tab beneath each note on your sheet music unlike traditional flute music sheet music for the native american flute displays the exact fingering for each note through a tab as you go through the song glance at the tab diagram below the note to review the fingering for each note 14 x research source your left hand will cover the top 3 openings while your right hand will cover the lower 3 openings 15 x research source the tab will look like a small diagram of a native american flute some of the openings on the flute will be black and some will be white depending on the note you need to play cover certain openings with your fingers to play a note double check the diagram or tab beneath each note on your sheet music so you know which note to play cover any blacked out openings with your fingers and leave any white openings uncovered blow a steady stream of air into the instrument to create individual notes on your sheet music 16 x research source for instance on a traditional native american flute covering the first 5 openings creates a middle a note on the treble clef identify the distinct key signature with 4 sharps unlike the traditional flute the native american flute is naturally tuned to the e major scale which has 4 sharps keep in mind that most native american flute sheet music will be composed in this key 17 x research source play a simple minor scale to get the hang of the flute the pentatonic minor scale is the default scale for the native american flute and only involves 6 notes start by playing a middle f middle a middle b high c high e and high f this scale can help you get the hang of how this instrument is supposed to be played 18 x research source the exact fingerings may differ slightly depending on the type of flute you re playing try playing more complex scales with your instrument keep in mind that the native american flute doesn t operate under the traditional scales that orchestral flutes do instead you can choose to practice the major pentatonic northern pentatonic blues hexatonic and other scales to really get the hang of your instrument experimenting with these scales can give you a more well rounded understanding of how the instrument works 19 x research source for specific scale diagrams check here http flutecraft org 12 scales to play on native american flute 342 play simple sheet music while reading the nakai tab search online for simple songs that you can play on the native american flute place your fingers over the proper openings as you read through the notes slowly making your way through the song don t feel like you have to go super fast play through the song

how to paint a ceiling with a sprayer,using a sprayer is a fast and efficient way to paint they re popular with professionals who have to cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time so a sprayer may be the best choice if you want to get a job done fast painting a ceiling with a sprayer isn t much different from painting walls you still have to prep the area clean out the sprayer and work in broad even strokes with the right prep work and technique you should finish painting your ceiling in no time,cover the floors and furniture with a plastic drop cloth painting with a sprayer can be messy so make sure all your floors and furniture are covered spread a drop cloth around the entire room before getting started use a plastic sheet instead of cloth so paint spills won t soak through 1 x research source try to remove as much furniture as you can before starting this way you won t have to work around any obstructions while you re painting tape plastic sheets to cover the walls a paint sprayer could splash paint around if you aren t careful so protect your walls take plastic sheets long enough to cover your walls from floor to ceiling line each sheet up with the top edge where the wall meets the ceiling and tape it in place work around the whole room until all the walls are covered 2 x research source cut holes in the plastic around any windows so you can ventilate the room use plastic instead of cloth sheets the paint can soak through cloth if you re also planning on painting the walls then you don t have to worry so much about covering them you can paint over any splashes or imperfections when you re paint the walls open all the windows in the room painting with a sprayer sends a lot more fumes into the air than using a brush or roller ventilate the room by opening all the windows and keeping them open while you work for extra protection use a window fan to pull fumes outside 3 x research source paint sprayers aren t designed for use in enclosed spaces without windows if the room you re working in doesn t have any windows then use a roller to paint the ceiling instead otherwise you could inhale harmful paint fumes sand the ceiling if it s been painted before a light sanding helps the paint stick better and gives you an even coat attach 120 grit sandpaper to a pole sander then apply moderate pressure and sweep the sander across the ceiling continue sanding until you cover the whole ceiling 4 x research source you ll probably have to change the paper a few times when it feels like the sander isn t gripping the ceiling as well then the paper is clogged and needs changing if you don t have a pole sander you could use regular sandpaper while standing on a latter be very careful and maintain your balance and don t stand on the highest step wash the ceiling with warm water and dish soap any dust or dirt on the ceiling will give you an uneven coat and could stop the paint from sticking correctly fill a bucket with warm water and a few drops of dish soap dip in a clean mop and wring it out so it s only damp then wipe down the ceiling 5 x research source let the ceiling dry completely before painting you could also use a sponge but you ll have to stand on a ladder to reach the ceiling strain the paint you can use standard paint in a sprayer but it won t spray well if it s too thick set up a paint strainer bag in an empty bucket then pour the paint into the strainer let it sit and run through the strainer remove the strainer and use the thinned paint in the bucket 6 x research source if there is still some paint left in the strainer pick it up and run your hand down the strainer to work out the remaining paint put a rubber glove on first dip the suction hose into the bucket of paint the suction hose pulls paint into the sprayer take this piece and insert it into the bucket of strained paint 7 x research source if you aren t sure which part the suction hose is check your user manual it usually looks like a small shower head set the spray to prime look on the side of the sprayer for a knob that switches between prime and paint set the knob to prime this is the setting to clear the sprayer out before painting 8 x research source even if the sprayer is new you should still prime it to get started this prevents any bubbles or dirt from coming out when you re trying to paint put the painting tube into an empty bucket the priming process forces any old paint or water out of the sprayer before you paint any empty bucket will do set the sprayer tube into the bucket and hold it there so it doesn t fall out 9 x research source newer paint sprayers are airless so you don t have to connect them to an air source older sprayers might still need a compressed air attachment to work so you ll have to connect this before priming prime the sprayer until fresh paint comes out of the tube hit the on switch to start priming the sprayer water and old paint will start coming out of the tube keep the sprayer running until new paint free of bubbles starts coming out then turn the sprayer off 10 x research source if you ve never used the sprayer before then there probably isn t any water in the system in this case a quick priming to get started is all you need run the sprayer on paint when you re done priming turn the knob back to the paint setting put the painting tube back into the empty bucket and turn the sprayer on run the sprayer for a few seconds until there are no bubbles coming out of the tube then power the sprayer down and get ready to paint 11 x research source sometimes the painting mode is marked spray instead of paint put on a mask and goggles before starting painting with a sprayer sends a lot of fumes into the air so take extra steps to protect yourself wear goggles that wrap around your eyes so paint can t drip around them also put on a mask with a chemical filter like a respirator so you don t breathe in any fumes 12 x research source a dust mask is better than nothing but still not good enough for painting with a sprayer attach an extension tip if you can t reach the ceiling some paint sprayers have extenders to reach high places which are ideal for ceilings if your ceiling is too high to reach with a standard tip on then attach the extender 13 x research source the process of changing tips is different for all sprayers so follow the directions in your user manual if you don t have an extender then you ll have to use a ladder to paint the ceiling be very careful and maintain your balance while you re working spray in long straight lines to cover the ceiling hold the sprayer about 6 12 in 15 30 cm from the ceiling surface then power it on and pull the trigger to begin spraying spray in a long sweeping line from one side of the ceiling to the other 14 x research source point the sprayer directly at the ceiling as much as you can for the best coverage maintain a consistent distance from the ceiling while you re spraying otherwise you won t get an even coat overlap each stroke by 50 working in a line pattern is the best way to get an even coat of paint on the ceiling when you make subsequent strokes overlap the previous one by about 50 so you get even coverage 15 x research source maintain straight smooth strokes for the best results spraying in a wavy motion like you would with a paint can will give you an uneven coat spray over the first layer in horizontal strokes to get an even coat when you ve covered the ceiling with long broad lines then work in the opposite direction spray another layer horizontally so it intersects the lines from your first pass this gives you an even coat of paint 16 x research source this step is still part of the first coat so you don t have to wait for the paint to dry some sprayers have vertical and horizontal nozzles that you can use for the same effect in this case you don t have to work in the opposite direction apply a second coat when the first one dries depending on the paint type it might take 4 8 hours for the base coat to dry when it does then apply a second coat in the same pattern and style that you used for the first one this should give you a nice even coat of paint on your ceiling 17 x research source remove the drop cloths and sheets when the paint is dry start by taking the sheets off the walls and removing the tape then pull up the drop cloths carefully roll them up gently to avoid kicking up dirt or paint then fold the cloths over so no paint drips out take them outside to air out 18 x research source if the ceiling edges aren t even because tape or plastic was in the way you could touch up the area with a brush later one,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to paint white walls,a fresh coat of white paint can really brighten up a room and make it look sharp and modern white décor can even make rooms look bigger so it s ideal for smaller apartments or bedrooms painting a wall isn t a special skill but painting walls white requires a few tricks for the best results with the right preparation priming and application the darker base color won t bleed through and your walls will look brand new,remove any furniture frames or fixtures from the room and walls move as much furniture out of the room as possible so you can paint without any obstructions if you have any removable frames pictures or decorations on the wall remove them before you get started then go around the wall and remove any light fixtures or outlet covers so they don t get in the way 1 x research source if you can t remove all of the furniture from the room make sure you cover it with a sheet to keep it clean put all of the fixtures or outlets into a bag so you don t lose any pieces keep track of all the screws you remove so you can put the fixtures back put painter s tape over electrical outlets plugs and wires so you don t get any paint in them tape a drop cloth or sheet over the floor painting is always a messy job even if you re careful cover the whole floor with a drop cloth long enough to stretch from one wall to the other tape the cloth down so no paint drips underneath it 2 x research source you might need multiple drop cloths to cover the whole floor tape off the areas that you don t want to paint even if you re a skilled painter you could still slip in some spots run painter s tape along the edge of the wall along the ceiling baseboards and any molding along the wall this protects any spots that you don t want to paint 3 x research source paint can still bleed through tape so try to avoid painting over it it s just there as a precaution open the windows to get rid of any paint fumes it s much safer to work in a well ventilated area so open all the windows in the room continue airing out the room when you re done painting so the fumes don t build up 4 x trustworthy source consumer products safety commission independent u s government agency responsible for protecting consumers by developing safety standards and conducting product research go to source if you re sensitive to paint fumes use a window fan to pull more fumes out you can also prevent fumes from getting into other rooms by taping a plastic sheet over the doorway repair any cracks or holes in the wall before painting any imperfections on the wall will show clearly under white paint so go over the wall carefully to find cracks or holes fill them in with spackle or caulk scrape away any excess filler so the repair is flat then let it dry sand the repairs down so they re smooth and don t show through the paint 5 x research source spackle could take 1 4 hours to dry depending on the type caulk can dry in as little as 30 minutes check the instructions on the product you use and give the repairs enough time to dry sand the walls lightly this helps the primer and paint stick and will make white paint look especially good use 120 grit sandpaper and lightly sand the wall along with any other surfaces that you re painting use a gentle circular motion and work your way across the wall 6 x research source pay special attention to any rough or raised spots smooth them out so they don t show through the paint always wear a dust mask while you re sanding even if the windows are open if you have textured walls then skip the sanding you could remove the texture accidentally clean the walls with warm water to remove any dirt dust and dirt can show through white paint so make sure the walls are completely clean before painting 7 x research source fill a bucket with warm water and add a few drops of mild dish soap dip and wring out a sponge then wash all the walls in a circular motion rinse the walls with a damp cloth afterward 8 x research source let the walls dry completely before you start painting if you re painting a textured wall it ll be tougher to clean use a vacuum with a brush attachment to get dirt out of the grooves and crevices before washing the wall with a sponge 9 x research source match the shade of white paint to the room you might think there is only one type of white but there are actually many different shades some have a slightly blue tint some are closer to cream and some lean closer to gray shop for different color choices and get a few samples to see how they look in your room pick the one that matches the décor the best 10 x research source hold the paint samples up to the wall to see if they match the existing décor and look good in the light if you can t decide on a color paint a small section of the wall and leave it there for a few days notice how the light hits that spot and how it complements the rest of the room if it looks good then pick that one you could also ask a designer at the hardware store for suggestions on the best shade choose a gloss or semi gloss paint so the walls are easier to clean white paint is more vulnerable to stains and hand prints so you ll probably have to work a bit harder to keep the walls clean gloss or semi gloss paints are easier to clean and wash so these are the best paint choices for white walls 11 x research source gloss paints can show any imperfections like cracks or holes more clearly so be sure you ve repaired and sanded the surface before painting apply white stain blocking primer so the base color won t bleed through stain blocking primer is ideal for white paint because it absorbs base colors and prevents them from bleeding through the best way to apply primer is with a roller pour the primer into a paint tray and dip the roller in wipe off any excess on the side of the tray then roll a primer onto wall sections roughly 3 ft 0 91 m by 3 ft 0 91 m re wetting the roller as you need to work across the wall until you ve covered it all 12 x research source if you have to paint corners or edges brush the primer on with a regular paintbrush primers come in a few different colors but use a white one since you re using white paint apply an extra coat of primer if you re painting over a dark color in most cases one coat or primer is enough however if the base color was dark like brown black or red then use a second coat of primer to be safe wait 3 4 hours for the first coat to dry then apply another this should block the base color from showing through the new paint then wait another 3 4 hours for the second coat to dry 13 x research source if you have any doubts about whether or not you need a second primer coat then apply a second coat you don t want to finish painting only to realize the base color is bleeding through sand the wall again after the primer dries this helps the paint stick even better and should give you a more even coat after the primer dries lightly sand the entire wall again with 120 grit sandpaper 14 x research source brush the paint around corners and along edges this is called cutting in and it helps you avoid getting paint where you don t want it dip your brush into the paint and wipe off any excess then brush a line of paint 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm thick along the tape that you put down continue until you ve filled in the edges of the wall 15 x research source also brush 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm on either side of each corner since you won t be able to reach into there with a roller roll a thick coat of paint onto the wall you can apply the paint the same way that you applied the primer pour the paint into a paint tray and wet your roller wipe off any excess so the roller is just damp with paint roll the paint onto the wall in alternating m and w patterns until you cover each 3 ft 0 91 m by 3 ft 0 91 m section then move on continue in that pattern until you ve covered the whole wall 16 x research source since you re painting with white lay the paint down thick this prevent the base color from bleeding through if any drips roll over it with your roller so you don t cause any drip lines on the final coat make sure you use a clean roller or tray so you don t mix primer and paint paint usually takes 8 hours to dry but check the drying time for the specific paint that you use paint a second coat when the first one dries most walls need 2 coats for good coverage use a brush and cut in around the edges of the wall like you did before then roll on the paint in the same m and w pattern that you used for the first coat continue until you ve covered the whole surface then let the paint dry 17 x research source in most cases 2 coats are enough however if the paint dries and you can still see some of the base color then add a third let the paint cure for 24 48 hours paint needs at least a day to dry completely leave it alone and don t touch it for 24 48 hours after that time passes then you can continue with redecorating your room 18 x research source clean up when you re done painting once the paint is all dry you can clean the room pull up the drop cloth and remove all of the tape you put on the walls reinstall and fixtures or switches that you removed as well 19 x research source try to roll up and fold the drop cloth when you pick it up this way you won t spread any dust in your home then take it outside and let it air out,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to adjust the truss rod on a guitar,adjusting the truss rod of your guitar alters your guitar s neck relief the amount of bow in the neck measured by the distance between the strings and the frets some bow is necessary for a guitar to play well but you don t want it to be bowed too much while the amount of relief is a matter of personal preference most guitars play well with a relief somewhere between 0 008 and 0 015 inches 0 20 and 0 38 mm adjusting the truss rod is not overly complex however if you don t have a working familiarity with the parts of your guitar and how they work together take your guitar to an experienced guitar tech or luthier rather than attempting to make this adjustment yourself 1 x research source,tune your guitar to pitch use the strings and tuning you normally use when you play to make sure you get your neck relief right different gauges of strings may call for additional adjustment 2 x research source you don t have to take off the strings to adjust your truss rod in fact you need them on and tuned to the correct pitch to make sure you get the relief correct if you adjust a truss rod without the strings on your adjustment will be off when you put the strings back on 3 x research source your strings exert pressure on the neck of your guitar that will gradually cause it to bow more even if your neck relief was good for you when you first bought your guitar it can change over time sight the neck to determine if it s straight lay your guitar flat on a table or sit and hold it with the base of your guitar resting on your foot then close one eye and peer down the neck of your guitar from the headstock you ll be able to see if it s bowed outward or inward this will give you some idea of where to start with adjusting the relief 4 x research source don t worry if you haven t done this before and you don t know exactly what you re looking for sighting the neck simply gives you a general idea of the condition of the neck of your guitar and its overall straightness attach capos to the 1st and 15th frets using 2 capos to clamp the strings eliminates the issue of added string height from the nut at the top and the bridge at the bottom this allows you to use your strings as a straight edge which makes it less complicated to measure your neck relief 5 x research source if you have a shorter scale guitar you might not be able to get a capo on the 15th fret place your second capo on the fret closest to the body of the guitar where you can fit a capo if you don t have 2 capos you can also fret the low e string at the 1st and 15th frets to get the same result however you ll likely need another set of hands to take the measurement 6 x research source measure the gap between the string and the 7th fret use your feeler gauges to determine the gap between the 6th string of your guitar and the 7th fret feeler gauges are thin strips of metal each marked with a particular width start with the one where you want your relief to be use 0 007 inches 0 18 mm if you re not sure if it fits snugly between the string and the top of the fret your relief is just fine 7 x research source if the feeler gauge encounters resistance or won t fit at all between the string and the top of the fret you likely need to increase your neck relief on the other hand if there s still space between the string and the top of the fret after you insert the feeler gauge you need to decrease your relief remove the truss rod cover if necessary generally you can access your truss rod in the headstock of your guitar some guitars have a small plate that screws in over top to cover the access point if your guitar has one of these covers remove it to get to the truss rod 8 x research source with some acoustic guitars you can only adjust the truss rod through the soundhole if you don t see a cover or a notch for the truss rod in the headstock look through the soundhole towards the neck to spot the truss rod 9 x research source fit the appropriate hex key to turn your truss rod if you have a new guitar it likely came with a truss rod key unfortunately if you bought your guitar used this tool might be missing check the case and see if you ve got one if not look at the top of the truss rod and try to figure out what size tool you need 10 x research source truss rod keys aren t standard if you have a key for the truss rod of another guitar it might not fit even if the guitars come from the same manufacturer make sure the tool you re using fits snugly and doesn t slip otherwise you could strip your truss rod turn the truss rod no more than 1 8 of a turn a tiny adjustment can make a huge difference when you re adjusting a truss rod give it a slight turn to the left to loosen it a little so it ll be easier to turn then turn it 1 8 of a turn clockwise if you want to decrease the relief or counter clockwise if you want to increase the relief 11 x research source it can be hard to guess how much of a turn you re giving the truss rod if you don t have a lot of experience making these kinds of minute adjustments it might be easier for you to think of 1 8 as half of a quarter turn retune your guitar and check the relief it s possible that your adjustments have caused your guitar to fall out of tune check to make sure then clamp your strings down at the 1st and 15th fret or whichever higher fret you used before and check the relief with your feeler gauge 12 x research source if you find that you ve gone too far you ll have to adjust the truss rod back in the other direction it s also worth taking a little time to play your guitar and see how it feels neck relief is a personal thing if it feels right for you to play you may not need to make any further adjustments even if the measurement isn t exactly what you thought you wanted it s completely up to you adjust the truss rod another 1 8 turn or less if necessary you don t want to turn your truss rod more than a 1 4 turn at a time however if your measurements showed that you still don t have the relief that you want you still have room to make a second adjustment to get it closer to right 13 x research source go slow and don t force it you could damage your guitar a tiny adjustment is all it takes these adjustments can take some time to get right so don t beat yourself up if you didn t get it right on the first try especially if you ve never adjusted a truss rod before check your relief again after 24 hours the neck of your guitar takes time to settle so you might not get the full effect when you check it immediately after adjusting the truss rod leave it alone for a day then check the relief again and make another adjustment if necessary 14 x research source avoid moving your guitar during this period changes in temperature and humidity can impact the truss rod adjustment you ve made,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to cover up graffiti,graffiti can be a real nuisance especially if your business or building gets tagged property owners deal with this kind of vandalism all the time so lots of people know what you re going through fortunately you can cover this eyesore without too much trouble there are many ways to strip or remove graffiti entirely but generally the easiest and cheapest method is simply painting over it by choosing the right paint and prepping the surface correctly you can cover graffiti entirely for a fresh start,get a stain blocking primer so the graffiti doesn t soak through stain blockers absorb older paint and prevent it from bleeding through a new coat you can find this primer type at standard hardware and paint stores 1 x research source while using the right primer is always important this is especially important if you re using a lighter color like tan to cover the graffiti light paint colors like white or baby blue probably won t cover the graffiti well if you do want to repaint the wall with a light color then you ll probably have to remove the graffiti completely first you can either power wash it off or use chemical removers to strip the paint choose a glossy enamel paint to resist future graffiti glossy paints are harder to stick to and future graffiti will wash off easier they re also more durable and are usually used on outdoor surfaces use this type of paint so if the surface gets tagged again you can wash it off instead of repainting the whole thing 2 x research source you can find enamel paint at a standard hardware or paint store this is a better choice if you re covering a large area instead of just spot treating glossy paint in one small spot won t do a lot to fight graffiti in the future spray paint doesn t work well for covering graffiti because it s tough to cover a large surface with it and the graffiti might bleed through latex or water based paint is also not as durable and won t work well for outdoor surfaces match the new paint with the old base color if it s dark if you can perfectly match the coverup paint with the base color then your job will be a lot easier dark base colors are the easiest to paint over it s best if you still have some of the old paint on hand if not try to get a matching color from the hardware store 3 x research source if you aren t sure exactly what color the base paint is get a few samples or swatches to hold up to the wall and compare do not cover the graffiti with a different color than the base color officials agree that patchwork using different colors invites more graffiti in the future 4 x research source switch to a darker paint if the current color is tan or white if the base color was very light like white or tan then covering the graffiti with the same color probably won t work the darker graffiti will bleed through the new paint even if you apply multiple coats in this case switch to a darker color like black this will cover the graffiti without any bleed through 5 x research source darker colors like brown or black are usually the easiest to color match and repaint so these are good choices if you re in a very graffiti prone area buy an extra can in case you have to cover more graffiti in the future since color matching is very important it helps to have some of the new paint you use on hand in case you need it in the future that way if the surface gets tagged again you can just cover that spot instead of repainting the whole thing 6 x research source if you don t keep extra paint around at least note the exact color and manufacturer of the paint so you can get more if you have to keep in mind that manufacturers sometimes change or discontinue color lines this is why keeping an extra can around is better than just making note of the color clean the surface with water and soap the new paint won t stick as well if there is any dirt or grease on the surface mix water and some dish soap then use a rag brush or roller to wash the surface let it dry completely before you paint 7 x research source if the surface is large and you can t reach it all a power or pressure washer might be a better choice you could also just hose down the surface this isn t as good as a full wash but it s better than nothing prime the area so the graffiti doesn t show through the new paint priming blocks the graffiti from bleeding through the new coat of paint and also helps the paint stick better brush or roll on an even coat of stain blocker primer to cover the whole surface that you ll be painting 8 x research source wait for the primer to dry completely before painting for most primers this is about 3 4 hours but check the instructions on the product that you use if you re using a very dark paint like black then you probably don t have to use a stain blocker however still prime the wall before painting cover the graffiti section if you can match the colors perfectly if you can match the new paint with the base paint then you can just paint over the graffitied section paint a square border around the graffiti then roll or brush the new paint over the graffiti apply an even smooth coat to cover it entirely 9 x research source do not do this with 2 different colors a section with different colors invites new graffiti 10 x research source if you start painting and realize that the colors don t match as well as you thought then you might have to repaint everything wait for the paint to dry and see how well the colors match before making a decision repaint the entire area if you re using a new color if you can t match the colors then it s best to repaint the whole surface instead of just covering the graffiti pour the new paint into a tray and dip a brush or roller in then cover the entire surface graffiti and all with the new paint 11 x research source for large surfaces like the side of a building you may need a professional painting service if you have to reach high areas be very careful when using a ladder don t stand on the top step and make sure the ladder is secure before climbing up apply an additional coat if the graffiti is still visible let the paint dry for 3 4 hours then check if you can still see any graffiti bleeding through if so then cover it with another coat of paint 12 x research source your paint may need additional drying time depending on the type check the instructions on the paint you use,Arts-and-Entertainment

on site if appropriate or nearby if you re making a multi day vacation of it which is a good idea if you want to hit up the amusement park staying on site or nearby will make it all much easier have a plan while it may seem tempting riding rides in whatever order you feel like can mean you travel from one end of the park to the other many more times than is necessary and your feet will be very sore as a result to avoid this get a park map and use it ride things in order or at least ride everything you want to go on in one specific area of the park before moving on to another have enough money on hand depending on how long you will be at the park make plans for what you will eat keep in mind that park food is expensive have pills with you if you think you ll need them if you have nausea but

storage first try to check the weather report for the area you re going visit dress accordingly for the weather try to avoid wearing dark colored clothes such as black or dark grey if it is during summer wearing these colors could make you warmer and you may start sweating also if you re going on the water rides have a swimsuit on underneath your clothes wear good shoes flip flops aren t really the best idea for an amusement park especially rides that leave your feet dangling wear supportive sneakers or walking shoes don t wear loose clothing if you want to wear a hat always remember to put it in a secure pocket before going on a ride keep your wallet or purse secure they can be easily lost in the hustle and bustle of an amusement park tie up long hair hair past shoulder length can easily get tangled on a windy ride braids are recommended as they stay closer to the head and don t have loose hair like ponytails don t wear earrings many coasters can be rough and you don t want holes poked into the back of your head some earrings may get stuck in your hair or attire however if you really want to wear earrings wear non dangling ones such as studs or pearls take plenty of sunscreen especially in the summertime most of the ride lines will subject you to the elements whatever they are take a water bottle it s easy to get dehydrated out in the sun all day don t take a ton of stuff unless you re visiting with someone who won t be riding most of the rides don t take huge bags or purses with you if you can help it you won t be able to take these on most of the rides you ll either have to leave them with a non rider pay for a locker or stuff them into bins before getting onto a ride this last option offers no guarantee that someone won t walk off with your brand new coach purse while you re on a coaster wear something with big pockets that either zipper or button closed all you really need is some cash and maybe your phone you can always leave a jacket in your car and go get it later always take medication with you or take it beforehand who knows you might need it go on a weekday if possible avoid weekends at any park during the summer months once school is out places like cedar point are packed especially on the weekends arrive early if you want to catch the shortest ride wait times and escape the heat of the day get to the park as early as possible and people do arrive earlier so they can dash to their favorite rides as soon as possible pace yourself take a break from the coasters every once in a while perhaps throwing in a train or gondola ride these can also serve as great ways of getting around the park that don t wear out your sneakers don t force people to go on a ride don t force yourself or a friend to go on a certain ride especially if you or your friend does not fit the criteria for the ride if you are too short weigh too much have medical conditions or are pregnant be careful about what rides you decide to go on if you want to play games and buy souvenirs wait until you and whoever is with you have had enough of the other attractions by leaving it to the end you won t have to be restricted by the giant stuffed animal you re

aided by a bystanders instead have them focus on who is most likely to be a good choice and why a mother with children a grandfather with grandchildren or a daycare worker these are all people who are entrusted with children and are probably good with children there is no guarantee that a park employee is completely safe after all practice what the child should do in case they cannot find parents going over the drill once at the park entrance is unlikely to be successful this is something you can do while waiting in a line or while waiting for dad to finish his lunch ask the child who he or she could go to for help in the immediate area do this at home too children can get separated from caregivers at malls grocery stores and downtown it is a game that helps situational awareness

sure everyone in your group including parents and older siblings are wearing the same bright recognizable clothing bold orange or yellow shirts will work fine for this purpose avoid wearing dark colors as these will make you and your children blend in easily with the crowd and avoid putting your child s name on it this will make it easy for strangers to call them out and take your child with them bring along a way to communicate with your kids you can give older siblings a cellphone just make sure they know your number younger kids can benefit from the use of a walkie talkie to keep in touch with you should they get lost show them how to use it and explain that it is not a toy but a way to reunite if you do get separated find a place to designate as your meeting spot if someone from the group is separated once you arrive at the amusement park crowded commonly designated areas like the front gates of the park or at a bench next to a popular attraction are not good meeting spaces as they will be very crowded at all times of the day and relatively unsafe for a young child to be sitting at alone instead choose a less popular area to meet up like at the security booth or next to the restaurant where you plan to eat this will make it easier to find a lost child remember to stay together at all times you probably won t mind letting older kids go off on their own for a while as long as they keep in touch via cellphone but younger children should hold your hand and stay with you as you walk through the park keep a firm grip to prevent your child from slipping away in especially large crowded amusement parks i e walt disney world it might be better to safely fasten your child in a stroller or carrier instead of allowing them to walk lessening the chances of being separated don t panic in the event that your child does get lost or separated this may sound like a cliché that is sometimes impossible to remember but if you panic you are only worsening the situation stay collected and focused on what you need to do next also keep in mind that your child may not really be lost they may have simply slipped out of your grip and are following behind or are stopping to look at something if you have looked everywhere around you and absolutely cannot find them continue to the next step find the nearest employee or security officer and explain that your child is lost they will radio the security office to inform them that there is a lost child in the park give the employee or officer a complete description of your child what he or she looks like what he or she is wearing etc this will make it easier for them to locate your child tell them if there is a specific area that your child might be likely to go to such as a favorite ride or activity or a pre arranged meeting location take a picture of your child before going to the park dressed in the same clothes etc on your cellphone if possible you can show or share this with security personnel cooperate with the park security panicking or disagreeing with the security may land you in more frustration than you are in already they are experienced professionals trained to deal with this type of situation in fact they see similar situations hundreds of times a year stay where you are unless the park security instructs you otherwise your child may be nearby just hidden in the crowd and will most likely come back to you if they see where you are check the park s lost found center and see if you can find your child or young group member there many amusement parks have stations like these where employees who find lost children take them there are usually some activities there to keep your child occupied until they can be reunited with you their group in most cases your lost child or group member will be found by now if you have given the security a good description of them if hours pass and your child is still not found they will contact the local

to walk to the other side of the building following the path to get to the entrance of it reserve gwazi games for later or if you really like shooting arcades or similar palaces ride the hub and spoke

getting out at congo the platform is on a slight up grade walk towards the ride entrance for sheikra roll with the sheikra roller coaster although this roller coaster is popular and almost new it s

other article click the write an article button from any wikihow page and enter your proposed title get comfortable using either the advanced editor or article creation tool for articles like this guided editor doesn t allow for multiple sections so isn t suited to these kinds of detailed theme park walk throughs keep a current map of the park with ride names nearby as you write develop a list of action verbs that correspond to the type of rides in the park try to use action verbs that explain what the reader will be doing on the ride will they be going somewhere or just riding the ride watching a show or taking in an attraction use an impactful verb that sets the scene for the reader even if you have never ridden the ride or watched the attraction before get to know exactly what all attractions are like so that you can describe them thoroughly and in an interesting way use the introduction to get the reader psyched about visiting the park shoot for three to four sentences for an introduction as part of a paragraph to get the reader intrigued and interested in what you have to tell them set the scene for the reader in the steps section start by giving the reader some facts about the park including the address of the park as well as other nearby park choices they might consider visiting remember to cite reputable sources try both bing and google to get a mix of solid

is positioned in each of these lands write about each item from your map and notes as if you were walking from place to place through the park get the reader psyched to know just what to expect as they go through the park you can use subsections to divide your article up by lands sections just as the park is divided up if you aren t sure where the entrances and exits are you can still lead the reader through the main attractions in an order that makes sense parks not divided into individual lands can be set up as if the reader walks from one end of the park to the other along one path side and then back along the other side set the scene for each ride show shop and restaurant but avoid spoilers as much as possible if you can t include them all make sure to mention the most famous ones

specialty pass or stay at their exclusive hotel install queue apps on your mobile device there s many apps available that updates you on how long a queue is at that specific time and can be very useful for popular rides use the appropriate dress codes most theme parks have a dress codes and standards including wearing footwear at all times and ensuring clothing has non offensive messages if a theme park has water rides be sure to carry or have an extra shirt around if you don t want to walk around in wet clothes if you are drenched ensure that you are dry before getting on a non water ride to avoid getting seats wet there s nothing worse than waiting in line and sitting on a moist seat because the person before you was wet have a family friendly mind set when going to theme parks most theme parks have developed over the years to aim to accommodate families and people of all ages know what you will enjoy and be considerate of those enjoying anything that you might be too mature for control your language around others while having fun with friends your mind might lock into laid back and every day conversations limit or avoid the usage of profanity in queue lines as kids can pick up words easily research if the park has exclusive smoking areas just being in the open air doesn t mean you are allowed to light a cigarette whenever you want to secondhand smoke exposure not only creates potentially serious health issues to others but it is a top park annoyance have control over your children theme parks can be super exciting place for young ones but it is not their personal playground teach your child to wait patiently in lines or give them something little to kill time play hand games with them play i spy or have them check out any decorations you find in the queue line never allow your child to swing from the posts kick thrust their feet which might trip other people in the next lane or to run around others hold their hand at all times while walking from ride to ride children may want to walk on their own safety precautions must be taken into account to avoid bumping into the elderly strollers adults as well as avoid getting lost and going too far away from their parents treat the pathway like a road paying attention is crucial and can make or break someone s enjoyment especially in large crowds veer to the extreme side if you need to stop in a pathway abruptly stopping to look at a map take a picture or to look behind you to find family members or friends is another top annoyance avoid using the entire pathway for your family it s very common and recommended to hold each other s hands but if you are in a large group prepare to break up into small groups so others can get through properly avoid looking at your phone while walking not knowing where you are walking is guaranteed to make you bump into others don t make mad rushes or dashes to your favorite ride accidentally swinging arms or trampling over someone because you want to make it into a queue line before others is disrespectful turn your camera flash off flashes are not only a huge annoyance to other visitors but to employees or workers whom are performing in an event there are lots of rides that prohibit flash photography and people will be advised of the rules before getting on when using flash photography in dark rides one might expose machinery or other hidden items sporadic flashes also takes the fun out of rides use proper hygiene in hot conditions body odors in a crowd come out and it can be nauseous to many if you are planning to stay at a nearby hotel plan on going back in the middle of the day to take a shower and change clothes so you feel and smell refreshed later on avoid using excessive perfumes or body sprays as this also makes people nauseous avoid complaining about prices parks tend to have high prices for items such as souvenirs food and drinks many parks allow you to bring your own water bottle think about dining at outside food establishments or restaurants before entering the park don t be enticed to purchase items at kiosks or gift shops just because something catches your eye you might find that item or something better while shopping online or at another store stay with your group in queue lines line cutting or line saving gives a negative impact on people behind whom have waiting in line themselves there s a huge difference between saving a space for someone whom physically can t stand on their feet for a long duration and saving a space for people who naturally want to join their friends and family,Arts-and-Entertainment

tunnel crawls and play spaces for even smaller children get a reservation for dining with shamu or dining with dolphins dining events these are both buffet styled events and therefore will tend to be busy so be sure to get there rather early or when these animals are not planning to be participating in their shows the shows are training sessions for these animals so don t expect large waves while you eat go to any restaurant if you can t reserve for dining with shamu or the dolphins there are many other restaurants that you shouldn t need table reservations for but for an example if you want

you in a better physical and mental state to fully enjoy the experience wake up at an appropriate time on the day of your visit to avoid a last minute rush and panic make sure you give yourself plenty of time to get ready if you are going to the park for the first time allow plenty of time to catch the right bus or if you plan to drive give yourself plenty of time to navigate to the theme park being rushed and in a hurry will result in you getting flustered and will not get your visit off on the right track giving yourself time in the morning will allow you to double check your luggage you intend taking to the park try to have an early entry if you want to squeeze the maximum value out of your day consider pre purchasing an early entry pass for just ten dollars more per ticket you will be able to enter the park one hour earlier than usual visitors during peak periods this may be well worth it as you can grab a few rides before the masses arrive queue virtually one way to avoid queuing is to pre purchase a q4u device having a q4u means you can reserve a place in the queue then go and do something else and return at the time your q4u has reserved and jump straight onto the ride the cost of a q4u is about 30 extra for a family of four and can be used on eight bookable rides enjoy your day according to your plan which can be modified and changed on the day if you plan on spending the full day at the park and even into the evening don t be in a hurry to follow the crowds most visitors depart the park around three to three thirty pm so after this time wait times are considerably less be safe despite being very safe dreamworld is a big theme park covering a large area in the bustling crowds and excitement of the day it is very easy for kids to race off to the next attraction or ride lay down the ground rules if you are travelling with children and have a lost plan in the event that somebody gets lost this could be to simply make your way to a certain place or ride to meet up again eat lunch outside the normal lunch hours of eleven till two many of the food outlets can become just as crowded as the rides during busy days if your visit is on a hot sunny day remember to drink plenty of fluids and make sure your children do too and wear a hat in direct sunlight secure a good location if there is a show that you d really like to see then get to the location about fifteen minutes before the show starts especially on peak days this will secure the best views if you have a medical condition seek your doctor s advice about going on terrifying rides check height requirements are you high enough many of the more frightening rides have height restrictions so to avoid on the day disappointment when a child learns they cannot ride the ride they want to ride check in advance as to what rides have height restrictions and what they are and whether your child will be affected if a child is not the required height then they don t get on the ride it s a simple as that consider going to whitewater world if you plan to combine your visit to dreamworld with a visit to the adjacent whitewater world park then consider purchasing a world pass a world pass will enable you to travel freely between the two theme parks through an interconnected central gate although dreamworld prohibits bringing food into the park it is ok to do so at whitewater world this means that if you have a world pass you can bring your lunch etc eat it in whitewater world then visit dreamworld if you drive to the theme park don t be in any hurry to leave when everyone else does imagine ten thousand vehicles trying to leave anywhere at the same time and you ll get the picture alternatively surfside buses run a regular service and the quickest service to coomera train station and the gold coast obey the rules and regulations on each ride and be considerate to others put your trash in the bins provided make your day a memorable one with a well planned out day know when you can t go dreamworld is open every day except xmas day and anzac day morning april 25th,Arts-and-Entertainment

that cedar point has cool 60 degree weather all season long don t make that mistake temperatures recorded near cedar point have reached 90 f 32 2 c and above multiple times an example of a good cedar point outfit is a pair of cargo shorts to carry stuff 2 x research source a loose t shirt no show socks and tennis shoes many people make the mistake of bringing only one outfit for every day they spend at cedar point skip this common amateur mistake if you accidentally spill ice cream on yourself or get your clothes soaking wet on snake river falls beyond what the family dryers can resolve you re going to want that second outfit however in the unlikely event that the cedar point forecast showcases the luxurious 60 degree weather described above this usually happens during the fall season halloweekends bringing a light sweater or jacket will save you a lot of time and money at the gift shop during the day bring a swimsuit if you will have the opportunity to go to cedar point shores or the beach if you came many years ago and went to soak city the park s waterpark it has been updated into the new and improved cedar point shores if you think you will have the opportunity to go for a swim or a ride on one of the waterslides bring your swimsuit even if you don t end up going in the water that s much better than being able to go swimming and not having proper swimwear bring toiletries like dental products but leave other things like shampoo and towels at home cedar point s on site beachfront resort hotel breakers which is the most popular and in most people s opinions the most luxurious hotel to book during your stay includes things such as shampoo and towels 3 x research source so you re better off leaving those things at home however you will obviously still need things like dental products lotion and antiperspirant if you are a woman and you know that your trip is during that time of month don t forget feminine hygiene products like pads and tampons public bathrooms throughout the park may have product dispensers but don t count on it come prepared and enjoy your trip more avoid bringing much else other than your clothing with everything cedar point has to offer it s unlikely that you will be spending much idle time in your hotel room with the exception of early mornings and late nights as such don t bring any activity sets or games of any sort unless they were for a car ride or plane ride make sure that everything you will carry around with you throughout your day is portable you will most likely need only your phone your credit card your

carry things in cargo shorts as stated in earlier steps avoid bringing food with you in the park unless someone you are traveling with has special dietary needs cedar point is extremely strict about

save on potentially overpriced drinks with this exception in addition to no outside food you also cannot take alcoholic drinks purchased in the park home with you so think twice before bringing home that amazing cocktail you wanted to give to your friend there are picnic shelters throughout the park but they are on a first come first served basis visiting them just to eat your ham sandwich will likely take away a lot of valuable time that could be spent riding valravn plan your travel it wouldn t make sense to fly directly to cedar point except if you live outside of the continent of north america the best way to travel to the park is to take a car make sure you decide who will be driving the day before your visit so you can avoid any long disputes that delay your travel you could also

beginning of the season when you are preparing for your visit consider investing in a season pass or platinum pass the lines for photos for your season pass aren t usually desirable but it will save you a lot of time and money especially if you want to come back more than once in a single season avoid staying up late the night before you plan to leave for the park cedar point s summer hours are usually 10am to 10pm 5 x research source and if you have platinum pass you are able to go to a handful of rides one hour earlier than the general public even if you are celebrating a special occasion the night before your trip going to bed at around 9 30 is helpful but even earlier if you need to wake up early to get to cedar point understand that some of your friends may be less or more roller

make some sacrifices if you have kids in your group you may not get to ride top thrill dragster if your four year old is begging to go on snoopy bounce respect the limits of kids if possible travel with more than one adult so that one of you can take them on smaller rides while the other rides more thrilling coasters refrain from line jumping line jumping will get you kicked out of the park

how to enjoy carnival in panama safely,celebrating carnival in panama can be a great time but there are a few steps to keep in mind in order to enjoy it safely by taking a few precautions you can ensure you have the best experience possible,find a local parade by talking to your friends and neighbors or simply go into panama city or penanome and watch one in progress there are many impromptu events going on in panama all over the country do your research where are the parades where are the tipicos do you have any panamanian friends you can go with or a crowd of people you can go with to stay safer and more protected if you do take advantage of that and join a group rather than go alone you are a greater target when you are alone especially if you re female this is simply a male based society so if you re female you have to be a bit more careful wear very comfortable clothing make sure you can walk and stand in your shoes for extended periods of time without discomfort it gets hot consider taking your car buses are extremely crowded and it is often difficult to find one that is not full there are people who wait as long as two hours to catch a bus different cities have different vibes for families penanome is great for singles panama city as is the beach consider visiting coronado or chame for an lgbt friendly location go to las tables the further in the interior you go the more celebrations you will find the wealthy tend to go to the beach it s very expensive and prestigious the average person tends to go into the interior do not wear high heels all day the roads and sidewalks are not smooth they are uneven and bumpy and the perfect way to twist an ankle and fall or worse wear comfortable shoes that you can go anywhere in do not put your wallet in your back pocket when you have your wallet in your back pocket it s very easy for someone to grab it and run buy one of those belts or wrist bands with hidden pockets and only carry a small amount of cash and one credit card don t forget the copy of your passport in panama the police can stop you any time and ask for your passport if you don t have it they can give you a very expensive ticket any photocopy of your passport must include your entry stamp too this is especially important when you drive because you can only drive in panama on a visitors permit for three months be cautious with jewelry avoid wearing anything expensive especially necklaces which can be grabbed and broken while the thief passes by and with the crowds so thick trying to find someone who robbed you can be impossible avoid large bags that stick out from your body if you re a woman wear a purse that is small and a crossbody so that it can be worn so that it s tucked under your arm if it has a metal strap all the better that makes it harder to break or cut drink a lot of water it s very easy to get caught up in the dancing and excitement and stop drinking water drink more than usual because of the heat and increased activity you will feel better have less muscle soreness and just generally be able to be out longer even if you re primarily drinking alcohol because it is a party after all switch out and make every other drink water one glass of alcohol one glass of water it will help you stay hydrated but it will also help you so that you don t get so drunk watch your surroundings especially when drinking it can be very peligroso or dangerous to be intoxicated in a strange place with people you don t know it s important to stay aware of your surroundings and keep safe be ready for the carnival customs like egg throwing as part of carnival people will randomly throw eggs often mixed with water and dirt on you indiscriminately it s not personal it s a custom and one you may not want to partake in if you re aware of your surroundings you can often avoid being a victim also close your car windows in certain areas when you see people with eggs they will throw them in your car be sure to duck if anyone throws something at you this custom is expected by panamanians americans may not be quite so enthusiastic however if it appeals to you by all means partake be aware that parades include being sprayed by water you may want to wear a swimsuit under your clothing or consider wearing a swimsuit with shorts or a skirt many women wear them out during the day rather than regular clothes at night it s more dressy but still a tradition to be sprayed by water so be careful,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to choose a school carnival theme,school carnivals are usually thrown every year these steps can help you get organized before you prepare your own school s carnival,ask permission you will need to ask for permission before you start planning any event for a school be sure that the school authority knows about your plans and accepts you as a planning participant you can talk to the school principal for more information form a council carnivals are difficult to organize on your own you will need to form a council or party planning committee to help with the ideas and setup for your school carnival invite people to join the council and offer the more motivated persons enticing roles with plenty of room for people to innovate and use their initiative also bear in mind that you ll need some guidelines or checklists for people who prefer to just do as they re asked make use of existing ideas for carnival themes while brainstorming is great see next step having some ideas to put on the table to get the ball rolling will help jog everyone s imagination here are some possible carnival theme ideas to begin with that you can either use modify or just throw in for the brainstorming a foodie festival all things related to baking barbecuing preserving cooking etc a sideshow style carnival have small rides lots of games prize winning competitions etc an animal theme have a petting zoo base games and tables on animal themes have the children wear animal costumes etc an art theme display the student s artwork everywhere and have an artistic flavor to all of the stalls games rides etc brainstorm together with your council formed you can begin brainstorming ideas do not reject any ideas initially instead take all of them on board and use these ideas to generate more ideas once you have quite a few on the table you can then go around the table and get people to select their top 10 ideas then reduce it to the top five and start voting for the best theme make use of online suggestions for carnivals to help visualize what the carnival could be set up a screen projection that can beam out internet pages to the council as they re seated around the table then do image searches for such topics as carnivals bazaars fetes school fairs etc and see what is returned the many images that return for your different searches will help to inspire the brainstorming tremendously be attuned to the school s makeup be aware of the backgrounds of the students and seek to choose a theme that is culturally acceptable that ensures the carnival is inclusive if the carnival takes place during the holiday season you may want to do a christmas theme or a broader holiday theme that can also account for hannukah kwanzaa etc seasonal carnivals can remove the focus on any single cultural or religious theme to the festival for example if the carnival takes place during the spring season you may want to do an outdoor theme that involves sports and games consider whether items can be purchased hired or need to be made when selecting a theme as these can increase cost and impact on people s time and resources they are an important determining factor for the theme for example if the council wants to run a sideshow theme but it s clear that hiring the rides will be too costly you can either decide to focus only on games that can be set up using school property or you might even change the theme altogether to one that has lower cost implications choose a location research on the hours of your carnival site as well as the activities that your site offers make sure that allows for date and time reservations as well as the purchasing of tickets either online or at the doors set a budget carnivals cost money and time form a budget with the money you have earned for this event you will need to find stores that can sell you decorations and rent you carnival equipment these can be found locally anywhere in your town have some helpers who can take inventory of everything you purchased and keep track of all equipment used set a date you must have a date set for your carnival be sure to get the word out send the students home with flyers and invitations and make sure that the community knows about the theme as well as the benefit of your cause decide on the time that your carnival starts as well as the time that it is over try to pick the least busy time possible purchase your supplies be sure that you have a list of everything in your budget purchase all your decorations a few days before the carnival if there is any rented equipment you will need to schedule this a few weeks prior to the actual carnival event decorate now that you have all your supplies and equipment it is time to set it up have your group set up everything before the guests arrive you should be able to set everything up within 6 7 hours if everything was prepared properly be sure to know where everything is to be placed prior to setting up,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to rebuild zipper carnival ride brake calipers,too many times the seal will give way in the zipper ride s brake system leaking brake fluid all over the scenery shutting the ride down until proper repairs have been done just as often the maintenance person does not know how to rebuild the caliper sets so when the calipers are put back into service another mess and more down time for the ride the following directions will take you through the proper procedures to follow when rebuilding the caliper sets,place brake casing into a soft jawed vise with end plug 6 in a vertical position note that clamping should be done at the sides of the caliper on the machined surfaces remove bleeder screws 19 using a 7 16 socket and ratchet or box end wrench if a combination wrench is used do not use the open end of the wrench because it may strip the flats before loosening the bleeder screw remove hex nut 1 from compensator assembly 9 using a ½ socket remove belleville spring 2 wedge ring 3 washer 4 and o ring 5 from compensator assembly 9 using a spanner wrench remove end plug 6 from housing 18 when removing the end plug 6 from the housing the compensator assembly should remain in the piston if it comes out with the end plug this indicates that it had been assembled improperly remove piston 10 and lining 11 assembly from housing bore remove flat head screws 12 to separate lining 11 and piston 10 save the lining for future use for replacement of worn linings which does not require full disassembly this lining is still reusable however notice the quantity of rust and exfoliation which has accumulated between the piston and the lining this rust as it built up actually caused pressure and contributed to the shearing of the upper right hand screw before this lining can be reused it must be cleaned of all these oxide deposits taking great care not to disrupt the ridge at the bottom where the lining seats into the piston this area is where all of the braking force is exerted and the aluminum screws will not shear if it is seated properly any movement of the lining in the piston under braking pressure will result in the screws being sheared notice that the right hand screw has been broken off notice as well the excessive amount of rust buildup under where the old lining had seated this rust has allowed moisture to collect under the lining assembly accelerating the corrosion process weakening the aluminum screw due to galvanic effects resulting in the screw having been sheared off before the new lining is assembled to this piston the rust must be thoroughly removed sealant will be applied to the new lining to act as a seal and adhesive and new screws will be installed never reuse old screws remove compensator assembly 9 from piston 10 using an 11 16 open end wrench notice the use of a folded rag in the jaws of the vise to prevent damage to the piston when the compensator assembly has been removed carefully inspect the threads for damage making sure that all old locktite material has been removed from the threads remove o ring 8 and backup ring 7 from end plug 6 using a thin blade tool or a pick tool remove backup ring 14 o ring 13 and seal 15 from housing bore remove flat head screws 16 and lining 17 from housing bore inspect the housing bore contact area for corrosion and remove any which may be present if the lining is in good shape clean and set it aside as spare parts to be reused in the event that anther lining wears out at this time do not reuse the old linings because new ones are provided with the rebuild kit this end plug is not reusable notice in the photo to the left that the center hole has been crushed by impact with a hammer or other object and in the photo to the right the edge where the o ring and backup ring installs has severe pitting corrosion the new pressure compensator will no longer fit into the center hole and the new o ring and backup ring will not make a proper seal against the pits left from the corrosion the end plug in the photos to the left is reusable and if properly cleaned will provide long service notice the white powdery substance along the perimeter of the threads this is the anodizing which has been attacked by filiform corrosion the anodizing or gold coloration was applied to act as a sacrificial anode and the white powdery substance is the produce after corrosive attack this is normal and if the corrosion has not pitted the groove where the o ring and backup ring seat it will be all right however due to the fact that the protective anodizing has been compromised the bare steel will now corrode under corrosive attack and protective measures need to be undertaken using a mild wire brush and brake parts cleaner or any other solvent which does not contain petroleum distillates such as electrical parts cleaner naptha or isopropyl alcohol thoroughly clean the entire end plug assembly if using a flammable substance such as naphtha or isopropyl alcohol be sure to work in a well ventilated area well away from sparks or flames and for safety s sake have a safety observer with a co2 fire extinguisher standing nearby using a rounded object in this instance a 6 ratchet extension and 400 to 600 grit emery cloth clean out the inside of the end plug this area is where the pressure compensator makes its seal and travel occurs within this area as the piston travels outward during normal liner wear normally there is a small area of wear where the anodizing has been worn away with rust or oxide deposits in this area if there is deep pitting in the wear area the end plug cannot be reused or leakage will occur past the pits use a folded rag to protect the machined surfaces from damage by the jaws of the vise note that brake fluid eats paint if it is left on a painted surface too long and if brake fluid comes into contact with a customer s clothing made of polymers it will destroy them just as well when using a cylinder hone to clean out the bore of the housing be careful not to hone down the threads inside the housing also use the finest possible grit stone that can be obtained normally only glaze breakers are available from most auto parts stores if a coarse glaze breaker has to be used first smear grease onto the stones so that the fine oxides removed from the inside of the housing will fill the pores of the stones and make less abrasive doing this means that in the future these stones will only be good for polishing and honing so keep them separate from other stones used for rougher abrasive work the finished product should be as close to mirror like as possible when done if there are obvious signs of scratching from the hone it is too rough and should be used on something else to wear it down and smooth it more before final polishing of the housing adding grease will close the pores of the stones with the materials removed for quickly wearing down a glaze breaker to smoother polishing a piece of pipe a tin can or other rounded steel item can be used it is easier to just purchase the proper stones in the first place because any scratches put into the housing will have to be removed before going on with reassembly since usually one or more of the fastening screws for the lining will be sheared off now the sheared off portion of the screw needs to be drilled out these are 10 24 screws so use a 25 drill bit to drill these out and follow with a 10 24 tap to clean the threads if the proper size drill bit is not available do not substitute for any other size these parts are expensive and a 25 drill bit is very cheap do not use a 5 32 drill bit just because it is close to the same size and do not go to a smaller size drill bit because the likelihood that the tap will break is increased when tapping the holes out when drilling the holes put the housing or piston in a vise so that it will not move and make sure that you drill straight down through the hole using both hands and keeping the drill steady if it is a piston which is being drilled use folded rags to protect the outer surface and test its stability in the vise before beginning to drill to make sure the vise is tight enough and the piston will not swivel sideways in the jaws it is much more preferable to use a drill press but sometimes they are not available use a 3 8 drill capable of at least 900 to 1000 rpm do not use a ½ drill most ½ drills are too slow in rpm and have such high torque that they might break the drill bit off on breakthrough use a sharp drill bit start the drill at high speed but with very little downward pressure so it can start its way through the aluminum of the screw and very slowly let the drill bit do all the work run a tap through the holes to clean out the threads if drilling has been done the old thread material needs to be removed this thread material should be of aluminum if someone in the past has not put steel screws into the part aluminum has a tendency to clog up the tap so a lot of back and forth tapping should be done turn the tap in just a little then back it almost all the way out again never putting more than just the minimum of torque on it each time it is turned in this is a long tedious process but if performed in this manner it will prevent the tap from binding in the steel and breaking when running the tap through the housing the tap is traveling through almost ¾ of steel and there is a very high likelihood of binding use the tee handle in the tap set for this and use wrist action to twist do not use both hands on either handle as some persons prefer to do by using wrist action and one hand it makes sure that too much torque is not applied and helps keep the torque straight down the axis of the tap reducing the chance of breakage if the tap breaks off inside the piston or the housing then you have just ruined a very expensive part before installing the new lining into the housing first double check to make sure the mating surface of the housing is well cleaned of all rust and debris if necessary scraping it will help followed by a small wire brush and brake cleaner to remove all traces of oil and dirt mask off all the areas where paint will not be applied and prime the area where the lining seats to protect it from corroding again set the housing aside for the paint to dry while working on the piston and compensator assembly carefully install new back up ring 7 and o ring 8 over non threaded end of plug 6 and into groove make sure they are installed in proper position in groove,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to evaluate the safety of pop up carnival rides,most carnival rides are well maintained and have good safety histories however to be on the safe side there are steps you can take to ensure a fun

they might be cutting corners when it comes to safety check the grounds for excessive litter and for unhealthy conditions at areas where they serve food if you see a staff member pass by a piece of trash they might not be concerned with ride maintenance or other safety issues 1 x research source check rides for wear surface cracks and weld imperfections notice rusting and other signs of wear especially at critical areas that seem to be load bearing or essential to the ride s operation avoid rides with cracks in any surfaces or improperly welded joints steer clear if you notice anything that looks like a quick fix like a patch of metal that doesn t match the rest of the ride s structure 2 x research source watch the rides for repeated smooth operation make sure the ride moves the same way every time it operates look for both smooth repetitive motions in addition to a particular section where it jumps halts or does something that seems wrong to you 3 x research source keep in mind the differences between how rides are built a wooden roller coaster is built with a bit of flexibility to account for the wood framework so it s okay for it to sway a bit however a steel coaster s structure should never sway at all listen for signs of poor maintenance typically you shouldn t be able to hear grinding screeching or other signs of improper lubrication or poor maintenance if you hear something that concerns you try to pay attention to what the ride is doing at the time 4 x trustworthy source state of indiana official site for state approved sources related to life in indiana including laws services and culture go to source does a screech seem to indicate bad brakes as a cart comes to a stop do you hear metal on metal wearing that might be compromising the ride s integrity ask a ride operator about your concerns ask them when the ride was last inspected if they can t give you any adequate explanations ask them to direct you to park management notice if carnival workers are attentive pay attention to the ride operators and try to evaluate their level of competency do they seem professional or are they reading a magazine while the ride is in motion if you bring any safety concerns to their attention do they show concern or shake off your question 5 x trustworthy source state of indiana official site for state approved sources related to life in indiana including

seem knowledgeable about the ride they re operating you might want to skip out on that ride or stick to the carnival s games and other amusements check for proper safety signage most jurisdictions require that carnivals post safety precautions such as you must be this certain height to go on this ride 6 x research source look for these postings and for the carnival s operating permit depending on your jurisdiction the carnival may also be required to post permits and inspection certificates for each ride 7 x research source you can search online to find out if your state or other locality requires individual ride permits search your local government s public safety webpage using the keywords amusement park ride operating permit make sure the ride has proper safety restraints while you re in line check ahead to be sure other guests have no issues with safety harnesses and belts if you observe any complaints of loose restraints or dissatisfaction you should skip the ride if it comes to be your turn and everything you ve seen so far checks out make sure your own restraints fit snugly and lock into place 8 x research source speak up if you have any concerns before the ride starts when you harness yourself in be sure you fit into the ride s seat and the harness locks around you comfortably pay particular attention if your proportions are especially large or small if you have any trouble at all be sure to shout out for assistance to the operator before they start the ride 9 x research source follow all posted safety instructions avoid rides that specify proportions that aren t right for your body if there are height or age restrictions don t sneak on or try to sneak your child keep your arms inside the cart or other relevant ride capsule 10 x trustworthy source state

how to get a job as a character at disney,being a disney character every dream come true imagine being paid to dress up and be a part of the magic walking around as your favorite character signing autographs putting on shows and having children scream when they see you awesome since disney is all over the place they re constantly looking for performers why can t the next one be you,find an audition go to the website www disneyauditions com to see a list of upcoming auditions they re held all over the place though you ll have the most luck in california or florida each one is different so think carefully about what you d like to do look carefully because each audition is looking for something in particular parade performers male comedic actors look alikes etc you may need to travel to find the audition you re really looking for you shouldn t show up to a mad tea party audition even if you re jasmine s doppelganger unless you want to sip tea with alice each audition is open you simply need to check in early the day of the audition they may fill up however so the only thing you absolutely need to do is be prompt make sure you meet the requirements most disney characters have a specific look even if you re not one of the faces you gotta fit the suit after all mickey minnie and other fully outfitted characters have less strict guidelines but guidelines nonetheless for example princesses can t be above 5 7 and you gotta be at least 18 and under 27 though that rule is technically unwritten there s a physique look too obviously characters without full suits must look like their character those in suits must fit in it comfortably it all depends on who you re playing and you may be assigned to play several in general disney prefers their faces not to have distinguishable features for example if cinderella has a huge mole on her face one day and then it is gone the next children may get suspicious that s just how it is assemble your headshot and resume it s best to have your headshot prepared on normal letter paper with either your resume directly printed on back or attached make sure it s crisp and new and everything is up to date if you have blonde hair in your headshot but blue hair in real life they may consider it all out of date you want to give the best first impression possible if you don t already have a headshot and resume get on that find a friend that s a blooming photographer and ask them if you can be a free guinea pig then get on a quick internet search to see what your resume should look like it s not that daunting of a process if you get on it now prepare your necessary pieces for each type of audition you ll need a way to prove your chops it s all fairly logical for a singing audition prepare 16 bars of a song acting a monologue comedy brush up on your improv musician a selection of three pieces to show your versatility basically bring your a game for whatever the audition calls for it s always good to have a back up too you don t want to see the three girls in front of you all singing good morning baltimore knowing that s your song too always always always have a back up if you re looking to be a specific character study the movie if you can bust out snow white at a moment s notice the judges are bound to be impressed work on your flexibility and dance skills you don t need to be a professional dancer but a background and experience in choreography helps so get to work on those split stretches and have your dancer friend teach you a few bits beyond that jazz square you ve been whipping out at all those weddings every little bit helps be careful in stretching if you over stretch especially when your muscles are cold you could hurt yourself and have less flexibility for the day of the audition always exercise caution when it comes to your body get a good night s sleep you want to be fully rested and raring to go for the morning of the audition your nerves will probably be on high alert so do your body as many favors as you can by getting a full 8 hours of sleep if you re lacking any energy it ll be tough to give it your all while you re at it eat a decent normal breakfast you don t want to eat anything too different in case it upsets your stomach but do eat something substantial enough to get you through the morning you could be waiting a long time check in early registration will open up an hour or two beforehand just to be safe you ll want to get there on the early side of that you can then take time to stretch calm down and size up your competition they ll ask you for your headshot and resume and direct you to a place where you can wait wait and then wait some more once you get there only auditioners will be allowed in so your family cheerleaders may have to go on their merry way once you re in hey this way you can make friends bring comfortable gear and water you ll probably be doing some sort of movement even if it isn t technically dance though it could be dance so make sure you re wearing something comfortable do not dress as the character you are auditioning for auditioning for ariel wearing a mermaid s tail can only lose you points if you re not looking to be any type of dancer they ll probably have you doing improvised scenes this is where you mime anything from packing a suitcase to experiencing ice cream the first time to chasing after the guy who stole your hat you could be running around quite ferociously it may take a while and you may get a little thirsty so bring your own bottle of water and whatever else you may need chapstick anyone wait sometimes these things take ages especially if there s hundreds of you they can only take so many people at once so you may siphoned off into a waiting room more than once be friendly and positive you never know who might have some pull rock it whatever your audition is be it busting out a song or doing pirouettes down the hallway rock it be confident and remember to smile you got this you re prepared you re just as good as everyone else here if you re in auditions for a specific character just be conscious of not dropping it they re looking for someone who s this person in mind body and spirit every little quirk every little movement has to be this character it s no longer you it s how cinderella would pack a suitcase it s how goofy would pirouette down the hallway from the tips of your fingers to the tips of your toes you are this character the first part of the audition will be the dance unless you re in a musician s audition although it is not very complicated if you are unable to master the dance you will not be able to continue to the second part of the audition after the dance the judges will give you a scene they would like you to act out eg goofy getting decorating a christmas tree you getting your favorite dessert and then wait some more judging can take a while after the audition it is pretty much a waiting game and that s about it trust that they ll get a hold of you that you wrote down your phone number and email correctly and that you ll know the verdict in time start your training great you made it now it s time to start training this will probably be around a week s time you ll have different expectations depending on your role or roles received if you re a prominent character from a movie they ll ask you to know the movie and your character like the back of your hand we re talking quoting the entire thing from memory back of your hand how they move and interact too if you re a suited character they ll have you concentrating more on mannerisms and the handwriting after all if a child gets two goofy autographs they gotta look the same be your character at all times all times they have to be animated and brought to life even when it seems like no one s looking though someone is always looking that means when a child asks you pocahontas what your opinion on the internet is you must respond with inter net what is this internet of which you speak young one even if they say hey look goofy goofy is not in your world that s a talking dog woah disney can get pretty serious about this from your words to frowning too much they can get on you about it of all the rules this is the most important and it makes sense if you don t keep up the magic you ll ruin it for the kids who have been waiting their entire lives to experience the disney magic play by the rules apart from the above golden rule there are a whole bunch of other ones too no sitting strict break times no saying no to pictures or autographs etc and so forth so play nice and listen to em most of them are there for a reason unfortunately being a disney character isn t all fun and games no job is the pay isn t phenomenal you get to dress up isn t that incentive enough and there s a definite pecking order a la mean girls faces before furs but many workers say that even after months or years of working there they still feel the disney magic be magical at the end of the day you are creating something beautiful for the people at the park the children there truly believe they re in a magical wonderful place and they are it can be the happiest place on earth relish the moments you have being a part of it you probably won t ever have another job like it,Arts-and-Entertainment

of your trip but you might be too tired to visit more than 1 park per day anyway 20 x research source for instance a 4 day 1 park per day ticket during the slow season starts at 434 per adult and 416 per child aged 3 to 9 years of age a 4 day park hopper ticket is 525 for each adult and 506 for each child for a family of four getting the single park per day tickets instead of the park hopper

order early enough you can have your tickets shipped to your house before your trip or you can download e tickets and print them directly from your email you can get tickets cheaper on various different websites too keep an eye out for deals disney will occasionally run promotions that add an extra day to a multi day ticket at no cost know what you re buying if you only want to go to disneyland park not california adventure there s no need to buy a parkhopper ticket simply purchase a one park ticket if you plan on parking at disneyland you can buy your parking pass online as well get to the park early early morning is the perfect time of day at the park it s mostly empty temperatures are cool and the kids are still happy you can get fastpasses and knock out a few of the popular rides before the crowds get crazy people start to queue up at the park gates about an hour before opening if you want to do the fantasyland rides do them in the morning before all the families show up the lines will never be shorter use fastpasses the system can seem a little intimidating at first but it s easier than it looks and worth skipping the standby lines here s a quick rundown on how the system works you can get new fastpasses every 90 minutes dispatch someone to get your first round as soon as you walk into the park he or she will need to take everyone s park tickets along if you re not sure when 90 minutes is up the next time you can get fastpasses will be printed at the bottom of your most recent ones each ride that allows fastpass use will have a little fastpass station with four to eight fastpass machines you stick one ticket at a time into the machine and it will spit out a paper fastpass below that has a one hour window of time printed on it they have to be used on the day you got them once you have your fastpasses and the first time printed has passed you walk up to the fastpass line instead of the standby line which should be clearly marked for each ride the person at the front will check your passes to make sure they are valid then you hang onto them and give them to a second person at the end of the line fastpass times are now being enforced if your ticket says 1 45 to 2 45 you must show up between those times some popular rides will run out of fastpasses if you really want to fastpass space mountain indiana jones the haunted mansion during halloween christmas or astroblasters do it early in the day some of the other rides that utilize the fastpass service like big thunder mountain railroad or splash mountain will have short lines at the end of the day anyway and you won t need fastpasses eat wisely and well food inside the park can be expensive especially if you re feeding a family though there are some unique dining experiences you can try here s a rundown of what might work for you eat meals earlier than usual or after the mad lunch rush of 11am 2pm and the equally mad dinner rush between 6 30 8 00pm this way you can go on rides while everyone is eating and avoid lines when you re ready to eat be warned that new orleans square eateries have the worst lines head over to frontierland or critter country for shorter lines if you re eating cheaply pack lunch and dinner and stash your meals inside a locker near the park entrance there are plenty of tables around the park for you to sit and eat and picnicking on tom sawyer island can be a good way to cool off in the afternoon if you do need to buy food in the park fruit is generally cheap and portions at the fast casual eateries are large enough to split between two people make advance reservations for any full service dining there are only a few sit down restaurants inside disneyland such as the blue bayou and cafe orleans but they fill up quickly if it s really important to you to eat at these places make an advance reservation with disney dining at 714 781 3463 plan ahead with character dining character dining is offered at the plaza inn where costumed characters will roam the restaurant to take pictures and interact with guests as they eat this is an easy way to get some character time if you have kids but it tends to be expensive and fill up quickly your best bet is to make reservations in advance at 714 781 3463 bring food and games for long waits and to save money not all rides have fastpasses and waiting is inevitable and it will save you a bunch of money bags of cereal popcorn granola bars grapes and peanut butter jelly sandwiches are great to pack along with a ds or ipod decide when to buy souvenirs as with eating there are a few different ways to manage souvenir shopping depending on your needs here are a few possible game plans if you want to wear the famous mouse ears or any other headgear consider buying them at the beginning of the day so they ll be in all your photos if you re not sure what you want pass through a few souvenir shops during the heat of the day or when you need a break if something catches your eye return to buy it as you walk out of the park so that you don t need to carry it around all day if you have little ones and you re concerned about souvenir whining try this trick buy disney souvenirs less expensively online and pack them with you the night before you go to disneyland arrange your kids souvenirs as if mickey came and left them overnight like santa they already have new fun things to play with and you don t have to worry about shopping at the park problem solved know where to find characters if you have kids seeing costumed characters is probably high on your list of things to do though characters used to roam freely around the park they re now found at designated areas if you want to get character autographs make sure you have a pen big enough for the characters to grasp they won t be able to maneuver a small ballpoint pen as easily as a large marker visit toontown for an audience with mickey or minnie visit their houses inside toontown be prepared to wait in lines though other costumed characters should be wandering around toontown as well visit the princess fantasy faire if you want a picture with a princess this is pretty much the only place to get one try to go early since the wait can be up to 2 hours on peak days to get to the faire walk toward it s a small world turn left and keep walking past the toontown gate or you can simply take the disneyland railroad to the toontown stop visit pixie hollow pixie hollow is another area with specialized characters located between the astro orbiter and the matterhorn as with the princess faire the lines can be long wait at the secret character gate to snag characters as they enter the park from backstage wait at the gate in the northeast corner of main street between the main street cinema and great moments with mr lincoln characters will periodically appear here to pose for photos and sign autographs there is also one between the main street camera shop and the plaza inn and one next to the bathroom that is off the hub and outside of tomorrowland go to alice and the mad hatter s musical chairs at refreshment corner at the end of main street although only little ones can play this is a fun event to watch for all because of alice and hatter s antics the times guide does not publish the time so ask the piano player as early as possible what time this will be at find good seating for shows and parades disneyland hosts a few parades throughout the day depending on the season as well as night time showings of fantasmic and fireworks check the park schedule to see what will be happening when you re there most shows are crowded but you can manage to get good seats with some clever planning for parades head toward tomorrowland and right before you enter turn left and follow the path to the king triton statue this is a great spot to see the parade without all the people for fantasmic fantasmic seating is tricky but doable if you really want prime seating right by the waterfront directly in front of cafe orleans by where people board boats to tom sawyer island your safest bet is to set out a blanket a few hours before the show and rotate who gets to sit and hold the spot if there are two shows that night your best bet is to be hovering in the area just as the first show wraps up as soon as people start to get up and exit the area swoop in and grab a seat fireworks most people crowd to watch fireworks in main street so they can see them going off behind sleeping beauty s castle if this is what you want to do try staking out a a bench in the central square by the statue of mickey and walt or snag an outdoor table at the north end of the gibson girl ice cream parlor alternate fireworks if you don t mind missing the castle panorama the fireworks are also visible from the path that connects frontierland and fantasyland behind big thunder mountain or if you like roller coasters riding on big thunder offers a spectacular view of the show and the line for the ride is usually short enough that you can go multiple times throughout the fireworks if you don t want to see any of the shows then it s a great time to hit the rides while everyone else is preoccupied attractions like splash mountain and space mountain are usually easier to get on during fantasmic and fireworks enjoy smaller shows like the dapper dans or mickey and the magical map don t force people to go on rides no one wants to feel pressured on going something they don t want to maybe they ll want to go after they see how much fun you had on the ride in the meantime jump in the single rider line and get on the ride much faster know when areas close the park generally stays open later during the summer and on the weekends closing earlier during the colder months and on weekdays however certain areas will close down sooner if shows are happening here s a quick rundown if fantasmic is showing tom sawyer island will shut down around sunset if there will be fireworks toontown will close early fantasyland is one of the first areas of the park to shut down at the end of the night so don t assume you ll just go on the rides there once the crowds clear out specific closing times are posted on most rides exit wisely there will be a mass exodus out of the park right after fireworks or about an hour before closing if there are no fireworks the walk will be slow and the lines for the tram back to the parking structure will be long if you want to avoid the rush you can leave halfway through fireworks or stick around until the park closes get ready for a packed day if the crowds are thin and your energy is high it s possible to do both parks in the same day try to arrange your schedule so that you re not constantly criss crossing between the parks or you ll end it with some sore feet buy tickets early instead of waiting in line to buy tickets at the park buy them in advance online via disney s official tickets website if you order early enough you can have

knock out a few of the popular rides before the crowds get crazy people start to queue up at the park gates about an hour before opening both disneyland park and california adventure open at the same time so pick which one you d rather do first california adventure used to be the emptier of the two early in the day but that might not be the case anymore with the popularity of the new cars land area your best bet is to pick the park that has the rides you really want to go on first california adventure does close earlier than disneyland park if you want world of color seats it s probably a good idea to do california adventure first more information below take advantage of fastpasses throughout the disneyland parks the system can seem a little intimidating at first but it s easier than it looks and worth skipping the standby lines here s a quick discussion of how the system works you can get new fastpasses every 90 minutes fast passes are a completely free way to get the most of your time at disneyland dispatch someone to get your first round as soon as you walk into the park he or she will need to take everyone s park tickets along if you re not sure when 90 minutes is up the next time you can get fastpasses will be printed at the bottom of your most recent ones each ride that allows fastpasses will have a little fastpass station with 4 to 8 fastpass machines to dispense the necessary fastpass ticket you stick one ticket at a time into the machine and it will spit out a paper fastpass below that has a one hour window of time printed on it they have to be used on the day you got them once you have your fastpasses and the first time printed has passed you walk up to the fastpass line instead of the standby line which should be clearly marked for each ride the person at the front will check your passes to make sure they are valid then you hang onto them and give them to a second person at the end of the line fastpass times are now being enforced if your ticket says 1 45 to 2 45 you must show up between those times some popular rides will run out of fastpasses if you really want to fastpass a certain ride such as radiator springs soarin over california california screamin or midway mania or tower of terror do it early in the day some of the other rides that use fastpasses will have short lines at the end of the day anyway and you won t need fastpasses eat wisely and well food inside the park can be expensive especially if you re feeding a family though there are some unique dining experiences you can try here s a rundown of what might work for you eat meals earlier than usual or after the mad lunch rush of 11 a m to 2 p m and the equally mad dinner rush between 6 30 to 8 00 p m this way you can go on rides while everyone is eating and avoid lines when you re ready to eat be warned that for california adventure the fisherman s wharf and cars land eateries have the worst lines head over to hollywood land or pixar pier for shorter lines for disneyland new orleans square is the busiest hit critter country or frontierland instead if you re eating cheaply pack lunch and dinner and stash your meals inside a locker near the park entrance there are plenty of tables around the park for you to sit and eat if you do need to buy food in the park fruit is generally cheap and portions at the fast casual eateries are large enough to split between two people make advance reservations for any full service dining there are only a few sit down restaurants inside disneyland such as the blue bayou and cafe orleans but they fill up quickly there are several more in california adventure such as carthay circle and the wine country trattoria if it s really important to you to eat at these places make an advance reservation with disney dining at 714 781 3463 plan ahead with character dining character dining is offered at the plaza inn disneyland as well as a new pixar themed lounge and grill in california adventure this is an easy way to get some character time if you have kids but it tends to be expensive and fill up quickly your best bet is to make reservations in advance at 714 781 3463 decide when to buy souvenirs as with eating there are a few different ways to manage souvenir shopping depending on your needs here are a few possible game plans if you want to wear the famous mouse ears or any other headgear consider buying them at the beginning of the day so they ll be in all your photos if you re not sure what you want pass through a few souvenir shops during the heat of the day or when you need a break if something catches your eye return to buy it as you walk out of the park so that you don t need to carry it around all day if you have little ones and you re concerned about souvenir whining try this trick buy disney souvenirs less expensively online and pack them with you the night before you go to disneyland arrange your kids souvenirs as if mickey came and left them overnight like santa they already have new fun things to play with and you don t have to worry about shopping at the park problem solved know where to find characters if you have kids seeing costumed characters is probably high on your list of things to do though characters used to roam freely around the park they re now found at designated areas here s what you need to know if you want to get character

through mid march with the exception of president s day weekend mid april through mid may except during typical spring breaks mid september through mid november except for the week surrounding halloween although these times are less busy be aware that less busy and completely empty are not the same thing there will still be lines and lots of people even in the off season look online for discounted but reliable tickets disneyland itself may occasionally offer discounted ticket prices or bundled deals for a resort stay plus tickets this is the safest option for buying discounted tickets as third party sellers may not be reputable 2 x research source if you re in california you may be able to visit costco safeway or aaa locations to find small discounts on tickets residents of southern california can also get discounts on tickets during certain times of the year if you ve got proof of residence give disneyland a call to plan a trip within that time slot do not buy tickets from roadside stands craigslist or ebay these aren t authorized sellers and their tickets are usually scams you don t want to lose money you could be spending on a visit to see mickey plan to stay for

ll get more park time for your money 3 x research source although tickets are cheaper for longer visits the longer you stay at disneyland resort hotels the bigger your overall cost choose a hopper

parks this gives you the freedom to avoid longer lines at each spot 4 x research source you ll also spend less adding a hopper to your ticket than you would on an individual park ticket to either location book a hotel with a free shuttle service if you stay at the disneyland resort hotels shuttle services are free you can also find a variety of other hotels in the area with this option go for these if you can as parking on site at disneyland is expensive and time consuming 5 x research source while the disneyland resort hotels are fun and magically disney themed they will almost always be more expensive than other options in the area search through both types of hotels to make a list of the pros and cons 6 x research source buy a socal citypass to visit other parks in the area if you

california and seaworld 7 x research source be aware that legoland and seaworld are located near san diego about a two hour drive from disneyland fly with miles or on off days if you can if you re planning to fly into los angeles this could quickly eat away at your budget if you have a credit card with a miles plan check to see if your ticket can be purchased that way you can also try to fly during the week rather than on weekends to slightly decrease your overall cost you can also use online services that compare different airline prices as well as the costs of flying into nearby airports a little flexibility could go a long way start early in the morning and take an afternoon break wake up early and get to the park right when it opens it ll likely be slightly less crowded for the first hour take a quick and refreshing break in the afternoon if you need it then come back and stay until the park closes to take advantage of nighttime festivities 8 x research source if you drove and parked your best bet is to stick around for the whole day find an air conditioned ride or a shady spot to relax during the afternoon slump download the official disneyland app on your smartphone go to the app store on your iphone or visit google apps for android phones search for disneyland app this will give you access to park maps and real time updates on wait times for attractions 9 x research source be sure to download the app for disneyland and not walt disney world this app my disney experience will not be much help to you check the daily fastpass availability

max pass for a small daily fee 10 x research source you can use the maxpass to get unlimited photopass downloads for the day more importantly you can make fastpass reservations for that day from your phone using the disneyland app maxpass is a daily add on to your ticket or can be purchased as an annual add on for a higher fee this is a very different system than the one used at walt disney world so visitors more familiar with the florida based park should beware book your dining plans ahead of time generally it s a good idea to eat outside the parks to save money pick one or two must do dining experiences such as an amazing disney restaurant or a breakfast with your favorite characters go to disneyland s website to book these meals as early as six months out 11 x research source you can have breakfast with minnie and friends at the plaza inn in disneyland park 12 x research source stop by the blue bayou restaurant for a cajun style dinner in new orleans square at the park 13 x

them early in the day some rides with typically longer wait times include 14 x research source buzz lightyear s astro blasters star tours finding nemo submarine voyage indiana jones adventure space mountain matterhorn peter pan s flight big thunder mountain railroad try to use fastpasses for rides with longer wait times don t wait for more than 15 minutes for most attractions when you walk by the entrance to a ride it ll list its current wait time for most rides it s not worth it to wait more than about 15 minutes in line some will climb up to 45 minutes or even an hour and you should definitely skip those 15 x research source if you really want to stick it out in line for a beloved ride do so limit those longer waits to just one or two attractions however you don t want to spend your whole vacation in line enjoy the fireworks if you love light displays disneyland has several nighttime light shows and firework displays these can be pretty magical especially for first time viewers if you ve never seen them before plan to take at least one night to camp out among the crowds people will begin scoping out a spot to view fireworks a few hours before they begin you ll need to decide how much time you want to dedicate to firework viewing avoid the fireworks to hop on lots of rides because so many people choose to watch the fireworks this is also a perfect time to ride the rides without dealing with long lines plan to use most of the nights on your vacation to take advantage of this short but sweet period of low wait times 16 x research source pack your own meals when you can even if you re flying in from out of town it s a great idea to stop by the grocery store before you check into your hotel stock up on cereals and breakfast foods as well as supplies to make lunches packing these two meals can really cut down on costs 17 x research source even if you don t have access to a refrigerator you can buy non perishables like sandwich bread peanut or almond butter and honey fruit instant oatmeal and granola bars it s much harder to pack food for dinner unless you book a hotel with a kitchenette and kitchen supplies choose cafeteria style options when you eat in the park especially for dinners you ll likely need to plan for some meals in disneyland for day to day dining go for spots that aren t sit down restaurants fancier locations be more expensive and they ll usually have longer wait times 18 x research source try the french market restaurant in new orleans square or the galactic grill in tomorrowland for good lunch options 19 x research source when looking up casual dining options on disneyland s website check out the ones listed as quick service 20 x research source don t buy souvenirs at the park buy souvenirs ahead of time online or at popular retailers you can find disney stuff pretty much everywhere for relatively affordable prices in the park however shirts and cups will be super expensive 21 x research source if you or your child absolutely needs a disney souvenir pick it out ahead of time plan on that item being your one major splurge inside the park bring your own stroller or wheelchair disney charges pretty high fees for these items and they can t be taken outside the parks either bring your own or use local rental centers to keep costs reasonable 22 x research source having to check in and out a stroller or wheelchair each day will also eat up time that you could be spending on rides,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to enjoy a trip to disneyland,imagine getting mickey mouse s autograph while slurping an ice cream cone or sundae seeing spectacular fireworks and enjoying some of the most smile inducing rides anywhere this is disneyland the happiest place on earth disneyland is big it s loads of fun and it attracts large crowds every day of the year for suggestions on creating a memorable visit to what s now called disneyland park read on,plan ahead several days before you go to disneyland plan your trip especially if you want to stay for more than a day disneyland is a big place but in one day you should be able to enjoy most of the park s rides and shows nevertheless a disney visit lasting at least two days will allow you to take a more leisurely pace rest more when you feel like it and enjoy your favorite attractions more than once in any event one day or many a trip to disneyland will involve some planning ahead how are you going to get to the park are you driving flying and then renting a car going with a charter tour the options are many and you can consider them online with a vacation travel site you ll need lodging for a multi day visit book a hotel or motel room in advance just to be sure you ll have a place to stay this too can be handled online you can buy disneyland tickets at the gate but you may be able to find them cheaper online especially group and multi day packages airfare car rentals and lodging can often be bundled with tickets online even if you re going for just a day you ll want to pack up a few things the night before to bring along this might include light jackets because most of the year southern california can be a bit chilly early in the day and in the evenings consider bringing food too if you expect to bypass disneyland s many wonderful eating spots if you will have young children with you water bottles might be a good idea don t forget to check the disneyland website for information on seasonal hours promotional ticket sales and special events arrive at disneyland as you near the park you will drive past a number of hotels and places to eat treat yourself to breakfast before entering the park because many eateries in disneyland don t open until lunchtime get tickets if you don t already have them after you park a tram will take you to the main entrance across from disneyland is the california adventure theme park which is suggested for older children and adults since most rides there require a certain height you can buy a park hopper ticket and visit both parks in the same day more than once if you like know the popular rides grab a couple of park maps at the entrance these will prove invaluable as you navigate through the park if you forget to get a map at the entrance they re available in other locations the map will help you find your way to disneyland s most popular rides including the matterhorn space mountain splash mountain finding nemo submarine voyage and big thunder mountain railroad these attractions are spread out through the park and it may be a good idea to ride on them early in the day before the lines get really long that s where the map comes in handy allowing you to find those rides quickly and systematically rather than wasting time wandering haphazardly through the park most of the popular rides permit use of fastpasses these will help you avoid long waits in line but you need to be pretty organized to make full use of them whether you use fastpasses or not the earlier in the day you make it to the most popular rides the shorter and less frustrating the lines will be the one exception is after the evening fireworks more on that later find in park transportation if you don t want to do a lot of walking or if you have younger children with you there are many modes of transportation you can use to get around the park faster one of them is the disneyland railroad this steam powered train travels around the perimeter of the park stopping at stations in or near each of the park s main sections it also passes through the primeval world diorama a special hit with dinosaur loving youngsters there are other public conveyances particularly the buses trolleys and horse drawn wagons traversing main street get food disneyland offers a wide variety of places to eat try to have lunch before noon because after that hordes of hungry people will descend on every restaurant cafe and snack wagon as for the evening meal eat before six because the dinner hour can also be very crowded if you re just looking for a small snack there are food stands located throughout the park offering popcorn cotton candy french fries and lots more go shopping you ll find it hard to leave disneyland without buying a few souvenirs you ll notice many of the same items in different stores so if you missed something you liked in adventureland you can just buy it later on main street in fact it s a good idea to buy your souvenirs at the end of the day while leaving the park via main street so you don t have to lug them around all day main street has a lot of brand name stores with everything from hats and clothing to jewelry and toys if you re looking for an item related to a specific attraction try the shops nearest that attraction for example if you re looking for a captain jack sparrow pirate hat try looking in a shop near the pirates of the caribbean ride in new orleans square throughout the park you ll find shops that carry sundries such as camera batteries sunscreen and over the counter medications be safe while disneyland is a safe place for the whole family a few common sense precautions are in order when you first enter the park choose a meeting spot for your whole party to re assemble in the event of separation make sure any children in your group know how to find that meeting place since the park is big it s not hard to get a bit lost you can always ask a park employee including the disney characters for help in getting your bearings one especially tricky time is right after the fantastic fireworks show in the evening many folks will be heading for the exit and it may feel a little like a stampede this is a good time to secure your kids and stand aside or just go on a ride and let the crowds move out of the park before you do the same of course you ll want to keep an eye on your younger kids all day long don t let them go anywhere alone whether it s bathrooms shops or rides it s really not hard to get lost even if you re in a big party this is particularly true after the fireworks when so many people leave at once watch the fantasmic show this may be the best part of the whole day the hour long show takes place at the great rivers of america in new orleans square and is designed so that you can sit anywhere and still have a great view the show usually starts at 8 pm and ends at 9 many people grab seats at the last minute but that s not recommended you ll have to climb over people and squeeze into tight spots if you do grab a seat before 7 30 pm if you wait too long you may find yourself standing for the whole performance a good spot to see the show is right across from the pirates of the caribbean ride which will put you right in front of the action if you have children in strollers the strollers must be folded down by 8 pm so other guests can see the show remember to bring picnic blankets quilts and small pillows as it may get chilly at night and you may want to avoid sitting on the ground you can store these items during the day in public lockers on main street stay for the evening after the first fantastic fireworks show which ends at 9 pm most guests will be leaving the tidal wave of people mentioned earlier instead of joining them in the slow walk and drive away from the park stick around disneyland at night is really fun mainly because the lines are shorter this is your chance to go on the rides you missed or want to ride again keep in mind however that most restaurants and shops close by 9 pm so do your eating and shopping before then if you go to disneyland during the fall winter or early spring make sure to bring warm clothing if you re planning to spend the evening as the weather will be chilly if you still have shopping to do head for main street s brand name stores which will be open until the park closes also if you re not ready for the day to end and you have park hopper tickets head next door to california adventure for more fun there are also plenty of places to shop eat and be entertained in the nearby downtown disney district,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to find cheap disney world packages,a trip to a walt disney world resort in florida can be a magical vacation for the whole family but it can be a costly experience especially when the travel accommodations and meals are added in yet instead of putting off that family vacation of fun it s helpful to know that there are numerous ways to obtain discounts and budget minded packages that can reduce the cost of this trip considerably for tips on saving money on transport lodging park admission food and other entertainment try some of the suggestions starting in step one,decide what you want out of your vacation the walt disney world resort offers a huge variety of different things to do during your stay from roller coasters to sports to african safaris not everything will interest everyone so by being specific you can potentially cut down the costs and have a more focused visit most of all it will make it easier to take advantage of specific packages if you plan out what you want to do in advance take some time to think about what kind of activities you want to do during your trip based on the ages and preferences of everyone in your group the ticket options are explained below under purchasing discounted or good deal park tickets if you want to travel cheaply to disney world you may have to miss out on certain activities so prioritize the different activities into categories like must do maybe not interested etc you can learn all about the different parks and activities at http disneyworld disney go com parks and http disneyworld disney go com destinations understand that packages don t typically come cheap one of the nicest ways to travel especially to the disney parks is using a package vacation this means that airfare travel hotel food and park tickets are all included in one package for purchase while this makes things easier for convenience sake it doesn t look so good on your wallet unfortunately because so many items are being grouped together most packages are typically more expensive than each of the individual components are so what s the solution only book a package if you are certain the total is the same as the sum of all the parts consider nixing the complete package and buying smaller packages to combine together for example get an airfare hotel package combined with park tickets food package create your own package by buying everything individually and organizing each of the parts for ultimate ease of use plan in advance just like prices for airfare hotels and tickets individually the longer you wait the more expensive they become if you re searching for a package you ll need to start looking several months i e at least 6 months prior to when you plan to go on your trip this will allow you to spend necessary time hunting down the cheapest package and you ll be looking when the packages are typically at their cheapest there are two ends of the spectrum if you plan too far in advance close to a year or more or too soon before your trip a month or less you ll be unlikely to get a decent price on any package keep in mind that you can start planning early just to compare prices and see what s available you should wait to purchase anything until 4 6 months before your trip though search the right places although your first impulse might be to head to the disney world website you ll be falling into the typical tourist trap and end up paying a lot more money because of the ease of finding a package through the disney website they are able to increase prices on most all of the items sold including packages to the parks avoid going straight to disney s website and instead look for package deals on other locations look at the price that disney offers for certain packages so you have a price point to act as a comparison on other sites search as many other sites that offer disney packages as you re able in order to increase your chances of finding a good deal determine how cheap you re willing to be although it s unlikely you ll find a disney package that has 1 star hotels and cheap food you may need to consider minimizing your costs in other fashions decide what you re willing to cut out of your budget or what you can restrict your spending on food for example can be brought into the park instead of purchased you can also choose to walk or take public transportation rather than an expensive hotel park shuttle break down everything you intend to spend money on and then decide what you can cut from the list souvenirs may seem like a necessary keepsake but are highly overpriced and will rack up fast decide to only get mouse ears or something of the sort so that you don t end up wasting money on things you won t use in a few weeks only purchase food that you need rather than buying whatever sweet treat looks good this will save you money and your body won t be dragging as much at the end of the day if you re willing to simplify your hotel situation consider getting a single or double room and having everyone share beds or you can go extreme and have a single bed and everyone else in sleeping bags on the floor 1 x research source look for special offers throughout the year the disney parks have special offers on ticket hotel and food prices inside disney world generally different offers can save you money on lodging food activities and park tickets go to http disneyworld disney go com special offers to view a list of the special offers currently available special offers can be especially useful if you re a member of the u s military as many of the offers are tailored toward this group drive if you re able by far the cheapest way to get to disney world is to drive although this might not be a feasible option if you live on the west coast if you live in the south or on the east coast you should definitely try to make a road trip to the theme park driving will save you several hundred dollars on airfare especially if more than two people are traveling with you plus once you get to the parks you ll be able to use your own car as transportation rather than having to hire a shuttle to drive you around everywhere calculate the number of hours you ll have to drive and split that up into the number of days it would take to get to disney world because driving can conceivably take 2 3 days you ll want to try to stay at budget hotels or campsites along the way if you re bringing a large family prepare for the road trip by coming up with games and activities to do along the way book your airfare and hotel together if you re not able or willing to drive to disneyland you ll have to fly there instead it is unlikely you ll be able to find a cheap disney world package that includes hotel rooms for a decent rate but you can get around this by booking a different hotel combined with your airfare many websites will significantly discount the combined cost of your flights and hotel rooms if you book them at the same time therefore do a bit of research on hotels in the area and see if you can combine them with your airfare at purchase some search engines will allow you to name a price for a hotel flight and present you with what s available keep in mind that whenever possible go for the cheapest hotel and airfare on the market know when you book your airfare there are many tricks to the trade when it comes to booking flights and among the most beneficial is simply knowing the right time to book flying to a destination is always the least expensive from monday through thursday and especially on tuesdays and wednesdays air carriers typically have deals on flights on tuesday afternoons so plan on purchasing your flight on a tuesday after 2 00pm additionally you ll get the best price on your plane flight if

vista 2 x research source understand the different options for disney park tickets the disney world resort includes four different parks as well as two water parks with all of these different choices

ticket type allows you entry into one of the four theme parks per day water parks not included with this ticket you can leave the park and return on the same day but you must go back to the same park the park hopper this option adds a premium to the cost of your ticket but allows you to go back and forth between the different theme parks each day the water park fun more this option gives you

bit of research to see if you qualify bring your own food although you can t bring in coolers your best bet on saving money throughout the day is to eat your own food pack sandwiches and snacks that you can munch on during your time in the park so that even if you don t solely eat the food you bring you won t be so reliant on purchasing food it is also good to bring plenty of your own water and liquids as keeping hydrated will keep you less hungry and purchasing liquids inside the park can be quite expensive avoid buying food throughout the day if you re able especially sugary snacks that will just leave you feeling more hungry afterwards set a budget for snacks so that you are forced to avoid spending add dining to your package on disney s website adding a dining plan to your vacation

purchase only spend money on necessities yes four sets of mickey mouse ears might sound like fun now but if you re really trying to budget you ll need to cut out spending on everything except for what you absolutely need of course it s totally reasonable to have a budget set aside for certain fun things inside the park but just know how much you re willing to spend before you start spending it s easy to feel like something is worth buying in the moment but later on it s likely that you ll regret your spur of the moment purchase look for free pins and items around the park that you can keep as souvenirs a park map that you mark off along the way may work nicely make sure to discuss your budget with your family as best you can prior to entering the park so as to avoid any possible meltdowns

how to make the most of your day at disneyland resort paris,even at more than 25 years old disneyland resort paris remains one of the top attractions in western europe but without careful planning what should be a dream day out can quickly become a nightmare these detailed hints and tips can help you make the most out of your day,know how you re going to get in to the park depending on how you are visiting your ticket could be your hotel key a stand alone ticket or even just a bar code you have printed out getting through the ticket queue can actually be one of the most difficult and confusing parts of the whole process and can take over an hour at peak times of the day so if at all possible try and make sure you have tickets ready before you arrive at the park if you have purchased a disneyland paris package at a disney hotel your room key is also your park ticket simply proceed to the turnstiles scan the qr code on your hotel key and you can enter the park additionally may package holidays booked off site or coach tours will also provide you with a park ticket as part of your booking but make sure you check the restrictions on the tickets provided by your hotel or travel agent before entering the park some cheaper tickets provided by package holiday operators or coach tours are not hopper tickets so you will only be allowed into one park on the day if you hope to visit both the disneyland park and studios park on the same day ensure that the ticket you have is a two park hopper ticket although packages are convenient significant savings can be had by staying off site and purchasing your tickets separately especially if your trip to disneyland is only a small part of your trip to paris however if you re doing this make sure to research your tickets in advance in general guests visiting the park for less than five days should book online in advance if you are going to be spending five or more days in the park over a 12 month period consider buying an annual passport but always check prices current offers and annual pass blackout dates in advance before you go smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb 4 42 2306970 1 jpg v4

rel nofollow class external text href https creativecommons org licenses by nc sa 3 0 creative commons a br n p p br n p div you can book online and print your own tickets this is almost always cheaper than buying them at the park often including an extra day in the park for the same price as at the gate what s more it allows you to bypass your first queue of the day the ticket counter which can often take more than one hour to clear at peak times you do not need to exchange your print at home ticket for a ticket in the park just proceed to the turnstiles with your printed ticket and scan the qr code to enter the park make sure your printout is clear and consider laminating it to ensure it survives for the length of your trip booking online from inside france using the french disneyland page and your hotel address can also be significantly cheaper but may be subject to additional restrictions and may require delivery of tickets rather than printing them numerous third party online ticket sellers exist and can provide significant savings compared even to the official disney online ticket prices careful research of available online offers from different resellers can yield huge savings booking from french resellers and travel agents is sometimes cheaper than doing so in your home country especially if the exchange rate is in your favour but be careful to ensure that they are legitimate and reputable and do not have any problematic terms and conditions before booking annual passes are very affordable at disneyland paris and are almost always worth their cost if you are staying off site and visiting for more than five days throughout the following 12 months they can be purchased online in advance with pre activated passes provided or in the parks disney also offer a monthly direct debit option on their annual passes to help spread the cost of your visit the discovery pass is perfect if you are visiting disneyland as part of a larger trip to paris it costs 179 and allows free access to both parks for 150 select days throughout the year purchase this on day one and then visit the rest of paris for the next two days you cannot enter the park until two days after purchasing it then return to disneyland at the end of your visit this is a pass designed for locals so the availability may be limited during high season but it is available to all and is very affordable if the dates match your visit if you need access to the park on the same day or are visiting on a blackout day for the discovery pass the 259 magic flex is a good deal it includes only 65 blackout dates which primarily fall on busy weekends or during special event seasons eg halloween and christmas and it costs around the same as a three day park ticket it offers free on site parking 10 discount on merchandise purchased in disneyland shops 20 discount on one day park tickets for friends or family the 299magic plus pass is the ideal for those visiting on a longer stay and those intending to make multiple visits to the park or visitors paying for a lot of meals in the parks it includes just 15 blackout days during the main week of halloween and the week leading up to christmas day in addition to the above benefits guests with this pass get access to extra magic hours 10 discount on food in restaurants within the park access to the exclusive annual pass holders entrance in both parks a select number of one day park tickets for guests at a reduced price of 45 and invitations to exclusive annual pass holders events the infinity pass is disneyland paris ultimate annual pass designed for regular visitors and those who want the very best possible disney experience it costs 449 so it is not cheap but includes a lot for your money it includes no blackout dates and also includes disney s photopass which costs 69 99 itself in addition infinity pass holders receive additional discount on food 15 and in store 20 exclusive viewing areas for selected shows and parades free hire of strollers push chairs and wheelchairs free use of disney s kennel service for pets free use of the baggage storage service special reserved parking much closer to the park than the general guest parking area and use of pools in select disneyland hotels whether you are a guest or not in addition infinity pass holders have access to a special concierge service via telephone which can help with planning and making the most of your day if you plan on taking advantage of things like photopass guest storage and other rental services a single infinity pass can easily pay for itself over the course of a week even if other guests opt for lower tier passes the top three passports also offer savings on disneyland hotels up to 35 at certain times and are therefore usually worth exploring even if you are planning on staying at a disney hotel if you re visiting during low season the savings can be significant many non disney branded and non partner hotels in the marne la vallee area and especially big brand hotels in val d europe often offer either park tickets included in package deals or else offer special offers on disneyland park tickets always ask at your hotel reception desk what deals they have before leaving for the park give yourself as much time as possible you can get a feel for both parks the disneyland park and the disney studios park in a single day but ideally you will want to give yourself at least one day in the studios park and two to three days in the disneyland park and even more time if you plan on trying all of the most popular attractions that the park has to offer if your ticket includes extra magic hours magic plus and infinity passports and disney hotel packages make the most of these you can enter the park up to two hours before the park opens to the public and queues are greatly reduced not everything is open during that time and sometimes entire lands may be closed but generally several major attractions and multiple meet and greets will be open during this time as well as things like the disneyland street cars which typically close as soon as the park begins to become busy avoid queues where possible like it or not queuing is a significant part of any trip to disneyland there are however many ways to limit the amount of time wasted in queues visit high profile rides and meet and greets during extra magic hours parades shows and mealtime hours if you are staying for more than one day and have already seen the parades and popular shows queue times can often be cut significantly by joining them in the 30 minutes before and during the main parades each day however be aware queues for attractions particularly those nearby the parade route or shows balloon immediately after their conclusion eating early or late and queuing during mealtime can also save some time additionally as the park approaches closing time many guests begin to camp out their spot for the disney illuminations night time show the queues for many rides can be much shorter during the 2 hours before closing but beware a longer than expected queue or unexpected breakdown could result in you missing this spectacle fastpass tickets are included in your ticket price and you can claim a fastpass ticket by scanning your ticket barcode at the fastpass booths near the rides in order to ride popular and busy rides you should use fastpass tickets where available scanning your park ticket will give you a 30 minute return slot later in the day at which point you can enter through the fastpass lane which greatly reduces the queueing time additionally if you are an avid ride fan and visiting for a short time you may want consider the paid for super fastpass depending on the rides included the season and the amount of times each ride can be ridden it can range from 30 to 150 per day but on a one day trip can be the only way to do all of the rides and may pay for itself in time saved if you or a member of your party have any kind of disability speak to guest services about how they can help you in many cases you may be given a pass to bypass the queues and enter through the disabled access gate on most rides shows and meet and greets disney offer 2 types of disability pass the orange easy access pass for people with temporary illnesses like broken bones or other injuries and pregnant women and the green priority pass for people with long term or permanent disabilities including physical mental and cognitive difficulties disney have recently significantly tightened the eligibility requirements for green priority passes so ensure that you bring all of the evidence you will require the evidence disney will accept is a valid and current blue badge or a letter from a government department confirming the person s receipt of some kind of disability benefit such as a dla or pip from within the last 12 months as well as photo id to confirm your identity although disney claims they still accept a signed and stamped gp or consultant letter confirming that you have a permanent or long term disability many have reported disney cast members being hesitant to accept them spending a lot of time requesting additional information or incorrectly issuing orange easy access passes which have slightly different restrictions and conditions and may not be suitable for your specific needs asking your doctor to keep your medical note plain and simple clearly and unambiguously stating that the person suffers a disability or requires a full time carer and briefly stating the type of disability using the broad categories disney use eg cognitive difficulties instead of a specific diagnosis aspergers syndrome or anxiety and depression and avoiding extensive discussion of the condition or symptoms can help a lot and avoid confusion additionally if you experience any kind of disappointment e g ride breakdown significantly longer queues than those indicated guest services can at their discretion issue one or more single use queue jump tickets which will also allow you to enter through the exit gates when operating queues for the disneyland railroad are significantly longer at the entry gates and often in discoveryland than at other stations if you just want to ride it for the grand tour of the park rather than to get to somewhere in particular then it is usually worth getting on at the frontierland or fantasyland stations both stations are set back from the main park area and a little and off the beaten track so relatively few people stumble into the queues at these stations without going there deliberately both stations even include limited seating areas compared making the queue even more bearable when visiting with small children always take advantage of the baby swap service on rides for which children are too small this will allow one of you to queue while the other waits with the child and can then enter through the exit or fastpass queue as soon as the first rider leaves this reduces queuing times significantly and as an added bonus means that a single fastpass ticket can be used by both parents if the cast member is in a good mood of course single rider lines can significantly reduce wait times if you don t mind too much who you sit with single rider queues are available on many of the busiest rides to ensure that ride vehicles are not sent with empty seats and often result in a more than 50 reduction in wait times you can of course queue together as a group but disney cast members will split parties in the single rider queue so expect that you will not ride with your party in the past shows were relatively easy to get into and you could generally show up a few minutes before their scheduled start time and still get a seat however since taking full ownership of the park a few years ago disney have significantly improved the quality of their shows in paris receiving critical and guest acclaim and they are therefore often incredibly busy during high season the line for ongoing shows like mickey and the magician in studios can often fill half an hour or more before the advertised start time for the show and queues for short term seasonal shows like rhythms of the jungle part of the lion king and jungle festival can at times fill upwards of an hour before the show many who have watched them consider these award winning shows must see attractions but given that including queueing getting seated and the show itself they can easily take 2 or more hours out of your day and therefore especially on short visits it can be difficult to squeeze them in if you have a short visit but absolutely must see one of these shows as part of it reserved vip seating may be available which will allow you to beat the queues it is typically available in one of two ways firstly through disney s partnership with mastercard free reserved seating may be booked by showing your valid mastercard card including pre paid cards at city hall or guest services the tickets are only available on the day and are snapped up quickly so make this your first stop you will receive reserved seating for a particular showing during the day and can generally show up around 10 15 minutes before the show start time and get some of the best seats in the house alternatively for other shows reserved seating may be pre booked as part of a paid vip experience experience this may be booked in advance as part of your disney experience package or in some circumstances may be able to be booked on the day of your visit these experiences typically include an exclusive meat and greet character dining and reserved seating for a particular show and can cost in the region of 80 100 depending on the season in both cases if you can get reserved seating this will help you make the most of your time at disney but seats are extremely limited and may not be available for all days shows or performances and the time you loose queueing for them at city hall guest services may offset the benefit visiting the park off peak avoiding weekends and european school holidays where possible will significantly reduce wait times for top tier attractions and shows though be aware that off peak there may be more ride and attraction closures shows may be less frequent park opening hours may be reduced and special seasonal events are generally not scheduled french school holidays can be very busy over 50 of visitors on any given day are french however where those public holidays also coincide with blackout days for lower tier annual passports this is largely mitigated against as many visitors are local to île de france and hold these passports many will not be able to visit on blackout dates if you are visiting on a french public holiday make sure you check if it is also a blackout date if it is not you re in for a very busy day however certain other public and bank holidays and particularly those with a religious connotation are taken very seriously in france and are considered a time for family and friends most french businesses including public transport completely shut down or run at reduced capacity for this reason the park often does not get busy until after evening meals on these days but can get extremely busy during the evening particularly for night time shows and spectacles break up long queuing by regularly choosing walk on with very short queues such as it s a small world casey jr or le pays des contes de fées even though these may not be top tier attractions psychologically it will feel like you ve done much more with your time and future queues won t feel quite so bad make the most of meet and greets one of the biggest draws of disney parks is meeting the characters top tier stars like the disney princesses and mickey mouse can have very long queues but there are ways meet more stars in less time buy an autograph book early in your visit there is nothing more disappointing than seeing a character out and about and not having anything for them to sign you may not see them again so ensure you have it with you at all times the only guaranteed way to meet disney princesses especially the classic era ones is at the princess pavilion which typically has very long queues from opening to closing time or during character dining experiences however since taking full control of the parks disney have drastically increased the amount of walk around characters including princesses many modern era princesses moana merida rapunzel tiana etc can often be found around frontierland and adventureland and some renaissance era princesses can be found out and about jasmine can often be found at the aladdin meet and greet in adventureland alongside aladdin and when not in the pavilion other renaissance era princesses like belle and ariel can sometimes be seen in and around fantasyland primarily near the bridge between fantasyland and adventureland near peter pan s flight or in story book land at the back of fantasyland additionally on busy days princesses of all eras not scheduled to appear in the pavilion may be available to meet and greet at the old mill near the princess pavilion often with their prince s or in the case of belle in her provincial costume alongside gaston however none of these meetings are either advertised on the programme or guaranteed to be in operation on any given day so if you absolutely must meet a princess the pavilion or character dining may be your only option on very busy days like the annual photopass day the princess pavilion may operate via a fastpass like ticketing system this ensures that queues will be quite short during your visit usually less than 20 minutes to meet a princess and that you get plenty of face time with them while you are there however tickets are very limited on days where this system is in operation tickets are distributed from 10 30 am at the old mill but the queue usually begins to form at around 9 30 all tickets are usually gone by around 11 30 am and anyone joining the queue after around 10 45 is very unlikely to get a ticket like all fast pass tickets these tickets are valid for a 30 minute window increasing in 5 minute increments unlike other fast pass tickets they are distributed by hand by cast members and are stamped with the number of people wishing to visit this means that different cast members may have tickets for different time slots and if the time slot offered is not suitable it is always worth checking if another cast member has an earlier later slot available cast members will usually try to accommodate this but make no guarantees asking for a later slot is always easier than asking for an earlier one character dining at the auberge de cendrillon is a great chance to meet a lot of princesses at once and guarantees you a lot of face time and special attention it is a very expensive experience for guests not staying on a meal plan and bookings often need to be made well in advance of your visit to guarantee a table during high season but is a unique and very special experience in addition to princesses disney have significantly increased the number of other characters out and about in recent years it is not uncommon for there to be upwards of a dozen scheduled meet and greet locations throughout the park and as many again in non advertised encounters cast members do not typically know who will be out and at what time until that day so they cannot tell you if someone will be out again tomorrow but cast members at meet and greet stations do have the list of all meet and greet s for the day and if you are very polite may give you a tip about times and locations for that day additionally if you have access to a vip concierge service either as part of your hotel package or as an infinity pass holder your dedicated concierge desk may also be able to help finally on busy days disney guest experience desks may be set up throughout the park though primarily there to help with reservations they can often also get access to the times and locations of particular meet and greets make the most of extra magic hours not only are there usually several costumed characters out and about during this time the queues for these characters are also much shorter there are typically around 3 5 characters out primarily along main street during this time locations are usually next to the entrance to both arcades which run along main street sometimes near the bandstand as you enter main street at the end of the liberty arcade near casey s corner and outside the plaza gardens restaurant don t waste time chasing down a character who has just left a meet and greet location they simply can t stop for you there are very strict working time limits for costumed characters and if they stop for everyone they will never get out of the park but they will often pose for a brief photo on their way back to meet and greet location after a break if you walk with them it is often quicker to get autographs from characters that are out and about rather than at advertised locations as queues can be much shorter and more informal but there are of course never guarantees this way meet and greet s in the toon studio s in the studios park backlot are available only via the lineberty app the app is free and relatively straightforward but is controversial and not always reliable you can only make a booking via the app when you are geographically located there so make sure location services are turned on and it requires an internet connection the tickets typically go very quickly once they go live on the app so set a reminder for a few minutes before they are scheduled to go live find somewhere with a reliable wifi or cellular data connection and keep refreshing the app even for unscheduled character encounters disney generally operate a queue system for these meet and greets while it used to be somewhat of a free for all at these locations cast members will now usually seek to create a formal queue so keep this in mind and don t assume that just because the meet and greet wasn t advertised you can push to the front meals with characters are quite expensive but guarantee your family significant facetime with characters in a much more relaxed atmosphere often it is the only way to meet certain characters who do not appear elsewhere in the park disney hotels no longer offer meet and greet s in the public areas of the hotels however depending on your package there may be scheduled meetings such as character breakfasts included so make sure you check with the reception desk if there are opportunities to meet characters in your hotel this is typically much easier and less hectic than doing so in the park additionally disney also offer paid vip experiences through their disney special activities team which can include in room meet and greets or exclusive character experiences these are very expensive and extremely limited in quantity but for guests where money is no object these experiences are hard to beat there are often fewer characters out and about on hotter days and they are far less likely to go out of their way to meet you at anywhere other than their appointed spots so take advantage of the advertised times and places on warm days and of course if possible visit disney parks with small children ideally in costume in a crush to meet characters before a formal line can be created characters and cast members are all more likely to allow a polite small child to the head of the queue then pushy adults while children under 10 are encouraged to wear costumes older children teenagers and adults will not be allowed entry into the park in costume disney have a global policy in place when it comes to attire and dressing up in costumes which could be confused with a cast member is a big no no graphic t shirts mickey ears and other branded disney goods are fine of course but anything which either mimics a disney character overtly or could be confused with one inadvertently eg certain wedding dresses will not usually be allowed past security for 10 14 year old s who still look pretty young you will probably get away with arriving in costume especially if the child has younger siblings but if you re going to try make sure you bring a change of clothes just in case for disabled guests with a green or orange pass disney typically operate a booking system with only a limited number of disabled guest slots throughout the meeting to ensure that guests in the regular queue are still able to meet characters in a reasonable time frame there will typically be around 4 6 scheduled disabled slots per hour that the characters are out and they are scheduled to the minute you will typically need to queue with your green or orange card at the disabled entrance 10 15 minutes before the scheduled start of the meet and greet for popular characters and will be given a time to return these are only handed out in order and cast members can not and will not give you an alternate time if you are late for your scheduled meeting it is very possible they will not be able to honour your appointment so make every effort to be there a few minutes before the scheduled return time for the princess pavilion a similar system is in operation but with more flexibility to choose your own time slot cast members begin giving out bookings at around rope drop each day so make this your first visit as bookings go quickly during extra magic hours it is possible to queue at the disabled entrance and meet a princess there and then though it can often take upwards of 30 minutes to clear this queue on busy days for meet mickey mouse guests can typically show up at the disabled entrance at any time during its regular opening hours and will be taken directly to the meet and greet for meet and greet encounters not appearing on the schedule cast members typically operate with some discretion for disabled guests for some they will operate the same booking system as for scheduled meetings or an informal version of it asking you to come back to me in 15 minutes others will allow a small number of disabled guests usually 3 or 4 families at at time maximum to wait by them and send them in after every 4 or 5 families in the main queue and for still others particularly where there is not a clear and defined queueing system they may not be able to accommodate disabled guests at all and they will be asked to wait in the regular queues though of course will always let one family member queue while others such as those with concentration or mobility issues wait to the side for them to reach the front of the queue the particular system in operation will depend on how busy the meet and greet is how well cast members can manage the queues and how many other disabled guests they have already accommodated so please do not be offended if they cannot help you eating and drinking in and out of the parks disneyland perhaps unfairly has a reputation for being a very expensive place to eat and drink however this isn t entirely accurate disney restaurants in and out of the park are actually relatively affordably priced compared to outside restaurants however in a country renowned for it s culinary excellence it is perhaps understandable that they are considered expensive for the type and quality of food often served nonetheless if budget is your primary concern when you factor in the cost of leaving the park and travelling far enough away from the resort that prices drop you will be hard pushed to find meals for much cheaper elsewhere nearby disney dining is broadly broken down into four tiers take away and snack food 5 12 bar and counter service restaurants 10 18 mid priced table service 15 35 and top tier dining buffet 35 75 the difference in price between takeaway and the cheaper counter service restaurants is minimal but the difference in food quality can be significant furthermore stepping up from counter service fast food to some of the more affordable table service restaurants like the lucky nugget saloon can be worthwhile although the meals they serve is largely made from identical ingredients to that served at cheaper restaurants like the nearby cowboy cookout restaurant to the quality of the service is significantly better and can include refillable cold drinks look for open drinks on the menu which can more than offsets the difference in price if you make the most of it if you are considering using a fast food takeaway restaurant in the park the food at mcdonalds can be a little cheaper and the food at five guys both located in the disney village is significantly better quality if you have the time to leave the park approx 10 20 minute walk this can be a better option however the mcdonalds is very busy ordering food is a difficult and stressful process and finding seating can be nearly impossible and five guys while good quality for burgers is very expensive even by their own typically high prices because of the type of dishes they serve and their small menu s food is served quite quickly orders are generally accurate at their counter service restaurants however the queues to order can be very long particularly during mealtime hours and when people get to the front of the queue without knowing what they intend to order these restaurants will typically only serve 4 set menus including main side drink and desert a children s menu a handful of additional a la carte options which are typically made up the same items but not as part of a meal no drinks no desert plus perhaps a healthy salad or vegetarian option items on the menus cannot typically be swapped for anything else all of these will be on the boards above the tills and they do not serve anything that isn t listed to help keep queues moving know what you are ordering before you get to the tills order by menu number not name try to keep customisations to a minimum where possible no ice or no ketchup is probably fine but beyond this cashiers will probably struggle unless you speak french well compared to the us parks disneyland paris provisions for allergy sufferers can leave a lot to be desired in the park while most restaurants will have an allergen list for each meal they serve they cannot guarantee that there has not been any cross contamination in the kitchen and generally speaking cannot tailor meals to meet your needs other than leaving off the entire part of the meal that would cause an allergic reaction in most restaurants regardless of price point they also serve a limited selection of pre prepared allergy safe meals which are prepared offsite and reheated there this ensures that the chance of cross contamination is zero but especially during a longer visit there is very little variety which will also mean you ll be eating a lot of the same meals time and again if you have a particular intolerance or allergy your hotel s kitchen will likely be able to prepare something allergy safe to be delivered as room service but this can be pricey additionally some table service restaurants may be able to serve additional meals that do not contain a particular ingredient if you request them at the time of booking but this is not guaranteed to be available or possible allergy sufferers may do well to either schedule time to go off site to eat val d europe has a number of restaurants which can accommodate you or bring your own food rather than eating on site which can be expensive and boring bottled drinks in the park are expensive multipack drinks are available for much cheaper at the nearby auchan supermarket at val d europe via rer or even at the vending machines or small store in the marne la valee train station near the park entrance however beware that to get there you leave the park property and will need to clear security again contrary to popular belief you are very welcome to take outside food or drink into the park and eat there and outside food and drink other than alcohol and drinks in glass bottles are not going to be confiscated at the security check picnicking a particular french pastime which usually involves whole families bringing large hampers of food to eat in open areas over several hours is only allowed in the grounds outside the park this has lead some to believe that outside food is strictly forbidden as to most picnicking is synonymous with eating your own food outside this is not the case though sandwiches snacks and drinks can be brought into the park and eaten and the restrictions would only apply to anyone taking up a lot of space in the park for an extended period of time drinking water is readily available from water fountains throughout the park like most of western europe the water is clean fresh and perfectly safe to drink small bottles can also be filled at these fountains though by design larger bottles can not easily be filled keep a small 300 500ml bottle handy at all times however beware that some of the fountains may be switched off on cooler days and finding a place to refill can be tough so ensure you also bring plenty of drinking water with you throughout the winter season nonetheless regardless of season most restaurants will have a tap to fill water bottles inside them and cast members in dining establishments will always give you a cup of tap water on request unlike the us parks most restaurants at disneyland paris will serve wine or beer with your meal though this cannot be purchased alone and is subject to a surcharge if you substitute soda for an alcoholic drink with a meal at counter service restaurants but it is entirely normal to do so at the parisian park and drinking with a meal is considered part of the french experience and is not frowned on by locals enjoy the spectacle ever since the walt disney company has taken full ownership of the park in 2017 they have gone to great lengths to make the already impressive experience at disneyland paris even more magical and spectacular with plans to double the size of the parks in the next decade already well under way daily parades are hugely popular but very enjoyable their main parade disney starts on parade features a large number of characters dancers floats and even a mechanical dragon and is a must see experience the parade generally happens only once throughout the day so ensure you take note of their time great views are available anywhere along the parade route and additionally from the overflow queue line at it s a small world you should steak out your spot at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the parade for unobstructed views but any more than this is usually unnecessary in addition disney host seasonal parades during special seasons such as christmas or halloween these may run multiple times per day and generally supplement rather than replace the regularly scheduled parade in addition combination parade show s like the recent jungle book jive may be scheduled make sure you check your program for daily times and locations furthermore tuesday is guest star day and immediately before the main parade a mini parade featuring an unusual or uncommon character who is not part of the main parade takes place it runs in reverse from the main parade starting at the top of main street and running down to the passageway between fantasyland and discoveryland so guests wanting to view both this parade and the main parade are in for a very long wait between the two in the main park he newly refurbished frontierland theatre formerly the chaparral theatre the disney castle stage to the right of the castle as viewed from main street and the stages around the hub at the end of main street directly in front of the castle also regularly host shows and performances throughout the year depending on the season and recent performances such as rhythms of the pridelands and the jungle book jive have been very highly rated by fans and critics alike while open air performances like those taking place on the castle stage or on the stages at the hub do not have any seating and can be viewed simply by finding a spot nearby shows at the frontierland theatre are seated and strictly limited by the relatively low capacity of the venue for popular shows as mentioned above getting into these shows can be difficult and require a lot of queueing in the studios park there is not typically a daily parade hosted except during special seasons but there are a number of regularly scheduled shows which take place each day in the recently refurbished animagique theatre the iaapa award wining show mickey and the magician runs throughout most of the high season however unlike animagique which it replaced it does run in seasons and the cast do take breaks throughout the year so make sure you check when the current run ends before booking your holiday if this show is a must see for you in addition during special seasons such as christmas and halloween the show may be replaced with other seasonal shows in the disney studios theatre and the courtyard immediately outside it seasonal shows run at various times of the year these have included things like marvel super heroes united and the stark expo and guardians of the galaxy dance off during the season of super heroes or christmas themed spectacles during the rest of the year the theatre is used for both live action and video based shows incorporating both a full live performance stage and big screen projection ability additionally the motors action stunt show while scheduled to end shortly to make space for the work taking place for frozen land and star wars galaxies edge continues to run daily albeit in a somewhat slimmed down fashion compared to its previous incarnations disney illuminations is a multimedia nighttime spectacular featuring fireworks water effects music and video like disney dreams before it it uses sleeping beauty s castle as it s projection screen so is best viewed as straight on as possible though makes somewhat less use of the castle specific projection effects compared to its predecessor a perfect spot for this will need to be claimed at least one hour in advance of the show during high season though anywhere on main street will provide a good view as long as you can get square to the castle enjoy the rest of your day though rides characters parades and shows are a the main reason for your visit there is still lots more to do visit the boutiques disney is full of shops and shamelessly promote their wares at every available opportunity this can be a real turn off to some but spend even a little time in their shops and you ll quickly realise how beautifully designed and well themed they all are even if you don t buy anything many of the shops or boutiques as disney refer to them are just really nice places to explore full of whimsy and charm meet some cast members everyone at disneyland paris is considered a cast member not merely a staff member everyone from the street cleaners to the top brass are considered actors playing their part in the creating the wonderful illusion that is disneyland feel free to approach any of them to engage with them most of them really love their jobs and relish the chance to meet with visitors for a while all cast members are at least bilingual with almost all of them speaking french and english though many also have a basic grasp of many other european languages try your hand at pin trading disney have a vibrant and active pin trading community and providing you follow the rules all cast members with pins on their lanyards are more than happy in fact required to play along pin trading is a lot of fun and a great way to meet cast members and other guests there are thousands of designs available so even if you can t find one you like in store soon enough you ll have something that you really love several designs each year are only initially available on cast member s lanyards so meeting them early as soon as they start their shifts is key to getting hold of these designs if you are new to trading multipack sets are a quick and affordable way to grow your collection while most serious traders won t be interested in trading for these remember that cast members with pins on their lanyards or trading cards have to you can quickly diversify your collection and maybe just maybe find something really rare and unique which the serious traders will go wild for just walking the clean litter free streets of disneyland is a pleasure remember unlike a city or town everything at disneyland has been placed there with a singular purpose everything that exists is the way it is because the disney imagineers decided it needed to be that way with this in mind a slow stroll around the park becomes an exciting experience hidden mickeys are placed throughout the park by the imagineers hidden mickey s are anything which takes the form of the mickey mouse logo strictly this is one large circle and two smaller ones above it though any triangle of circular or spherical objects is possibly also a hidden mickey numerous online and printed guides to finding hidden mickey s are available but nothing is quite so exciting as discovering one for yourself keep your eyes peeled spend some time in disney village disney village is a disneyland s free shopping and entertainment complex you do not need to be a ticket holder to enjoy this part of the park or the public parts of hotels this is a great way to extend your trip if you have part days travel days for example for which you cannot justify buying an entrance ticket to the park proper disney village is also home to buffalo bill s wild west show a paid dinner theatre attraction if you cannot afford to see the show itself it is usually worth trying to find out if they will be hosting free a mounted parade through the disney village characters can be met in disney village especially in restaurants meet and greet meals are available outside of the park in disney village,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to compare disney world theme parks,if you ve never been to walt disney world before you re probably wondering what it s like by comparing parks it s sometimes a great idea to get an idea of what each park is like this article will try to give you this comparison,look at the parks from an educational standpoint while both epcot is educating the viewer with real life situations and about a person s normal environment both disney s hollywood studios and animal kingdom both have standpoints much the same though one is focused on the movies and the other on animals the magic kingdom is focused on educational views but in a fantasy fair way look at the parks from a fun like perspective while magic kingdom tends to be more fun than any of the other parks for those willing to stand the crowds other parks can have just the same amount of fun if you know where good clean fun exists try to compare the crowds while early magic hours takes people away from certain parks when disney expects to see massive hordes of people it draws that out on other parks crowds will be focused more around the younger set at both magic kingdom and animal kingdom and the older crowds at disney s hollywood studios and epcot look for excitement in roller coasters in some parks more than others while each park except epcot has at least one the park with the most thrill in their roller coaster is space mountain in the magic kingdom though some people may beg to differ reports have been shown throughout websites and in many books including the unofficial guides books that space mountain trumps the others any day of the year and in some can sometimes be too much excitement look at the setup of each park while epcot is set up in two moon like circles around two famous circular shapes world showcase lagoon and the epcot spaceship earth ball each of the other three theme parks have only one real central locale and has several lands traveling around the hub location look towards the travel arrangements between the ticket and transportation center parking lot for the magic kingdom and the magic kingdom itself to be a comparison none of the others have this setup once you re through the gates the whole park is at your fingertips just by walking no alternate forms of transport are needed to get from the parking lot and entrance to the park itself look for kid like bright cheery colors at the entrance to magic kingdom whereas all the others tend to be less bright and more adult in theme look towards the history of the parks while the magic kingdom is by far the oldest first opened in 1971 1 x research source animal kingdom opened in 1998 2 x research source is by far the youngest of the 4 parks look for classic theme rides to exist at the magic kingdom between the haunted mansion and pirates of the caribbean and it s a small world and the enchanted tiki room there s no way to resist not going to this park on any disney world vacation think in terms of parades while at any given time and day parades could be yanked from the lineup the two theme parks that don t have parades include epcot and animal kingdom one was the result of the parade being retired as of earlier 2014 and the other being the result of retiring and non replacement in the early 2000s most other parks contain at least 1 parade showing if not 2 per day look towards the differences in the lot names of each theme park each theme park is different but each theme park s lots are based on what the visitor is intending to see don t think that by going to a park the parking info will be any cheaper than any other park no matter what park you use you still have to pay the same admission fee however if you exit one parking lot and try to reenter another on the same day keep your ticket and show it to the nice parking lot attendant and they ll gladly admit you to the parking lots with no additional charge show your parking lot ticket and you ll be scott free to get in to two different parks on the same day,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to make a disney style homemade kitchen sink dessert,food choices might abound within disney world but there s one humongous snack that some people crave if you ve ever heard about disney s beaches and cream soda shop you ll know there s one dessert that comes with its own special challenge finish a bowl of kitchen sink and earn yourself a wall award marker however if you still can t get enough of the kitchen sink or have been turned around after a parking lot attendant said that walt disney world was closed due to covid 19 there are ways to make this popular dish something this article will come to try to do note read all ingredients first because if you either don t like an item or don t have enough you ll be better prepared to make something you ll be able to make and enjoy serves 4 people disney s recommendation 1 x research source assembly time 15 20 minutes with inexperience expect 20 25 minute preparation time,prepare all baked items which might not be found at stores pre baked you ll need to make three items including the brownies cinnamon spice cupcakes and angel food cupcakes for most of these recipes can be found online and on the back of some product boxes as long as you grabbed a package of the mix that can make these items bring all necessary items to the preparation area make sure to not forget all the ice cream and toppings and that all packages are open enough so all you ll need to do is reach in and dig out the proper amounts before preparing the recipe certain items may need to be further prepared the bananas will need to be cut and an oreo cookie or two will need to be crushed to dust to top the item but some of these candies will need further preparation before you embark on making this dish follow the ingredients list above to ensure every candy has been reproduced the same way that disney makes them bring over a large serving dish ice cream sundae and banana split sundae dishes won t hold enough of the dessert to make it anywhere near as close nor will an average cereal dish however larger serving plates should hold this as disney s looks like a kitchen sink complete with unconnected faucet handles overtop of the ice cream 2 x research source you can eliminate the looks of the official dish design from disney if you want to prepare this on a normal homemade level scoop two scoops of each of the traditional ice creams including vanilla chocolate and strawberry ice cream and place them into the dish try not to get too much from another flavor into each circular ball that you ll form if you are using a neapolitan ice cream box container and you might find it easier to purchase and scoop from single ice cream boxes instead scoop one scoop of each of the specialty ice creams disney uses mint chocolate chip and coffee but if you have a preference for two specialty flavors that you have available go ahead and use those instead make the ice cream into balls as best as possible disney may know the tricks to make the best ice cream balls to perfection but you will need to come close to form them disney requests a total of 4 ounces between each neapolitan flavor one ball will be about 2 ounces and with the specialty flavors form bigger balls to complete the 4 ounce serving disney knows how best to make them to perfection using their right scoops but if you make them too compact you ll end up with a mess towards the end and either too little to not suffice at the end or too much leftover don t use a melon baller to create the scoops ice cream scoops can help you form the right size ball and make it come as close as the ways how disney makes them layer the ice cream in a pyramid form with all eight ice creams although disney doesn t make it known the form of how the ice cream should look when it arrives most will find that forming a two leveled pyramid will often be enough and still give it the functionality that disney uses the order in which you place each ice cream is up to you ice cream pyramids stacked three on top of each other will become heavy to the bottom layers and often the topmost layers will fall down and onto the other snack if not eaten quickly enough be aware of your melting ice cream as you prepare the remainder of the dish primarily the toppings prepare this in an air conditioned area or for the ultimate thrill inside a walk in freezer with someone standing outside the door with the key in their hands and you have some way to tell them that you ve completed the dessert disney gets adept at making these scrumptious desserts and you ll often find them working in air conditioning drizzle the liquid toppings onto the ice cream balls however prepare for the worst disaster as some come tumbling down into the dish itself these toppings include all the fudge butterscotch peanut butter and strawberry toppings and the chocolate syrup and marshmallow cream make sure each ice cream ball has some of the toppings sprinkled onto it at first be aware that it ll drip back into the dish but if it stays in the bowl you ll be good to complete the remainder of the dessert bowl not all balls have to have each of the toppings on them however some of the toppings have to be tried to be on the balls for this dish to be close to complete in disney sense place the bananas into the dish disney says to slice the bananas in ½ inch slices but if you d rather slice them banana split style you can place these strips down onto the dripped liquids add in the other solid toppings using the measuring devices you ll need include the pineapple cupcake partials brownies candy bar oreos and jellied orange slices disney can eyeball the right amounts of the ingredients but for the inexperienced you will need to measure out each ingredient before placing it into the dish dabble on the lighter smaller pieces include those from the sprinkles shavings and morsels ingredients section above make sure that the almonds chocolate shavings milk chocolate chip morsels peanut butter morsels and both chocolate and rainbow sprinkles make it into this dish if you don t like almonds you might be able to substitute peanuts however if you have a nut allergy disney takes every precaution and ensures you know what you re getting into and you may tell them to skip out on the peanuts in lieu of more of another candy to prevent an allergic reaction top off the ice cream in the dish with an entire can of whipped cream disney uses a spray can variety of whipped toppings reddiwhip style cover the entire dish with one complete can you may let the whipped cream drip into the dish of other goodies if you don t have reddiwhip cans of whipped cream you may be able to use an entire container of cool whip instead allowing for differences in the looks of the product cherry top this dessert off with the half cup of maraschino cherries place a cherry or two on the whipped cream at the top of the heap and let the remainder of the cherries settle into the remainder of the mixture sprinkle onto the whipped cream the remainder of the crushed oreo pieces from the blended 1 tablespoon mixture you measured out serve and eat place at least 1 to 2 sundae spoons in the bowl and eat like a humungous sundae bon appetite keep this dish as frozen as possible when you can no longer eat it keep this dish inside a local freezer don t settle for anything less,Arts-and-Entertainment

roller coasters you re going to visit when you get there and get the park map or you can check out the specific coasters online wooden roller coasters are the oldest and most classic coasters usually operated on chain lifts they ll go very fast but never go upside down or in complicated loops for the most part steel track roller coasters are much more complex featuring lots of twists and turns often upside down but some steel coasters are good because they will have more turns and not as many drops they will also be less rickety and smoother than wooden ones there are some small steel coasters which are great for first time as wooden coasters are very bumpy if you re scared of the big drops look for a roller coaster with a curved drop instead of a straight drop so you ll get a gradual ride and won t feel as if you re plunging you can also choose a launched ride which accelerates you at high speeds instead of dropping you off of a large hill though these are just as intense in some cases it may seem silly but most kid rides allow anyone to ride and can be a great start try not to find out specific things like how tall the coaster is how fast it goes and other specific scary numbers it is a good idea though to check out the twists and turns so you can brace your body and know what to expect from the ride and avoid rides that do stuff you re intimidated by find these things out after you ride so you can tell others and be proud of yourself talk to other people about their experiences millions of people ride roller coasters every year and have a blast doing it there s little to fear from the roller coaster and lots of fun to be had talking about it with enthusiasts is a great way to get interested and excited in roller coasters for yourself also talk to people who were scared but now love them as it will help you see what you should ride talk to family and friends as well as park employees at the gate who enjoy roller coasters ask them what rides at the park are the smoothest or the tamest and which ones to avoid another good idea is to ask people what their first roller coaster experience was you can get a good idea of what to avoid on your first ride read online about the good coasters at the park you re going to visit try to watch youtube videos on anything you think you may go on to see if they seem tame enough for you understand that roller coasters are supposed to be scary if you re feeling scared by the idea of a 12 story drop going 60 mph 97 km h that s perfectly normal that means the theme park is doing its job roller coasters are made to be scary to give riders fun thrills and chills but they aren t actually dangerous as long as you follow the safety precautions and listen to instructions a coaster is thoroughly tested before being cleared for public use and all the rides receive regular maintenance to keep them in top working order you needn t fear malfunction at professional parks some injuries are reported each year from riding a roller coaster but the vast majority of those injuries are the result of rider error and rule breaking if you listen to instructions and stay seated you ll be fine statistically speaking you ve run a greater risk of injury by driving to the theme park than riding the roller coaster 2 x research source the chance of fatal injury on a roller coaster is 1 in 1 5 billion go with friends riding roller coasters should be fun and it ll always be a lot easier with friends to cheer you on scream together and support each other through it some people find it more comfortable with a

with people who will push you to do things you don t want to do when you find your limit don t ride anything bigger unless you are ready to push your limits it doesn t matter what everyone thinks of you if you ve found your comfort zone and want to stay in it don t let anybody try to push you around or pressure you into riding rides you aren t comfortable with yet look at your watch the average roller coaster is usually shorter than a television commercial in some cases you ll wait in line for 2 000 more time than you ll be on the ride the drops although very big will be over in the time it takes you to take a breath try to remember that the whole thing for better or worse will be over extremely quickly the wait is the big source of fear and anticipation and the ride is the fun part read the regulations and restrictions before getting in line before you wait in line make sure you meet the height requirements listed at the start of the ride and that you re not physically unfit to ride typically people with heart disorders people who are pregnant and people with other physical disabilities are not permitted to ride roller coasters start small it s probably not a good idea to jump straight onto kingda ka or smiler older wooden coasters with small medium drops and no loops are usually a good bet for first timers and those who want to try out coasters without getting scared spend time looking around the park checking out a couple of roller coasters to find the less scary ones 3 x research source ride some other exciting rides first to get your adrenaline up and to get used to the sensations while roller coasters might seem like a big deal they re not usually much more scary than other types of rides if you can handle the scrambler you ve got a roller coaster on lockdown don t watch as you re walking around the park as you re waiting in line as you re getting ready to get on try to resist the urge to look up at the big drop or the scariest part of the ride focus on talking to your friends and distracting yourself from what s about to happen there s no sense in getting worked up looking at the big drops now when you re on the ground think about other things and keep your mind off it when you re waiting in line focus on looking at all the people getting off the ride at the end not on the scary drops and loops they all look probably like they had a blast and they all came out just fine so will you sit somewhere in the middle if it is your first time on a pretty scary one the best place to sit is in the middle so you can focus on the back of the seat in front of you and don t have to worry too much about what s coming but you can still see if you want to the middle offers the gentlest place in the ride alternatively you might want to sit in the front so you can see if it makes you feel better not knowing what s coming is scarier for some people don t sit in the back most seats which exert stronger g forces during the sharp turns and the drops the ride feels more intense when you re sitting near the back of the cars follow the instructions of the park employees and the ride guidelines as you approach your seat and sit down in the car listen closely to verbal instructions and follow directions from the employees different roller coasters use different types of safety harnesses so you ll have to listen closely to make sure you get into them correctly when you sit in your seat make sure it feels comfortable and that the safety harness comes down across your lap snugly if you can t reach it or if the harness is especially complicated wait for the park helper s instructions if you lock it in yourself they ll still come around and check to make sure everything is solid when you ve got your harness on sit back and relax stow any glasses or loose jewelry that you might have on in your pockets and take some deep breaths you ll be fine look straight ahead keep your head secure and back against the seat rest in your chair and try to focus on the track in front of you or the back of the seat front in front of you don t look down or focus on things to the side which can emphasize the speed at which you re traveling and increase any feelings of disorientation and nausea don t look down in other words this is especially helpful if you re going on a loop look straight ahead and focus on the track and you ll only feel a slight feeling of weightlessness that should actually be pretty pleasant and should pass in a moment or two resist the urge to close your eyes inexperienced riders often think that closing your eyes will help make it less scary and that you ll feel better but closing your eyes will lead to feelings of disorientation and can make you feel nauseated focus on something stationary and don t close your eyes breathe deeply don t hold your breath on roller coasters or you might become light headed and everything will be worse as you re nearing the big drop take deep breaths and try to focus on your breathing instead of other things this can help to center you and calm you down focusing on a little thing just breathe in and breathe out it ll be fun to help you focus count your breaths as you take them breathe in deeply for a count for four then tense your muscles for a count of three then blow your breath out for a count of four continue cycling in this way to calm your nerves flex your stomach and your arm muscles at some point in the ride you ll start to feel some butterflies probably sooner rather than later that s part of the fun of the roller coaster but it can be a little overwhelming for some people to ease it slightly you can tense up your stomach muscles and your arms by grasping the hand holds provided for you on the harness and the chair to try to keep calm on a roller coaster adrenaline will be released in large amounts triggering your fight or flight impulses your blood pressure will rise you ll sweat some and your breathing will quicken your vision should also sharpen and you ll be ready for action you can alleviate this slightly by tensing your muscles communicating to your body that it can chill out a little ignore the spooky decorations lots of rides will up the scare factor by including all sorts of scary paint and dark lights and little animatronic animals or goblins along the side of the ride to scare you if you re mostly scared of the physical sensations these can serve to totally throw you off and make the whole thing a lot worse so you re better off ignoring them as much as possible if things are shooting off or moving just stare straight ahead and don t worry about it keep breathing alternatively some rides with a story line can help to distract you if you get caught up in it just stay focused on the fun of the story and stop worrying about the ride being scary yell loudly you definitely won t be the only one and the train is usually noisy anyway with people cracking jokes and yelling back and forth instead of just being quiet with fear screaming can actually make the ride more fun also you can also mix your screaming with some woo hoos screaming can take away the scariness and make you want to laugh use your imagination to your advantage if you re still freaking out try to use your mind to go elsewhere imagine that you re flying somewhere on a ship or that you re being whisked away to batman s lair or that you re the one doing the driving anything to take your mind momentarily off the dips and the drops can help to distract you from what s happening and make the whole thing go faster get pumped up and be a beast pretend that you re an unleashed kraken or some kind of dragon on the high rides if you have the feeling of power you will feel less tension and your mind will think of something else some riders like to have a mantra or a little bit of a song that they use to chant during the ride keep the melody to reflection mulan 1998 or poker face lady gaga in mind and just focus on the words instead of how you re feeling or just recite something simple like i m gonna be fine i m gonna be fine always use your own judgment if a ride doesn t seem safe to you or if the employees seem unconcerned about safety or if you ve heard about previous incidents or safety concerns don t ride that roller coaster especially if it s going to fill you with anxiety most rides at large parks are expensive pieces of machinery that are well maintained and tested regularly a roller coaster s track is typically inspected each day before the ride is run for the first time and will be closed down if a problem is detected 4 x research source if a ride has been closed frequently over the past couple of weeks it might be best to avoid it the chances of an undetected problem are slight but it might make you feel better to skip the ride,Arts-and-Entertainment

tension while you are riding the roller coaster this could help to make the experience more enjoyable as you let loose and scream throughout the ride 8 x research source close your eyes if you are afraid of heights you may hate roller coasters because you have a fear of heights if this is the case you may want to close your eyes while you are on the ride for example looking down at the ground

while you wait alternatively depending on your temperament it might be better to jump in the deep end and ride an intense roller coaster to get it over with that way you ll know you ve been through the wildest of the wild and you don t need to be scared anymore make sure that you meet the height and weight requirements at the beginning of most roller coasters should be a measuring stick with a minimum height requirement for all riders this isn t to punish enthusiastic kids who want to ride the big rides but to ensure the safety of all the riders the seats and safety harnesses need to be big enough to fit everyone so kids and especially short people run the risk of slipping through the harness don t sneak past the height requirement and then wait in line typically before you jump in the car the park employees will measure you with a height stick and send off anyone who doesn t meet the mark it would be too bad to have waited around for two hours just to get rejected at the last second most roller coasters feature warnings that pregnant rides riders with heart conditions and other physical ailments should not ride certain roller coasters most of these warnings will be featured at the beginning of the line next to the height requirement don t ride if you have any concerns about your physical health pick a roller coaster with a manageable line one great way to pick a roller coaster is to pick one that doesn t have an insanely long line very popular roller coasters will often have waits for up to two or three hours depending on the ride and the park so it s important to manage your time if you want to ride some roller coasters it might be worth it to wait several hours for one big one or you might rather spend your time riding other rides bring something to do in line or some friends to talk with waiting that long can be awfully boring and might be a lot more fun with a book or some buddies to goof off with be respectful and polite to everyone else in line who s waiting with you some theme parks also have fast passes which allow you to show up to a ride at a designated time skip the line and hop right on the ride this allows you to more efficiently use your time at the park though these passes are more expensive than a regular ticket pick your seat on lots of roller coasters the line will split once you get toward the end of it to line up for different seats along the car once in the loading zone pick the row you wish to ride in and get in that line any of the cars are great choices for your first rides some people love the front for the view while others love the back for what is called the goat effect a phenomenon named after the thunder mountain roller coaster at disneyland toward the back of the cars the g forces exerted on the riders are stronger making the experience more intense making up for the lack of view if you don t have much of an opinion or preference head to the shortest line to get on the ride the quickest less waiting less nerves more fun ride on an empty stomach it should be common sense but all the excitement of the park and the availability of giant elephant ears and turkey legs can cause some riders to forget roller coasters can make some people puke the g forces on certain coasters are strong and the feeling of weightlessness can cause stomach butterflies and sometimes nausea in certain riders for most of us that feeling will subside and will actually be part of the fun but if you ve got a belly full of dippin dots it might end up all over the car behind you don t eat right before going on a coaster treat yourself to something after you ride to reward yourself for your bravery it s also a good idea to make sure you go to the bathroom before getting in line you don t want to wait around for 2 hours to ride the vortex and then find out you ve got to go right before getting on and strapping in that could get ugly step inside the roller coaster train and sit down on most roller coasters a metal harness should be raised above your seat which you can pull down and lock into place if you can t figure it out don t worry too much because a ride employee walk down the cars and check every rider by tugging on your harness before the ride takes off listen carefully to any instructions given over pa speakers or by the employees there s no way they ll let you leave without checking your safety buckle so relax and remain calm all seats and safety locks are different so if you have trouble figuring yours out just wait until the employee comes along and ask for assistance more elaborate safety harnesses will usually be locked in by the park employees if you suspect something might be wrong with your safety harness tell a park employee immediately make sure you feel comfortable roller coasters are bumpy and you ll likely be jostled around in your seat which is part of the fun if you don t feel comfortable in the seat though that can make the bumps pretty irritating it might be a rough ride if something about your seat is uncomfortable communicate with a ride employee or restate yourself before the harness is locked in 1 x research source stow any loose items of clothing before the ride takes off it s important to stow anything you might lose while going very fast in an open top roller coaster sandals hats glasses and necklaces in particular are often sacrificed to the roller coaster and it can be very difficult to retrieve these items if you lose them somewhere along the way always remove your glasses and keep them in your pocket it s a good idea to give this some thought before you get all the way into the seat and are about to blast off if you re wearing a baseball cap it s sometimes enough to turn it backwards if it fits snugly enough but sometimes it s a safer idea to remove it and hold it stuff it in a cargo pocket or leave it with someone on the ground relax as you re sitting and waiting for things to get moving the nerves will probably start to kick in if you ve never ridden before it s common to start suspecting that something is wrong getting paranoid about every noise you hear and every little jostle everything you re experiencing is perfectly normal try your best to remain calm and enjoy the fun of the adrenaline roller coasters are very safe and reliable structures hold on tight and don t let go unless you feel comfortable most roller coasters provide little hand grips that can help to relieve some of the stress and allow you to feel like you re in more control of the situation grab on and have fun don t wiggle around or struggle with the harness after the ride starts in a given year several people will be injured on roller coasters it s true but roughly 300 million people ride roller coasters safely each year without incident 2 x research source the overwhelming majority of injuries are the result of rider error and rule breaking messing with the harnesses or sneaking onto the ride against the rules if you follow the rules and sit calmly you ll be fine always ride with friends roller coasters are a great communal experience going alone on an empty car would be a dull ride one of the most fun things about the roller coaster is listening to everyone laugh scream shout funny comments and go through the whole ride together if you re with close friends on a beautiful day at the park riding a roller coasters can be extremely fun friends can also help keep the experience light and distracting if you re too busy goofing off with your friends you won t have to spend time being worried about what s to come while you re waiting in line just focus on having fun don t get goaded into riding roller coasters you re not ready for by ambitious friends if all your friends want to ride on the super scary looking seven looper and you re not into it go on other rides in the meantime and meet up later get over the first hill most roller coasters have one thing in common a long slow build up to the first massive hill and the first big drop classic roller coasters all have the opening drop and once you get that out of the way the rest of the ride is just fast and fun if you re feeling nervous just get that out of the way and you ll be in for a treat the long slow pull up to the first drop is one of the scariest parts of the ride because nothing is actually happening and it s painfully slow try to enjoy it for the anticipation it builds it ll all be over soon some riders who get really scared like to close their eyes but that actually make it a little more nauseating if you can t see what s coming up if you can try to keep your eyes open to stay aware of your surroundings it ll be more fun that way yell when you coast over that first big hill a lot of people will probably start shouting with glee join them there are few times in life you get the chance to really let loose with a howl of total delight like when you ride a roller coaster your adrenaline will be pumping and it s a great time to let out a primal scream it s also true that screaming in a group can trigger the release of oxytocin a hormone that soothes and calms the body in certain conditions 3 x research source this means that screaming can actually help calm you down and produce feelings of euphoria find out if some coasters run forward and backward if you ve gotten over your first coaster congratulations now the real fun begins more often than not most people who start to ride coasters want to get right back in line immediately the rush from a good roller coaster is like nothing else in the world and what s better riding the same roller coaster you just rode but backwards if you find one you really like you can experience it for the first time all over again going backwards many roller coasters will be run forward for most of the day and run backward at a certain hour find out at the park near the front of the line what the schedule for running is or just look at the track closely to see if they re running it backward some roller coasters always run forward and backward using two tracks that run simultaneously the racer at king s island is a classic example of a backward running roller coaster classic try a launched roller coasters launched coasters start off with a bang using hydraulic pneumatic pressure or lim or lms to immediately launch the cars from a standing position into a fast speed sometimes as high as 60 or 80 mph 97 or 129 km h giving you little time to brace yourself but it also helps to get it over with quickly these will often go upside down corkscrew and do other fun twists and turns kingda ka at six flags great adventure is possibly the most famous example of a launched coaster try a coaster that goes upside down next challenge doing a loop the first time you go upside down on a roller coaster is a big moment for a lot of people but it seems way more intimidating than it turns out to be and twice as fun you ll be weightless for a quick second and it ll be over with roller coasters that feature loops are often long and elaborate or fast and intense with lots of crazy maneuvers if you ve braved a traditional roller coaster start upping the ante what rattles most people during their initial rides isn t actually the drops or the nausea but being jostled around doing loops is one of the smoother parts of riding a roller coaster most times so it s not something that should scare you off of taking a ride on one try to ride every roller coaster in the park the olympics of the theme park riding every coaster in one day it s possible if you break up your time effectively and are willing to wait in long lines going about your mission with some planning will also likely help by the end you might be a full blown coaster addict to make it try to

although this is much less common than people think it s a good idea not to eat or drink a large amount before getting on the roller coaster your stomach may already be in knots and you can always have a celebratory ice cream after you finish the ride 1 x research source it s perfectly fine to eat a moderate amount before going on a roller coaster if you feel comfortable doing it not eating beforehand is a good way to soothe anxiety for those who are worried about getting sick on the ride understand the safety features many people who are afraid of roller coasters fear that they will get hurt during the ride or get dislodged and fall while on the roller coaster appease this fear by reading about or observing the safety features of the roller coaster that you want to try 2 x research source all roller coasters have bars or even cages that come down and locks before the ride starts these bars are made to keep you safe and only unlock after the ride is over the bars usually go across your chest and also between your legs so there is no way that you would be able to slip out of the roller coaster even if it goes upside down the carts of roller coasters are connected to the rails so it would be impossible for the cart to fall off they also have an anti roll back system that ensures that the carts keep moving forward as opposed to rolling backward know what to expect

boarding the ride if the person working at the ride tries to seat you separately tell them that you prefer to sit with your friend a familiar face by your side will give you the courage that you need 5 x research source sit in the middle of the train if you can aim for a seat near the middle of the train if you re already scared it s best not to sit in the front row where the ride can seem the scariest or the back where it tends to be bumpiest the middle is the best location for those who feel nervous because it offers the smoothest ride and places you in the midst of the other rows so that you feel more secure hold on to the restraints after you have sat down on the ride and are harnessed into your seat grab hold of the bars near your chest rattle them as hard as you can so that you can see that you re firmly strapped in and that even with all your weight pressed against them the restraints will hold 6 x research source holding onto the bars during the ride also helps you to feel more grounded and secure take a few deep breaths before the ride starts breathe deeply to relax your body and your mind before the ride starts when people are nervous they often hold their breath or breathe shallowly which only adds to a quickened heart rate and feelings of anxiety 7 x research source keep your eyes open even though it may seem counterintuitive it s actually better to keep your eyes open rather than shutting them during a roller coaster ride closing your eyes will prevent you from seeing what is coming on the ride and psychologically makes you feel like you have less control over what is happening 8 x research source when you are able to see that you are going to go down a big drop or go upside down your body instinctually braces itself if you don t do this the ride feels much rockier and wilder scream to release tension screaming on a roller coaster keeps your blood flowing and helps you to release your tension and anxiety a roller coaster is one of the only places where you can scream your head off without any judgment so go for it think of all the things that used to scare you that you now love because fear stems from negative thoughts try to think encouraging and positive thoughts before and during the roller coaster ride start by remembering all the things that you were afraid of doing the first time that you now love to do these could be things like flying going go carting or riding a bike for the first time think back on how scared or nervous you were to do these things for the first time this should help you put the roller coaster ride into perspective and you will be able to see that riding big roller coasters may be something that you discover you love to do remember that roller coasters are safe if you are afraid of getting hurt while riding the roller coaster take a step back and remember that the chances of getting hurt on a roller coaster are much less than that of driving in a car something that you likely do every day even

how to keep calm on a roller coaster,roller coasters can seem scary especially if they are fast this article will show you how to keep calm on a roller coaster and have the most fun,practice self calming techniques breathe slowly and deeply and try to think positively once you have done this it will all be worth it tell yourself things that confirm the fun and safety of using the rollercoaster for example it s not as bad as it looks they have safety harnesses and the tracks are tested all the time to ensure they re safe the restraints fail safe which means that the default position is locked it takes more effort to open them perhaps even look up the statistics of injury on a rollercoaster you will find that you are more likely to be struck by lightning of get hurt in a car accident people scream because it s exciting scary not bad scary it s only for a short time then i ll probably want to get back on and have another go because it s over so quickly even if the worst case scenario happens and you hate it it will only last for about 2 1 2 minutes then you have conquered it praise yourself for getting on tell yourself well i ve made it now it s going to be all right now that i m on here or i ve finally done it go with someone you trust this can help a lot to keep you calm and to have reassuring feedback from a person who is used to the rollercoaster or is able to deal with fears better be careful not to choose someone as afraid as you this can turn into a situation where you feed off each others fear and make things seem a whole lot worse double check your harness bar or other restraint listen for the click or other sound it makes when it shut several of the newer roller coasters don t have clicking restraints this means you can have the restraint closer to your lap so you don t moved as much these restraints are still perfectly safe and they won t unlock during the ride keep your eyes open it can be tempting to shut them but you can become disorientated making you feel nauseated aim to breathe deeply this can help you to keep calm and can reduce the possibility of vomiting count under your breath if it helps you to keep your breathing steady listen for the music there is often music accompanying the ride this may help to calm you if you concentrate on listening to the words or tune scream that s what the ride s all about anyway when you scream going down from high drops it helps to expel the air and helps you to breathe as well as releasing stress to help you have fun talk to your buddies talking is a good way to distract yourself during the ride however if it s hard to hear you might end up yelling rather than talking so be considerate of other people the best time to talk is on the lift hill this is the part where you have to wait to drop stay at the front this can help you to feel less scared it s not ideal to sit here if you re looking for more thrills though however if you aim to not see the biggest field of view the cart behind will allow for that praise yourself at the end you did it and you know you can do it again overcoming fear is a constant challenge in life and it s a great thing that you re practicing this lifelong skill,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to enjoy a roller coaster,amusement parks are a widely loved attraction and any great park has some serious coasters for the ultimate thrill roller coasters can be a great way to get an adrenaline rush but they can also be scary for a lot of people by picking the right seat learning about safety features trying out all the types of coasters and many other steps you can learn how to enjoy riding a roller coaster,start out small if this is your first time riding a coaster or if your first few times terrified you seek out the smaller coasters either look at the park website ahead of time to see what they offer look at the park map to find out the sizes and don t be afraid to ask someone who works at the park which roller coaster would be best for a beginner 1 x research source for young riders amusement parks often have kid oriented coasters that give you thrill but are designed especially with kids in mind even if riding the child coasters isn t an option most parks have a range of coaster sizes so you can find one that fits you watch the coaster and the riders you can get a good idea of what the ride will be like by looking at the coaster s structure watching a couple trains go through the circuit and watching and listening to the riders if the track has multiple big drops loops corkscrews or other features that scare you maybe pass on that particular coaster for now try to find one that seems like the right intensity for you if you are with friends ask if they have ridden specific coasters and can tell you about them you can also ask people coming off of the ride what the experience was like for them sit in the test seat at the entrance to many roller coasters is a model of the seat featured on the ride before going on the coaster for the first time try out the test seat to make sure you will be comfortable with the seat itself and the straps pull down bars and harnesses the seat has 2 x research source if you aren t comfortable in the test seat you will most likely not be comfortable once the ride is fully in motion sit in the middle of the train once you have decided to ride a specific roller coaster you have to pick what part of the train you want to sit in each portion of the train will experience the ride a little bit differently and even if the coaster itself is a good fit certain parts of the train may not be right for you for first time or inexperienced riders the middle is the best spot to sit in because it offers the mildest ride sitting in the front gives you a view of exactly where you are headed which may seem comforting in theory but can actually be scary for first time riders the back of the train experiences the highest speed going down hills and tends to have the roughest ride around curves 3 x research source appreciate being back on the ground once you have completed the ride your body will most likely need some time to adjust to the change of being back on solid stable ground to finish your ride well take a moment to appreciate the calm of walking slowly again 4 x research source you can also purposefully take some slow breaths to calm your heart down if it is still racing from the ride another way to calm down is to talk to a friend about what the experience was like seek new coasters if you have already ridden coasters for a while think about what coasters you have ridden before and seek out ones similar to that rather than riding the same coasters you have been on many times before new ones of similar intensity will increase your enjoyment if you started out with a few wooden coasters and low key steel coasters try moving up to a more intense steel coaster you can even use a coaster directory to explore 5 x research source one thing to pay attention to is what type of seat the coaster has are your feet dangling are you standing up in the harness you can tell a lot by the track and seats of the coaster if you can tell for sure it goes upside down goes super fast or you can see huge drops consider whether you are ready for these aspects most mid size to large parks have steel coasters that are more moderate and may be fast and high but don t go upside down change how you ride if you have only been riding for a while maybe you have spent most of that time holding onto the lap bar or harness take the step of letting go and raise those hands up for the whole ride as long as this is an option if you have ever kept your eyes closed before try keeping them open and seeing all the different views along the way you may have noticed people tend to scream on roller coasters this can be a fun way to release any lingering fear you may have during the ride sit in new locations inexperienced riders may take a seat wherever there is one open but when you want to try some new try choosing a seat you ve never sat in before even if you have ridden the coaster many times sitting in a new spot can change the ride sit in the very front and see things before everyone else sit in the very back for a faster and rougher ride some coasters may have forward and backward facing seats so pick a direction you haven t faced before find new styles one of the most exciting aspects of roller coasters is that there are almost endless ways they are designed specifically regarding the types of seats and how you are positioned during the ride trying types of coasters you ve never experienced is kind of like riding one for the first time if you have never ridden a standing coaster find a park that has one and go ride it never ridden one where you are hanging from the seat and facing the ground you ll feel just like you are flying how about riding one that launches you at top speed or one that faces backwards take one step at a time you might still be near the beginning of your roller coaster riding career so you don t have to become an all out adrenaline junkie in one trip try one new coaster that you were too scared of at first or one new seat location don t think that you have to tackle the whole park at once reassure yourself by learning about safety standards while it is true that people have been killed and injured on roller coasters these are most commonly due to people breaking riding rules set by the park the international association of amusement parks and attractions calculates the odds of experiencing a fatal injury on a ride at fixed site amusement parks such as disney six flags etc to be one in 750 million 6 x research source learn about what kind of safety standards parks have to follow far more people are affected by car accidents than by roller coasters but people are rarely afraid of riding in cars you could plan which coasters to ride before you go to the amusement park and you could specifically research those coasters to find out the safety features and what their track record is like park websites should include safety information read about how roller coasters work understanding the design of the structure and the physics at work can reassure you of their safety you can learn how potential and kinetic energy are at work during the ride or about how the train is attached to and slides along the track for example most roller coasters are attached to the track by rollers both on top of the track and on the bottom side of the track which makes the ride safer 7 x research source the main benefit of learning about coasters is that once you know some of the physical aspects it won t be as mysterious to you learn about the history of roller coasters besides the scientific aspects of roller coasters you could also reassure yourself by learning about their long history such as when the first one in american was built 1884 learn about how the earliest coasters were constructed versus new techniques used today one of the greatest safety advancements was the implementation of computers systems that control and monitor roller coasters from the start of the ride to the finish other improvements to safety features include padded headrests ratcheting safety restraints and magnetic braking systems all of which were designed with rider safety in mind 8 x research source visit the website of the international

how to identify a painting,learning more about a piece of famous art is easy but identifying an unknown or obscure painting can be kind of tricky there are so many paintings in existence that the odds of finding information about a specific image can feel insurmountable luckily you can dramatically narrow down your search by assessing the composition subject matter and style start by using an image recognition app and reverse image search museums and art historians are in a perpetual effort to upload and catalogue paintings and artists online so it may be easier than you think to find the information you re looking for,use an image recognition app to identify the painting immediately if you re struggling to remember an artist s name or you want additional information on a particular painting download an image recognition app designed specifically for art there are several apps for both android and iphone that allow you to snap a photo of a painting to search through museum catalogues university databases and art history texts this is the easiest way to find a specific painting 1 x research source the two most popular apps for recognizing artwork are smartify and magnus both of these apps will pull up information about the work s artist as well as interesting facts and background information about the composition these apps only have access to paintings that have been well documented and catalogued by curators professors historians and other artists if the painting is made by a more obscure artist these apps may not work run a reverse image search if you have a digital copy of the painting if you re looking at a painting on your computer or phone run a reverse image search copy and paste the image s url into the search engine run the search to pull up other websites displaying the painting this will give you access to a variety of websites that will tell you everything you need to know about the painting 2 x research source if you re using google chrome you can right click an image and select search google for this image to search the web you can download an image and upload it to the engine instead of copying and pasting the url if you prefer the most popular reverse image search is tineye but there are several options available online use the signature or monogram to dig online and find the image look in the corners of the painting to see if there is a signature or monogram if the name is easy to read simply search the artist s name up online to find the painting if it s harder to read look carefully to see if you can break down the letters and read them this will let you narrow down the search and figure out who the artist is which can make it easier to find your specific painting 3 x research source a monogram refers to a 2 to 3 letter design containing the artist s initials monograms tend to be more popular among painters working after the 1800s signatures were almost never used before the renaissance which began around 1300 even if you can t identify a signature at least you have a baseline for your search 4 x research source you have to sign up for a free account to use it but you can use https artistssignatures com to reverse search for an artist s signature this is useful if you think you can read the signature but want to double check to make sure you aren t misreading it ask an expert to identify the era style or painter of an image email or visit a museum curator art history professor or gallery owner to ask if they can take a look at the image an expert in the field of art will be able to offer insights about the period style and give you a better sense for where to look they may even know who the artist is as soon as they take a look at it 5 x research source if you re contacting a gallery owner try to find a gallery that specializes in the type of art you re trying to identify for example a contemporary abstract piece is going to be easier to identify if the gallery owner mainly focuses on newer artists use obvious clues in the subject matter to narrow down the date contemporary painters may paint people or objects from the past but they can t time travel if there s a train company logo digital clock or some other time specific component of the painting this is a great way to set a baseline for your search you can get a good overall sense for when a painting may have been made simply by asking yourself when an artist would have painted their subject for example there aren t many painters alive today painting portraits of spanish aristocrats from the 1600s and absolutely nobody was painting images of elvis presley before 1954 for example if there is a small airplane in the background of the painting you know that the painting must have been made after 1903 since that s when wilbur and orville wright first successfully flew a plane identify the artistic movement by assessing the style of the painting there are various artistic movements throughout history that share similar qualities determining the movement associated with an image is a great way to quickly narrow down your search since historians group artists from the same movement together 6 x research source there are hundreds of movements if you can t figure out the movement at first glance look through museum catalogues and online collections to find similar paintings determine if the artist used acrylic paint to see if it was made after 1940 get as close as you possibly can to the image if the color looks flat and the darker colors don t reflect light it s probably oil paint if the color is reflective shiny and looks kind of plastic it is likely acrylic paint acrylic paint wasn t used in art until 1940 so you have a much smaller period to search through 7 x research source if more than one medium was used to produce a work it is highly likely that the image was created after 1900 it was fairly rare before this period to combine multiple materials to produce a painting this is a lot harder to do if you re looking at a digital image but if the colors are almost supernaturally bright or neon the painting was probably made with acrylic assess the quality of the canvas or paper to determine the date if the canvas is stapled into the frame uniformly it is unlikely to have been made before 1900 which is when canvases were first mass produced you can also assume the painting is relatively newer if it s is on paper and there s no tearing damage or general wear and tear paper is relatively fragile and it s unlikely that a fresh piece of paper is particularly old 8 x research source if the canvas is hanging loosely on the frame the painting may have been made prior to 1600 before 1600 most artists weren t particularly good at stretching the fabric tight against the frame search through websites and catalogues after narrowing the search if you know you re looking for art from a specific time period or movement go online and search through galleries and websites related to this type of art look for paintings that are similar in style color and composition you can also go through museum databases and encyclopedias to find your image to do this as well with enough luck you ll find the artist 9 x research source almost every major museum has an online dataset that you can search search through these catalogues to find similar pieces that may belong to your artist once you have the artist finding the specific painting is fairly easy museums and universities often catalogue and document the entire body of work for well known painters so you should be able to find the specific painting just by poking around online inspect the back of the painting to find notes from previous owners if you really can t find anything about an image in your possession using traditional search methods flip the canvas over and look at the back if the image is a print or reproduction it may be listed on the back if the painting is a family heirloom or was bought at a thrift shop there may be a handwritten note describing where the painting is from 10 x research source use the other steps in this method first before looking for lesser known details it s possible that the painting is a reproduction print or mass produced version of a popular painting if you see 2 3 numbers listed in a corner the painting was probably purchased at a thrift shop or resale store the employees of these stores often write the price on a back of a work you re unlikely to be able to identify the artist or image in this case check the frame to see if you can find a manufacturer inspect the frame on the back and look for an imprint or label frame manufacturers often print a company name on the back if there is a name contact the manufacturer to learn more about the frame itself this can drastically narrow down the region and time period where a painting was produced 11 x research source if you only have the canvas and there is no frame check the wood portion of the canvas on the back prior to 1900 most artists stretched their own canvases if there is a signature on the wood frame it s probably the artist s this isn t really a helpful option if the painting is well known or really old since it was likely re framed at some point take a large collection from an unknown painter to an art dealer if you stumble on a large number of paintings and you can t find a single thing about the artist online or through close inspection contact an art dealer many lifelong artists paint simply because they enjoy it and it s possible that you may have stumbled on to a unique collection from a totally unknown artist 12 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment

about what you re drawing there aren t many solid techniques like there are in other styles of art there are however a few basic techniques first you would typically start with a solid outline this outline can be anything like a face or a car then divide the object into sections and fill in these sections with repetitive patterns 4 x research source for example you could fill in the sections with repeated circles dots and swirls essentially take an ink pen and begin to create the repetitive patterns create repetitive patterns on a piece of paper without focusing on the results you have to

research source try a basic pattern if you do want some guidelines try to draw basic patterns for example start with a square then fill the square with patterns for example you could fill it with a lot of small circles triangles and wavy lines 6 x research source turn your practice drawing the repetitive patterns into a sketch basically you should use the lines to create the shape and sections

sketch you need a sketch only if you prepare for a large the wall size artwork like a mirror you need no preparation or sketches if you draw the small or medium size artwork nadia russ recommends using always a pen to draw in this style so that you can t erase what you ve created it s okay if the drawing looks different from what you ve expected it would be or if you make mistakes use your sense of harmony to fix the composition without eraser do not give up until you feel the drawing is complete 9 x research source deciding when the drawing is complete is entirely up to you you can stop whenever you can t think of anything else to add to the drawing the best judge here is your sense of harmony draw several patterns you can dive into creating the egg if you d like but if you are a beginner it s okay to start by generating ideas by drawing patterns take out a piece of paper and a pen never use a pencil fill the paper with several separate and unique patterns you can use those patterns to fill in your egg when you re ready 10 x research source for example you can draw repeated diamonds circles swirls curvy lines and triangles draw an egg shape on paper once you ve come up with some patterns draw the shape of an egg on a piece of paper you should only draw the basic outline and the inside of the egg should be empty it s okay if the shape isn t perfect but you can redraw it if you aren t happy with the first shape 11 x research source fill the egg with lines and patterns you can put some thought into this if you are a beginner or do it entirely without putting conscious effort into what you re drawing section your egg off by drawing several lines so that you create spaces for your patterns then fill those spaces with patterns like the ones you practiced don t stop until the entire egg has been filled unless you want to leave white space 12 x research source paint your pattern onto a wooden egg your artwork can be finished when you complete the egg on paper or you can use that egg as a base for a wooden egg this isn t necessary but it is a way to show off and display what you ve created take a wooden egg and acrylic paint in the colors of your choice use a thin paintbrush to paint patterns all over the wooden egg wait a few minutes for the paint to dry and then finish by spraying it with a clear varnish 13 x research source it s also an option to use transfer paper if you don t want to start the sketch over completely you can also use a marker or pen to draw on the egg if you don t want to use paint,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to capture a big world in small sketches,in your daily rounds do you see noteworthy things that inspire your creativity carry a pencil and paper and record those images by hand you will employ artist s license to give things your own flair so your work will be the opposite of a photograph things seen and documented with your own eyes and hands become part of you years later your drawings will continue to speak to you and transport you back to that moment in time no matter how simple they might be you will feel pleased to have done them,make sure you have all the right tools on hand a no 2 pencil a pencil sharpener pieces of paper or a small pocket size spiral bound sketch book optional a stick of sanguine rust colored conte crayon a medium gray pastel stick a charcoal pencil a

you will not be disturbed as you think and work engage all your senses and open yourself let things come to you jot down in words your impressions lose the fear of a blank page by describing the scene in words record your impressions you could list the specifics of your situation at that moment your location weather wind temperature etc just start making marks on the paper whatever it takes to help you open the eye to hand connection and get those lines flowing pretend you are a camera and focus on a striking image the world abounds with eye catching things once you begin this activity you will be inundated with material worth documenting on paper just the process of singling out an image and recording it brings it to life go outside to take in nature trees tree tops branch patterns tree trunks with differing bark how trees are connected to the ground etc the sky clouds layers of color or shades of value from white to grays to black sturdy weeds seed pods grasses tiny flowering plants rocks pebbles etc flowers shrubs wild flowers planted flowers in all stages of growth look at man made offerings cast off paper bits of thrown away junk on the ground park benches seats boats buildings cars bikes walkways bridges fences walls etc are rich material at home pick what interests you by working in a series you might explore the facets of a single thing for example your morning coffee accouterments and routine you might want to celebrate a particular food or fruit you can make a visual collection of random images open yourself go with it when stumped begin with a single

how to sign a painting,adding a signature to your painting will make it easier for people to identify you as the artist even after your painting has been sold and moved around the signature on your painting should be legible and clear without being a distraction you want it to blend in and match the rest of your painting so it doesn t look out of place by taking the time to come up with a good signature and choosing the right spot for it you can ensure you get the credit for your artwork that you deserve,sign your painting with your full name or last name avoid signing with your initials or a monogram or people may not be able to identify you as the artist even if some people recognize your initials or monogram now other people might not and your painting could eventually become unidentifiable if your full or last name isn t on it 1 x research source use a signature that s easy to read if people can t read your signature they won t be able to identify you as the artist it s true that some famous artists have illegible signatures but they can get away with it because a lot of people in the art world are familiar with them if your signature is illegible future owners of your painting will have a hard time finding out who you are 2 x research source practice signing a legible signature on a piece of paper then show a few friends and ask if they can read it if they can t work on making it easier to read use the same signature on all of your paintings that way people will start to recognize your signature overtime which will make your artwork easier to identify if your signature is always different people might not realize your paintings were made by the same artist if you don t like the signature you ve used in the past come up with a new one now and use it on all your future paintings 3 x research source avoid using an eye catching signature a signature that is too bold can take away from the rest of your painting your signature should be noticeable enough that people looking for it can find it but not so noticeable that it s the first thing people s eyes are drawn to an easy way to make your signature blend in is to paint it using a color that appears a lot in your painting 4 x research source sign in a bottom corner of your painting if you want a traditional signature you can sign in the left or right bottom corner although signing in the right bottom corner is more common if you do sign in the bottom corner place your signature 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm from the edge of your painting that way if your painting is framed your signature won t be covered up 5 x research source sign somewhere inside of the painting if you want a less obvious signature you could place your signature inside of an object in your painting or have it going vertically up the side of something if you do place your signature inside of your painting make sure it blends in by keeping it small and using a color that matches the colors around it 6 x research source for example if your painting features a bowl of apples you could place your signature inside one of the apples and paint it a shade of red so it blends in put your full name on the back if your signature isn t your full name then people can check the back of your painting for your full name if you only have your last name on the front this will make it easier for someone to identify you as the artist later on 7 x research source sign your painting right after you finish it this will help your signature blend in with the rest of your painting if you wait for your painting to dry before you sign it your signature will stand out more and look like it was added later on also collectors prefer paintings where the signature was added at the time the painting was finished because they are harder to forge 8 x research source sign your painting using the same medium you painted it with using the same medium will help your signature blend in with the rest of your painting avoid using a different medium to sign your signature or it could clash with your painting and look out of place 9 x research source for example if you used watercolor paints to make your painting you should use watercolor paints to sign your signature if you made your painting with oil paints you wouldn t want to paint your signature with acrylic paint add the year you made the painting to your signature it will help you and future owners of your art keep track of when it was painted right after you sign your name put the year you made the painting if you don t want the year on the front paint it on the back so people can reference it 10 x research source you can abbreviate the year if you want for example instead of signing 2017 you could just put 17,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to critique artwork,an art critique is a detailed analysis and evaluation of a work of art while no two people will experience the same reaction to a work of art or interpret it the same way there are a few basic guidelines you can follow to achieve a thoughtful thorough critique the basic elements of an art critique are description analysis interpretation and judgment,gather basic information about the work this is the sort of thing you d find on a museum or gallery label or in the caption in an art book knowing the background of a piece can make a big difference in how you interpret and understand it start your critique by providing the following information title of the work artist s name when the piece was created where it was made the types of media used to create the work e g oil paint on canvas the exact size of the work describe what you see using neutral terms describe the artwork your description should include things like the form and scale of the work if the art depicts figures or objects rather than abstract shapes describe what is represented 1 x research source for example you might say this is a small scale portrait painting of a young woman shown from the mid torso up against a dark background she is clasping her hands in front of her chest and looking up and slightly to the viewer s right she wears a pink dress and a long veil that falls behind her head avoid using terms like beautiful ugly good or bad at this point you re just talking about what you see not judging the art discuss the elements of the work now describe the work in more detail talk about the way the art uses these five basic elements of art and design line color space light and shape 2 x research source describe the use of line lines in a work of art can be either literal or implied different types of lines can create different moods or effects for example 3 x research source curved lines can create a calming effect while jagged lines might feel harsher and wild or create a sense of energy rough sketchy lines create a sense of movement and freedom while smooth solid lines feel more still and carefully planned a line of sight or action might be suggested by the arrangement of figures and objects within a scene for example a group of figures all looking or pointing the same way can create an implied line that draws your eye through the work in a particular direction talk about how color is used in the work make note of characteristics like hue red green blue etc value lightness or darkness and intensity look at overall color schemes and think about how the colors work together 4 x research source for example do the colors clash or are they harmonious does the work use a variety of colors or is it monochromatic all shades of blue for example describe the use of space in the work space refers to the areas around and between objects in a work when talking about space focus on things like depth and perspective overlapping of objects and the use of empty space versus space crowded with details 5 x research source if you are describing a two dimensional work of art like a painting talk about whether or not the work creates the illusion of three dimensional space and depth describe the use of light in the work light in a work of art can look warm or cool bright or dim natural or artificial take a little time to talk about the role of light and shadow in the work 6 x research source if you re talking about a two dimensional work like a painting your focus might be on how the artist creates the illusion of light for a three dimensional work like a sculpture you could discuss how actual light interacts with the work for example is the surface reflective does the sculpture cast interesting shadows are some parts of the sculpture more shadowed or well lit than others make note of the way shape is used in the work are the shapes in the work geometric with straight lines and perfect curves or are they more natural is the work dominated by any one particular type of shape or do you see a variety of different shapes 7 x research source shapes play an important role in both abstract and representative works for instance in a portrait of a bride by james sant there are notable triangle shapes made by the drape of the bride s veil around her shoulders and the clasped hands in front of her chest once you notice one shape in a painting look to see if it is repeated anywhere else discuss how the work uses the principles of composition once you have described the work it s time to analyze it or discuss how it all comes together start by talking about how the work is composed keeping a few basic ideas in mind for example 8 x research source balance how do the colors shapes and textures in the piece work together do they create a balanced or harmonious effect or is the piece imbalanced in some way contrast does the work make use of contrasting colors textures or lighting contrast can also be found in the use of different shapes or contours like jagged versus curved lines or geometric versus natural shapes movement how does the work create a sense of movement is your eye drawn through the composition in a particular way proportion do the sizes of the different elements in the work appear the way you would expect or are they surprising for example if the work shows a group of people do any of the figures look larger or smaller than they would in real life identify the point s of focus of the work most works of art have one or more points that are designed catch your attention and draw your eye in a portrait this may be the face or eyes of the subject in a still life it could be a centrally placed or well lit object try to identify which parts of the work are emphasized 9 x research source look at the work and make note of which feature s jump out at you right away or keep drawing your eye back to them ask yourself why your eye is attracted to the feature s in question for example if you find yourself fixating on one figure in a group is it because that figure is larger than the others are they closer to the viewer more brightly lit look for themes in the work identify a few key themes and discuss how the artist used the elements of design color light space shape and line to express these themes themes might include things like 10 x research source the use of a color scheme to give the work a particular mood or meaning see for example the paintings of picasso s blue period 11 x research source symbolism and religious or mythological imagery for example look at the use of figures and symbols from classical mythology in renaissance works like botticelli s birth of venus 12 x research source repeating images or motifs within a work or group of works for a good example of this look at how plants and flowers are used in many of the paintings of frida kahlo 13 x research source try to identify the purpose of the work in other words what do you think the artist was trying to say with the work why did they create the work try to summarize the overall meaning of the work as you see it describe your own reaction to the work now it s time to get a little more subjective think about how you feel while looking at the work what do you think is the overall mood of the work does it remind you of anything ideas experiences other works of art 14 x research source use expressive language to talk about your reaction to the work for example is the mood of the work sad hopeful peaceful would you describe the work as beautiful or ugly back up your interpretation with examples use examples from your description and analysis of the work to explain why you think and feel the way you do about the piece for example i believe that james sant s portrait of a young bride is intended to give a sense of the bride s spiritual devotion this is indicated by the line of the composition which draws the viewer s eye upward following the upward gaze of the subject it is also suggested by warm light coming from a source somewhere above the young woman decide whether you think the work is successful or not your goal here isn t necessarily to decide whether the art is good or bad instead focus on whether you think the work is successful for example think about the following do you think the work says what the artist wanted it to say did the artist use their tools and techniques well is the art original or does it imitate other works explain how you are judging the work once you have decided on a few aspects of the work to judge clearly state the focus of your evaluation for example you might say that you are judging the piece on how well organized it is how well done it is technically and how successfully it portrays the intended mood or themes summarize why you think the work is successful or unsuccessful in a few sentences explain your judgment of the work give specific reasons for your judgment using your interpretation and analysis of the work for example i believe this work is successful because the use of light shape gesture and line all work together harmoniously to portray the mood of the subject,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to identify a painting,learning more about a piece of famous art is easy but identifying an unknown or obscure painting can be kind of tricky there are so many paintings in existence that the odds of finding information about a specific image can feel insurmountable luckily you can dramatically narrow down your search by assessing the composition subject matter and style start by using an image recognition app and reverse image search museums and art historians are in a perpetual effort to upload and catalogue paintings and artists online so it may be easier than you think to find the information you re looking for,use an image recognition app to identify the painting immediately if you re struggling to remember an artist s name or you want additional information on a particular painting download an image recognition app designed specifically for art there are several apps for both android and iphone that allow you to snap a photo of a painting to search through museum catalogues university databases and art history texts this is the easiest way to find a specific painting 1 x research source the two most popular apps for recognizing artwork are smartify and magnus both of these apps will pull up information about the work s artist as well as interesting facts and background information about the composition these apps only have access to paintings that have been well documented and catalogued by curators professors historians and other artists if the painting is made by a more obscure artist these apps may not work run a reverse image search if you have a digital copy of the painting if you re looking at a painting on your computer or phone run a reverse image search copy and paste the image s url into the search engine run the search to pull up other websites displaying the painting this will give you access to a variety of websites that will tell you everything you need to know about the painting 2 x research source if you re using google chrome you can right click an image and select search google for this image to search the web you can download an image and upload it to the engine instead of copying and pasting the url if you prefer the most popular reverse image search is tineye but there are several options available online use the signature or monogram to dig online and find the image look in the corners of the painting to see if there is a signature or monogram if the name is easy to read simply search the artist s name up online to find the painting if it s harder to read look carefully to see if you can break down the letters and read them this will let you narrow down the search and figure out who the artist is which can make it easier to find your specific painting 3 x research source a monogram refers to a 2 to 3 letter design containing the artist s initials monograms tend to be more popular among painters working after the 1800s signatures were almost never used before the renaissance which began around 1300 even if you can t identify a signature at least you have a baseline for your search 4 x research source you have to sign up for a free account to use it but you can use https artistssignatures com to reverse search for an artist s signature this is useful if you think you can read the signature but want to double check to make sure you aren t misreading it ask an expert to identify the era style or painter of an image email or visit a museum curator art history professor or gallery owner to ask if they can take a look at the image an expert in the field of art will be able to offer insights about the period style and give you a better sense for where to look they may even know who the artist is as soon as they take a look at it 5 x research source if you re contacting a gallery owner try to find a gallery that specializes in the type of art you re trying to identify for example a contemporary abstract piece is going to be easier to identify if the gallery owner mainly focuses on newer artists use obvious clues in the subject matter to narrow down the date contemporary painters may paint people or objects from the past but they can t time travel if there s a train company logo digital clock or some other time specific component of the painting this is a great way to set a baseline for your search you can get a good overall sense for when a painting may have been made simply by asking yourself when an artist would have painted their subject for example there aren t many painters alive today painting portraits of spanish aristocrats from the 1600s and absolutely nobody was painting images of elvis presley before 1954 for example if there is a small airplane in the background of the painting you know that the painting must have been made after 1903 since that s when wilbur and orville wright first successfully flew a plane identify the artistic movement by assessing the style of the painting there are various artistic movements throughout history that share similar qualities determining the movement associated with an image is a great way to quickly narrow down your search since historians group artists from the same movement together 6 x research source there are hundreds of movements if you can t figure out the movement at first glance look through museum catalogues and online collections to find similar paintings determine if the artist used acrylic paint to see if it was made after 1940 get as close as you possibly can to the image if the color looks flat and the darker colors don t reflect light it s probably oil paint if the color is reflective shiny and looks kind of plastic it is likely acrylic paint acrylic paint wasn t used in art until 1940 so you have a much smaller period to search through 7 x research source if more than one medium was used to produce a work it is highly likely that the image was created after 1900 it was fairly rare before this period to combine multiple materials to produce a painting this is a lot harder to do if you re looking at a digital image but if the colors are almost supernaturally bright or neon the painting was probably made with acrylic assess the quality of the canvas or paper to determine the date if the canvas is stapled into the frame uniformly it is unlikely to have been made before 1900 which is when canvases were first mass produced you can also assume the painting is relatively newer if it s is on paper and there s no tearing damage or general wear and tear paper is relatively fragile and it s unlikely that a fresh piece of paper is particularly old 8 x research source if the canvas is hanging loosely on the frame the painting may have been made prior to 1600 before 1600 most artists weren t particularly good at stretching the fabric tight against the frame search through websites and catalogues after narrowing the search if you know you re looking for art from a specific time period or movement go online and search through galleries and websites related to this type of art look for paintings that are similar in style color and composition you can also go through museum databases and encyclopedias to find your image to do this as well with enough luck you ll find the artist 9 x research source almost every major museum has an online dataset that you can search search through these catalogues to find similar pieces that may belong to your artist once you have the artist finding the specific painting is fairly easy museums and universities often catalogue and document the entire body of work for well known painters so you should be able to find the specific painting just by poking around online inspect the back of the painting to find notes from previous owners if you really can t find anything about an image in your possession using traditional search methods flip the canvas over and look at the back if the image is a print or reproduction it may be listed on the back if the painting is a family heirloom or was bought at a thrift shop there may be a handwritten note describing where the painting is from 10 x research source use the other steps in this method first before looking for lesser known details it s possible that the painting is a reproduction print or mass produced version of a popular painting if you see 2 3 numbers listed in a corner the painting was probably purchased at a thrift shop or resale store the employees of these stores often write the price on a back of a work you re unlikely to be able to identify the artist or image in this case check the frame to see if you can find a manufacturer inspect the frame on the back and look for an imprint or label frame manufacturers often print a company name on the back if there is a name contact the manufacturer to learn more about the frame itself this can drastically narrow down the region and time period where a painting was produced 11 x research source if you only have the canvas and there is no frame check the wood portion of the canvas on the back prior to 1900 most artists stretched their own canvases if there is a signature on the wood frame it s probably the artist s this isn t really a helpful option if the painting is well known or really old since it was likely re framed at some point take a large collection from an unknown painter to an art dealer if you stumble on a large number of paintings and you can t find a single thing about the artist online or through close inspection contact an art dealer many lifelong artists paint simply because they enjoy it and it s possible that you may have stumbled on to a unique collection from a totally unknown artist 12 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to find your own art style,when it comes to your artwork your style changes and develops as you grow as an artist to find your own art style learn the basics of whatever type of art you practice such as painting drawing sculpture or printmaking make lots and lots of artwork and then take a step back and look for similarities present in all of them once you see which elements tends to pop up in all of your pieces you ve found your style,explore different artistic genres for style inspiration begin looking through different examples of art to find styles that you re interested in replicating or learning from you can do this by doing an online search looking through art books reading articles about up and coming artists or visiting art museums 1 x research source study individual artists whose style you admire once you ve explored different kinds of art pick out artists with unique styles that you really like to become your style mentors research this artist to find out more about their work process where they gather inspiration and the methods and tools they use to create new pieces 2 x research source study a large collection of art from one specific artist to understand the similarities between each of their pieces look to see if the artist has a social media site where they upload videos or posts about their work or methods combine your favorite elements from other artists into your own art once you find artwork that you re passionate about start practicing replicating the work you shouldn t copy the artist s work exactly but choose elements that you like most and incorporate them into your own art so that you begin learning the technique 3 x research source for example if you find another artist s nature drawings that you admire and want to create your own nature drawings use the artist s work as a guide and practice drawing mountains trees or bodies of water similar to their work hone your interest in a specific type of art choose a medium that you truly love and focus your energy into delving deeply into all of its possibilities while you can always play around with different mediums picking one type of art whether it s painting drawing sculpture ceramics or another type will help you develop a specific style more efficiently 4 x research source feel free to try out different types of art until you find one you love for example you can explore painting by studying color theory creating work in black and white vs in full color and trying a wide range of subject matter such as still lives the human form and abstraction master the basic technical skills you need before worrying about style before you dive into your own unique style it s important to set the groundwork study things such as how colors combine to make intriguing works of art and how light works as well as the basics of your intended type of art 5 x research source if you re into drawing practice drawing anatomy and still lives if you want to develop your own style of pottery begin by making a simple bowl or vase challenge yourself by always trying new methods try to step out of your comfort zone and test out new ways of creating your art use different materials create on both a large and small scale and study lots of different subject matter this will help you figure out which methods you love most 6 x research source for example create sculptures out of clay wire metal paper mache and any other material you find practice drawing using a single stroke without taking your pencil off the page and then practice using small tight strokes paint on super tiny canvases as well as canvases stretching 3 4 feet 36 48 in embrace your mistakes if you re working on a piece of art and do something like make a wrong brushstroke or mess up your clay sculpture see what you can create out of the mistake instead of casting it aside mistakes often lead to the discovery of new techniques or methods and they might even help improve your style 7 x research source learn from constructive criticism it s helpful to show your artwork to others as you create it to see what they think ask a friend family member or even someone you don t know well to look at your art and give you helpful feedback listen to what they have to say and use it to help you improve your art for example if you show your illustrations to someone and they say they re a bit 2 dimensional work on making your art more 3 dimensional ask the person questions like what does this piece of art remind you of or which elements of this artwork are working and which do you think need improvement follow a passion in your artwork find something you re curious about want to explore or wish to advocate for and use this interest as a basis for your artwork this will help give your artwork a specific direction and focus allowing you to use your voice as an artist to develop your own style 8 x research source for example if you love the ocean and are passionate about marine life study the shapes and colors of the waves and mimic this movement in your artwork pay attention to which elements continuously appear in your own art once you ve created at least 10 15 pieces of artwork take a step back and look for similarities between them which colors textures themes and techniques tend to show up the most these are things that indicate your specific style as an artist 9 x research source for example maybe all of your work tends to stay in the same color scheme or you use very fluid brush strokes as opposed to straight rigid ones perhaps you find yourself wanting to only draw realistic urban cityscapes or mostly create sculptures representing an issue in the environment explore the recurring elements more deeply to progress as an artist after you ve recognized which things reappear in each of your pieces practice developing those elements into more advanced pieces you can do this by trying out different alterations of the elements finding other renditions of your style that you also like 10 x research source for example if you ve noticed that you create prints consisting of lots of simple shapes try arranging the simple shapes in a pattern or obscuring them in some way practice developing your style every day by making lots of art the best way to develop your style is to make art every single day or at least a few times a week finding your art style is a process and the only way it will emerge is if you re constantly creating and trying new things 11 x research source try to put aside 30 minutes to an hour each day to create art whether it s sketching right before bedtime or practicing mixing certain paint colors avoid limiting yourself to one type of style your style will likely change and evolve as you grow as an artist so try not to box yourself into one idea or style don t think too much about making art that fits with your specific style and instead just let your art evolve naturally 12 x research source for example if you ve developed a style of painting that mostly only uses bold colors don t be afraid to incorporate small amounts of black and white into your artwork to see how it looks,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to cut a picture mat,mats are used in framing photographs and artwork to center the focus of the picture and give it a sense of spatial depth the addition of a sleek well cut mat can greatly enhance the look of any framed picture but having a mat cut and frame made commercially can sometimes cost more than the picture itself a cheaper solution is to learn to cut your own mat frames using a handful of basic materials that allow you to fully customize the look of your framed picture for a fraction of the cost,have the picture you want to frame ready take a look at the picture and get an idea of what size mat and or frame you ll need the completed project will consist of your picture sandwiched between two uniformly sized mats with the center of the frontal mat cut to display the picture you ll need at least two pieces of mat board one to serve as the backing for the picture and the other to cut a window frame that wraps around the front side of the picture larger pictures like artwork headed for exhibition will obviously require larger mats but the exact specifications of the mat will also depend on how much of it you want to be visible around the picture decide on a style of mat that you like mats come in many different colors designs and thicknesses pick a mat or a number of mats if you choose to utilize multiple layers you like that is a good look for the picture you ll be framing then decide whether the mat will go around the edges of the picture in the frame or serve as a frame itself if you think the picture you re framing might benefit from the added depth of multiple layered window frame mats select the mats in color and texture combinations that complement each other 1 x research source mat board comes in many different thicknesses the thicker the mat you choose for cutting the wider and deeper the white line created by the mat s inner material will be around the edges of the finished piece consequently thicker mat types might look better in plain white to hide the cut inner edges mat board is also available in two general quality ranges standard mat board is fine for photographs and prints that aren t meant to be professionally displayed while archival mat board is exhibition quality and therefore costs more archival mat board should be used with original artwork especially when they re done on archival materials with artist grade art supplies choose a cutting implement to cut the mat you ll need a sharp blade capable of cutting perfectly straight lines the most readily available and least expensive option is a standard razor blade or box cutter with a fixed handle you can also purchase a specialty sliding mat cutter tool but these tend to be more costly and require more of a learning curve to use without making mistakes razor blades x acto knives and box cutters all make use of extremely sharp exposed blades be very cautious when handling these tools mat cutting kits can be purchased at most art stores and make it easier to measure align and cut mats in a single station but will run you considerably more money 2 x research source acquire a ruler or t square the ruled edge will be used to measure the mat to fit the picture and frame and to assist in cutting straight edges the t square has the added benefit of enabling you to measure precise angles you ll also need the ruler or t square to keep the width of all sides of the mat consistent heavy metal rulers will work better as they provide some weight to hold the mat steady beneath them and you won t have to worry about damaging them with your cutting tool measure the picture you want to frame use the ruler to measure the height and width of the picture you ll be cutting the mat to fit both of the mats you cut should match the dimension of the picture exactly the inner area of the second window frame mat will need to be cut at least a half inch smaller than the picture itself to hold it in place write down the picture s dimensions and set it aside for now during this step you can decide how wide you want to cut your window mat to go on top of the picture if only a portion of the picture needs to be visible a wider mat will fill in the non focal area around the edges and let you center the picture exactly where you want it measure the frame if you have a frame picked out that you want to use remove the glass or plastic from the front and extract the backing board the backing board is what you will be using for reference as the mats will be measured and cut to fit the inner part of the frame where the picture sits copy down the dimensions of the frame making sure to differentiate what the various measurements are for 3 x research source most frames you buy will already have their specifications listed disregard this measurement and take your own since it s imperative that the mat you cut be able to fit the frame it s better not to take chances with sizing choose a size for the window mat with the dimensions of the picture or artwork in mind decide what size will work best for cutting the window mat the window mat will be placed around the edges of the front side of the picture and will usually overlap the picture slightly so settle on a window mat size that doesn t obscure too much of the picture on the back of the second mat board trace the measurements of the picture where you plan to cut the window frame 4 x trustworthy source library of congress official library of the u s and main research institution for congress and the american public go to source for most small to medium sized pictures a window mat with a width of around 5 1 5 will provide a nice frame for the picture without covering too much of it mark the first mat where it is to be cut refer back to the dimensions of the frame backing board you measured earlier using these measurements place the ruler or t square along the first edge of the mat and mark with a pencil on the back side of the mat where the cutting edge is to be start at the top edge of the mat and make a small notch every few inches this will give you a dotted line to follow as you cut and can help you realign the cutting trajectory if the ruler is to slip at any point always mark and cut from the back side of the mat that way none of your marks or cutting imperfections will be visible on the finished mat surface cut the first backing mat take the razor box cutter or mat cutter tool and line it up with the edge of the ruler make sure the cutting edge is flush with the ruler if you re using a mat cutter tool it will be a sliding attachment with its own ruled edge to ensure that the cutter doesn t slip when cutting manually be sure to press firmly against the ruler or t square to keep it from moving as you cut cut the mat with a slow steady motion applying equal pressure throughout the whole movement repeat the cutting process on the remaining three sides of the mat checking again that the length and width are accurate and that you re cutting the right amount 5 x research source bear down hard when cutting the mat it s best to go all the way through on the first pass to keep the cut clean and straight but if that s not possible then make several lighter passes watching for crooked cuts to continue a cut that is only partially complete push down vertically with your blade until you go all the way through adjust the angle of the blade and resume cutting remember safety first severe injury can result from improper use of cutting tools cut slowly and keep all appendages out of the path of the blade cut the second window frame mat cut the second mat board to the exact specifications of the first you ll be using this mat as the window frame for the front of the picture if you ve selected a mat of a fanciful color or design it should be the one you use for the window mat as it will be front and center in the frame and complement the aesthetic of the picture once again let the ruler edge guide you as you carefully cut out the four sides of the window frame the outer dimensions of the window frame should be the same of the backing mat as they will be fitted together the inner dimensions are a matter of preference but generally a 5 1 5 window frame looks best create layered mats if you want to create a more complex layered look cut multiple window frame mats each approximately 5 to 1 smaller than the previous one arrange the mats concentrically around the picture when using layered mats you can alternate various colors or designs making the space around the picture deeper and more ornate 6 x research source when layering mats be sure that you re measuring and cutting each mat separately and unless it s part of the design keep the size variations between the mats consistent secure the mats place the picture against the backing mat and then center the window frame mat over it once you ve lined up both mats and made sure the picture is centered take small strips of artist s tape and lightly stick the mat halves together flip the matted picture over and tape across the back edges you can then remove the strips of tape from the front and the mats will be secured around the picture that s it insert the newly matted picture into the frame or let the mats act as a rough frame themselves if you prefer stick the tape to a piece of fabric before applying it to the mat if the tape is too tacky you might tear the mat or picture when removing it it s recommended that you find an actual covered frame for original artwork once it s been matted otherwise you risk damaging or smudging the art if it s left exposed,Arts-and-Entertainment

statement can be a difficult process but it is also an enormously valuable exercise as it can help you to achieve a greater understanding of yourself as an artist here is a helpful guide to steer you in the right direction,be honest with yourself before you write a word take some time to just think about you and your art you need to understand what it is that you are trying to achieve before you

and how they manifest themselves in your work try to be as specific as possible 2 x research source make a mind map mind mapping is a good way to free your thinking it will also help you to trace the relationship between different ideas jot down a key idea that informs your work in the center of a blank page then spend 15 minutes writing down any words phrases feelings techniques etc related to that idea free writing is another technique that can help get the creative juices going spend 5 10 minutes writing whatever pops into your head when you think about your art you ll be amazed at what

how to become a better artist,being an artist includes continuously evolving your skills improving your technique and pushing yourself beyond the next boundary it s part of your growth as an artist and can even see you changing your artistic techniques completely several times during a lifetime becoming a better artist is a journey and will bring greater satisfaction to you as you continue to build on what you already know,buy all of the necessary supplies drawing pencils erasers sketchbook pastels paint an easel whatever you think you will need for your area of expertise new supplies and mediums can be encouraging try beginner sets of artist grade supplies because they are often easier to use than the cheaper student grade supplies 1 x research source begin with an inexpensive sketchbook with lots of pages and a sketching set that includes kneaded putty eraser and different grades of graphite pencils it may also include charcoal pencils charcoal sticks graphite sticks and brown gray or reddish sketching sticks all these tools are useful and the supplies are cheaper in bundled sets than bought individually h and 2h 4h etc are hard pencils that sharpen to a fine point and give a very light mark easily covered by paint or inking they re for design f is a fine pencil a little harder than an hb which is a normal no 2 pencil and middle hardness b means black and each successive degree of b pencil is softer blacker and smudgier 2b is a good sketch pencil 4b is a great one that gives good shading and 6b or higher is almost like using charcoal for ease of smudging and shading 2 x research source purchase some how to drawing books this includes books on specific subjects like how to draw animals how to draw horses how to draw seascapes etc whatever you like most or get interested in try to accomplish at least one drawing a day you can even frame them and put them up on your walls to inspire you to keep going through the next day you can also check out drawing books from your local library and find out which one inspires you the most before buying it work through each of the exercises in turn rather than trying to do everything in the book at once date your daily sketches they don t need to be complex or difficult a five minute gesture sketch is as useful for learning to draw as a half hour spent doing a detailed drawing if you have a half hour spending it on half a dozen shorter sketches will actually give better practice try to get it right but don t worry about perfection you ll achieve good recognizable drawings by constant practice more than anything else 3 x research source choose a favorite subject this might be your favorite animal a favorite flower a rock a bottle with light coming through it anything you would really like to draw well and care about personally draw the same thing over and over many times in many different ways repeated drawing of the same subject or type of subject each of your cats your cat from several different photos your cat s paw one day your cat s nose the next will give you a much richer grasp of the anatomy and proportions of that subject when you ve drawn your pet cat enough times it becomes easy to sketch a tiger on the first try draw enough pebbles and a mountain becomes easy and understandable sketch and draw anything you see it could be the homeless dude begging for change or the little girl skipping around with a balloon in her hand whatever you see that looks interesting draw or sketch it 4 x research source still life is one of the easiest subjects for beginners to draw literally the objects don t move choose simple ones at first a vase without too many curlicues a few pebbles a flower without too many petals a clear bottle with an interesting shape etc draw each of the objects separately as a study then start arranging them together in different ways to see how they go together the big advantage to still life is that your models don t move and if you do it indoors the light from your lamps doesn t change with the time of day either animal drawing may be your passion start with your pets start when they re sleeping even if that doesn t seem like an exciting pose it s when the animal s more likely to hold still long enough to be drawn use photos of your pets visit zoos with a camera and snap photos of every animal you see and like then work from your own photos look for open source photos like wikipedia commons and other photos where the photographer gives permission to draw from them you can also contact photographers who take good animal photos and post them on flickr or facebook asking permission to draw from their photos many will be happy to give permission and most will want to see your drawings when you re used to drawing animals fast from life try drawing at the zoo or wildlife like the birds at your feeder life drawing of animals is a good way to learn to do quick gestures and detail them later buildings and architecture study perspective as it s important in buildings more than anything else to make them look real find a good book on perspective and do all the exercises be careful about working from photos because they will sometimes distort vertical lines and alter perspective you may have to correct the photo once you understand what you re doing this is another popular fine art subject that never loses its appeal like still life you can go out and draw buildings in person without your model getting up to walk away 5 x research source landscapes are a traditional fine art subject sketch your own yard from life often sometimes a small beautiful area sometimes trying for the big panoramic view go out on camping trips or visit local parks with your sketchbook in hand do several quick five minute or less gesture sketches to get the main elements of your landscape design down just rough outlines then pick the best small thumbnail and draw that view larger this saves a host of troubles over starting with the details of a leaf and only finishing one branch of that tree in an hour details are actually easier than doing the big shapes of things landscape drawing is about textures shapes and light that changes quickly so learn to draw fast get the shapes of shadows down first thing because the angle of the light will change in half an hour and so will the shape of the shadows people are a popular subject for drawing start with the friends and family members you can convince to sit still for a half hour or more to let you draw them paint the ones you love sketch anyone who interests you again practice quick small gesture drawings in public so that you can get the gist of a figure or a face within a few minutes before the person wanders off or does something else sketching in public is also a great ice breaker a good way to meet people because someone often wanders up to see what you re drawing you have a topic to talk about right away art one that most people like and one that isn t controversial look into art lessons of some sort most places offer community classes where you can sign up to take some art lessons just know that you will have to invest a bit of money but it certainly will help look for art lessons online and art videos or dvds many professional artists create instructional dvds in various mediums or on drawing in general websites with forums like http www wetcanvas com will often have free art lessons with volunteer teachers who give assignments critique your work and help in encouraging ways sites like http how to draw and paint com may have a lot of free instruction available and downloadable e books as well as further instruction for sale try before you buy with online art lessons some are as good or better than in person art instruction you should like the teacher s art and also enjoy the teacher s style of presentation to get the most out of an online class 6 x research source subscribe to art instruction magazines the artist s magazine pastel journal watercolor artist american artist and others all have excellent articles on how to draw and paint the more you read the more you ll understand the many technical terms and different techniques there are to drawing and painting learning art is cumulative it may seem easy because people who do something well for a long time do it easily but it s a complex field of study that takes time and effort to master patience practice and study are what really constitutes talent talent is loving the process so much that you re willing to put up with your mistakes in order to learn how to do it so well others call you talented this usually comes at the point they can recognize what you drew for what it is learn composition and design look for books on design and composition take classes in design study it as much as you do how to draw things accurately it makes the difference between whether you create great art or just copies of photos learn how to crop reference photos choose which subjects to shoot or sketch in a landscape guide a viewer s attention in the painting to the most important thing in it a portrait s eyes the sunlit patch in a landscape that you chose as a focal point the animal bending to drink the people on the beach some subjects are attention getters by themselves like a cute kitten but you can improve on that cute kitten picture to the point it s irresistible if you learn good design principles and give just the right balance of background space around it 7 x research source get a job if you are old enough it could be at a craft store like joanne s or michael s or you could be an intern at some sort of design studio get to know a gallery owner and volunteer to help with setting up shows and you may eventually be hired to work at the gallery alternately sell your art online at ebay or etsy sell portraits or pet portraits or landscapes in person off the easel bring your portfolio to galleries sell at art fairs or science fiction or media conventions 8 x research source what type of art you do will affect where it sells best and whether you re ready to make a living at art yet the point at which good art supplies pay for themselves comes very fast whenever you master at least one popular subject that non artists like your work this can be cartoon cats dragons cute manga animals or cute manga kids as easily as a fine art subject someone will offer to buy something sell it give them that joy even if you know you could have done it better the connection they have with your drawing is real and emotional your technical criticism has more to do with your growth as an artist and less to do with the external value of your art you re often its poorest judge don t undersell yourself to make a living in art learn how to become self employed there are many aspects to self employment that have nothing to do with how well you draw and paint everything to do with how well you manage your money and time if you prefer to set your own schedule make all your own business and financial decisions work well without supervision plan schedule and complete major projects without any outside authority the life of a full time self employed artist may be right for you if it s not then enjoy having a side income and look for a related job where you have an employer a steady check benefits and someone else responsible for all the business stuff how much you need to earn to be happy in life is a lifestyle choice if you have your health you may not need a high income to be happy as a full time artist if you have dependents or health issues it may not be practical to go full time until you can earn a professional level income pursue your career part time till it matches your job income 9 x research

avoiding a certain piece are they drawn to some pieces more than others which pieces are generating conversation what types of comments do you overhear if you re planning to publish your review ask fellow visitors to give you quotes that you can use for your review get their name so you can credit them talk to the artist if they re present at the exhibit if you attend on opening night you may meet the artist if so chat with them about what inspired their work what they hope the audience will experience and how they created their work take notes on what they say so you can use this information to write your review 7 x research source wait until after you view the exhibit so that your initial impressions aren t influenced by the artist read other reviews on the exhibition to find out what critics are saying do a quick internet search to find out what other critics are saying about the exhibit if it s a traveling exhibit look at the reviews from prior installations use their ideas to help you complete your own analysis of the exhibit but make sure you draw your own conclusions 8 x research source your review should focus on your own ideas not on what other people said answer the who what where when and why this will provide your reader with a general overview of the exhibit and where they can find it tell the reader who the artist is what style of art they make where the exhibit is when it takes place and why people might be interested in the show include this information in your paper s introduction 9 x research source write agatha tompkin s the friends you have opened at the contemporary art center on friday august 23rd and runs through november 1st her watercolors and mixed media works explore modern relationships and how communities differ describe the exhibit so visitors know what to expect from it discuss the physical specifications of the art the form and its content additionally explain how the artwork is installed in the gallery such as how it s hung or displayed then specify how visitors can interact with the work 10 x research source you might say tompkin s watercolors are grouped on two adjacent walls in simple 11 by 14 in 28 by 36 cm black frames hanging on the opposite walls her mixed media work consists of 5 by 7 ft 1 5 by 2 1 m canvases that are arranged in a line visitors can walk alongside the artwork for a visual experience present a critical analysis of the exhibit and its thesis discuss your opinions about the exhibit and how well the artist presented their ideas and themes explain whether or not the exhibit provides new interpretations or fails to realize its goal support your analysis with facts or observations from the exhibit 11 x research source explain the artist s stated thesis and how well they expressed it in their exhibit identify parts of the exhibit that worked well if there were works that didn t support the main idea explain how the artist could have better incorporated them consider how this exhibit relates to art history as a whole where would it fit in how does this art compare to existing works how does it express common themes discuss the challenges the curator may have faced during installation you may be able to omit this information if the exhibit was easy to hang however an exhibit that has large pieces moving parts or a wall installation may be hard to hang consider what the curator had to do to install the exhibit and how it may have differed from past shows then explain these challenges in your review 12 x research source for instance a curator may not face any unique challenges while hanging framed oil paintings on a wall however they might struggle with installing a sculpture that hangs from the ceiling or an installation that has moving parts you might write while the framed watercolors were easy to hang on the exhibit walls the curators struggled to install the single mixed media sculpture that tompkins created from found objects the sculpture is designed to look like it s floating between the ceiling and the floor so it must be hung using thin wires follow the formatting instructions for your assignment use the formatting instructions provided by your instructor or publisher this might include using standard 1 in 2 5 cm margins double spacing and 12 pt times new roman or arial font however check your assignment sheet to make sure 13 x research source if this is for class your instructor likely told you which style guide to use format your paper and any citations that you use according to the rules for that style guide ask a fellow art student or critic to give you feedback on your work give your review to someone who has experience in writing art exhibition reviews so you can get feedback ask them to identify areas that need improvement as well as errors that need to be corrected use their feedback to revise your paper 14 x research source don t ask someone who s unfamiliar with art exhibition reviews to critique your paper because they may unintentionally give you bad advice revise your review if changes are necessary after you get feedback go through your paper and improve areas that aren t working well address areas that the reviewer pointed out but also revise sentences that you think could be better stated 15 x research source reading your review aloud will help you spot areas that don t flow well

how to batik,batik is a javanese method of producing designs on fabric by using a wax resist once the fabric is painted with wax designs it is placed in a dye bath where only the areas with no wax are dyed batik masters can produce complex designs by layering colors and using cracks in the wax to produce fine detail lines even if you are not a master you can get some great effects using just a few materials and a creative spirit,prewash your fabrics use hot water to wash the fabrics in a detergent such as synthrapol 1 x research source to remove chemicals and impurities that can affect dyes dye your fabrics in base colors these base colors are the colors that will show under the wax resist 2 x research source melt your batik wax batik wax comes in a brick that needs to be melted in either an electric wax pot or double boiler 3 x research source use caution with hot wax do not heat it above 240 as it could begin to emit fumes or even catch fire it is not recommended that you heat wax on the stove top wax pots and double boilers heat the wax slowly and at a lower heat stretch your fabric on an embroidery hoop 4 x research source the hoop will keep the fabric taught and stable allowing you to apply wax with greater precision if you are applying designs to large swaths of fabric you can lay newsprint or cardboard on your work surface without stretching it on a hoop the wax will penetrate through the fabric so a protective surface underneath is highly recommended begin to apply the wax with your tools 5 x research source various tools will yield different line qualities so some experimentation beforehand is recommended 6 x research source use a single spouted tjanting tool to draw thin lines and designs it is a standard tool that is very versatile and comes in a variety of spout sizes a double spouted tjanting tool creates parallel lines and can also be used in filling larger areas brushes can also be used to cover large areas they can be used traditionally in broad strokes or as a stippling tool for a dot pattern use stamps for the application of uniform shapes stamps can be made of anything that can take the heat of the wax try carving a potato into a shape or using the end of a celery stalk to stamp out half circles regulate your wax temperature the wax should be hot enough to penetrate through the fabric but not be so hot and thin that it spreads when applied the wax will be clear if it has penetrated to the other side of the fabric get ready to tub dye your fabric when considering which dye colors to use it is recommended that you begin with the lightest colors first like yellow and then move towards darker colors 7 x research source wash your fabric in synthrapol dissolve your dye by following instructions on the package some dyes like reds are harder to dissolve than other add in the appropriate amount of non iodized salt for a 1 2 pound of dry fabric add in 1 1 2 cups of salt for a pound of fabric use 3 cups of salt add in your damp fabric stir gently but frequently for 20 minutes mix up your soda ash soda ash or sodium carbonate is used to bond the dye to the cellulose in fiber dissolve the ash in warm water and add it into the tub slowly over the course of 15 minutes being careful not to dump it directly onto the fabric which could cause discoloration for each 1 2 pound of dry fabric add in 1 6 cups of salt for a pound of fabric use 1 3 cups of salt stir gently but frequently for another 30 minutes rinse you fabric and wash out excess dye run cool water over your fabric until it runs clear then wash it in hot water using synthrapol with some darker colors like red or brown a second washing may be necessary to remove all excess dye allow the fabric to dry repeat another application of wax to add more layers of color and design with every additional layer you wish to add follow the steps for tub dyeing remember to tub dye your darkest colors last remove the wax when you are done with all the color dyeing you may remove the wax in one of two ways 8 x research source boil the wax out fill a pot large enough to hold your fabric with water and a few drops of synthrapol once the water begins to boil add in your fabric and weigh it down with a rock to keep the wax which will be floating at the top from re bonding with the fabric after a few minutes the wax will pull out of the fabric after all the wax appears to be out of the fabric allow the pot to cool completely and peel the wax layer from the top of the pot iron the wax out place the fabric between two sheets of absorbent paper and run the iron over the sandwiched fabric the wax can leave behind a residue so use care to ensure the wax is removed periodically changing out the papers can aid in wax removal wash and dry your fabric throw your fabric into the washing machine with synthrapol one last time to ensure all of the dyes have been released dry your fabric either on a line or in the dryer all batiked 9 x research source spread the plastic on your work surface lay your pre washed and pre dyed fabric over the overlapped sheets of plastic wrap create designs using the washable resist medium as with traditional batiking you may use the single or double spouted tjanting tool to create thin lines for designs use paint brushes to cover larger areas with the medium allow the medium to dry for approximately 30 minutes though exact dry time depends on how thickly the medium was applied consider using stamps dipped in the medium to create a repeat pattern you can use a stencil by placing it down on the fabric and dabbing the medium around it with a foam brush mix up your liquid dye follow the instructions on the package to mix up the dye if you are using a liquid dye adjusting the water to dye ratio can create softer add more water or more vivid colors add more dye apply the dye dyes can be dribbled painted sprayed or dabbed on consider mixing two or more colors together to create color variations 10 x research source cover the fabric with plastic wrap once you have finished with your dye application cover the fabric with plastic wrap and seal the edges nuke your fabric place paper towels on the bottom of the microwave oven to protect against spills place your plastic covered fabric in the microwave oven you may need to fold the fabric and cook on high for 2 minutes 11 x research source remove the fabric from the microwave using thick rubber gloves carefully remove the fabric from the microwave oven the fabric will be hot so use caution allow the fabric to cool for a few minutes before removing the plastic wash and dry your fabric rinse your fabric under cool water until it runs clear after you ve removed the initial dye wash the fabric in warm water with a mild detergent and rinse dry your fabric 12 x research source prewash your silk add a drop or two of liquid dish soap to a tub or bucket of water rinse and dry your fabric 13 x research source while still slightly damp press your fabric with an iron set to the silk setting if you wish to sketch out a design instead of painting it freehand this would be done after ironing stretch your silk apply safety pins connected to rubber bands around the edges of your silk every 4 6 inches 10 2 15 2 cm lay your silk over the frame and begin to apply push pins to the frame the rubber bands will hook around push pins set into the frame to create a taut trampoline the rubber bands should be small enough to maintain good tension but long enough to as to avoid tearing the fabric you can link two rubber bands together to create longer ones if your frame is much larger than the piece of silk the goal is to create a taut surface on which to paint the surface should be taut but should not be too tight that it begins to tear elevate your frame place 4 plastic cups or containers under the frame to raise it off the work surface apply your resist 14 x research source the resist can be applied with a paint brush or through the narrow spout of an applicator bottle allow the resist to dry completely before moving on to color depending on preference there are two type of resists that work well for silk painting rubber based resists or guttae are similar in consistency to rubber cement and can be diluted to a thin consistency useful for drawing finer lines after the color has been set they are removed by dry cleaning the finished fabric the downside of this resist is the fumes it produces it is recommended that you use a respirator in a well ventilated area when applying rubber based gutta water soluble resists are non toxic odorless and wash away in warm water these resists work well in conjunction with silk paints as opposed to dyes which are heat set with heat the downside to this resist is that it s not as free flowing as other guttae and fine details are harder to achieve apply your color carefully apply your dye or paint with a brush allow the color to flow towards an area of resist painting directly on the resist may cause it to dissolve and fill in there are two options when it comes to color silk paints are pigment based products that color the surface of the fabric but do not penetrate into the fabric s fiber these colors can be used on a wide variety of fabrics including synthetics and are set with a dry iron silk dyes color fabric by forming a bond with the fibers in the fabric these are a wonderful choice if you do not want to diminish the natural luster of silk colors are light fast and washable allow your painted silk to set for 24 hours if you have opted for silk paints heat set the color by applying the iron for 2 3 minutes on the back side of the fabric after ironing rinse the silk in warm water hang to dry and iron again while still slightly damp 15 x research source if you used silk dyes after allowing the color to dry for 24 hours rinse the fabric until the water runs clear add a couple of drops of light detergent or dish soap to a bucket or tub and wash the silk rinse again with cool water and hang to dry when the silk is almost dry apply a dry iron heated to the silk setting,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to title your work of art,giving a title to a work of art can be a very complicated process as it reveals another layer of meaning for the artwork conveying the right sense in the right combination of words can be difficult there is no tried and true method of naming a work of art but there are strategies and exercises that can help you pinpoint the best name to represent your hard work and creativity this article will help you to find that perfect name,make a list of themes central to the artwork brainstorm a list of ideas that reflect what your artwork is about it can be simple such as trees or girl but it can also be thematic or subconscious such as friendship or childhood think about what the meaning of the artwork is and how the title can convey that meaning identify your motivation behind the artwork what drove you to create this piece of art reflect on your feelings about this artwork and what you d like to share with your audience how does the artwork make you feel identify the story you want to tell pinpoint the artwork s focal point with artwork there are certain areas of the piece that the artist wants the audience to see first or to pay the most attention to think about the focal point of your artwork what do you want people to focus on when they observe your artwork naming your artwork after the focal point can help people understand your artwork better 1 x research source johannes vermeer s girl with a pearl earring draws attention to the small jewel in the ear of the subject 2 x research source consider what audiences need to know oftentimes titles help audiences understand what they re looking at titles can give tools to the audience to know how to interpret the piece what do you want audiences to know about your artwork 3 x research source do you want your title to direct the viewer towards a particular interpretation for example a work of art of a dog sitting on a beach can be interpreted in a number of ways but if you title the picture abandoned the viewer will assume that the dog has been abandoned on the beach if you title the picture best friend people will react differently to the dog s presence some artists prefer not to tell the meaning of their artwork deliberately leaving the title ambiguous make the title meaningful for yourself no matter your reasoning for choosing a particular title make it meaningful for you you are after all the artist and the artwork is made primarily for yourself some artists like to have titles that convey certain meanings so that they remember certain details about the process of making the artwork what inspired the artwork and so on frida kahlo titled one painting i belong to my owner during a tumultuous affair with exiled communist leo trotsky the painting of wild flowers in a vase symbolizes her overwhelming love for trotsky coupled with her need to remove herself from this affair 4 x research source look for inspiration in poems or quotes using parts of your favorite poem or quote can be an interesting and suitable title for your artwork similarly you could choose a passage from a book these should not however be too lengthy choose something that is a short phrase also choose something that adds to the artwork s meaning not something completely random that doesn t mean anything there shouldn t be copyright issues with this approach unless you are using a lengthy quote if you have just a few words from a poem or book and you are appropriating it in a new way this would likely be protected by fair use guidelines 5 x research source pam farrell titled her painting seasick sailor which were words that she heard in song by both beck and bob dylan david white used titles of books and movies such as the man who knew too much and the man who would be king and repurposed them into titles for a series of paintings one of his paintings is the man who was tired of perpetual war naming the action after the character in his painting 6 x research source ask for suggestions talk with family friends or other artists to get suggestions on a good title they may have some interesting or inspirational ideas that you hadn t thought of alternately throw a titling party with other artists or friends throw a party and display the artwork ask everyone to give suggestions for a title some titling parties demand that all guests stay until suggestions are made and a title is chosen painter jackson pollock would often only number his paintings such as number 27 1950 but the art critic clement greenberg would give the paintings poetic names such as lavender mist or alchemy in order to differentiate among them 7 x research source pay homage to an artistic influence if your artwork or artistic style is particularly influenced by a certain piece of art or artist you could consider naming your work after that paying homage to your influences can be a good source for artwork titles andy warhol created a series of pop culture infused paintings called the last supper as reinterpretations of leonardo da vinci s the last supper 8 x research source look at titles of other works of art observe how other artists name their works of art read the story behind why a particular artwork was given its name read titles for different types of artwork from classical paintings and modern drawings to sculptures and video art look for synonyms of words your title might revolve around a particular theme or topic but you might not like the word choices look up key words in a thesaurus to come up with alternate words that mean the same thing 9 x research source add descriptive words you might have a few key words that describe the theme you want to convey adding descriptive words can give more dimension to your title think of adjectives or adverbs that might work to enhance your title georgia o keeffe titled one painting calla lily turned away giving more description to the floral subject of her work mary cassatt named one painting mrs duffee seated on a striped sofa reading expanding on the most obvious subject to include more details of the painting try different combinations switch around the words that you ve chosen to see how they flow together putting the words in a different order can shift the meaning slightly or it can make it easier to say say the words out loud to hear how they sound together choose a purely descriptive title instead of delving into a complex naming process consider giving your artwork a very simple title that describes exactly what is in the artwork this could be something like wooden table with fruit bowl red ball or girl swinging emily carr titled many of her paintings simply such as breton church and big raven 10 x research source claude monet s still life apples and grapes is a still life painting of a table with fruit 11 x research source translate a title into another language key words that reflect the topic or theme of your artwork might resonate better in another language choose a few words and try them in another language make sure you spell the words right in the other language double check any accents or other required markings for your words missing these markings can potentially mean altering the entire meaning of a given word try to find someone who speaks that language run your title by them to make sure it doesn t carry unwanted connotations see if there are other works of art with the same name the goal with titling your artwork is to make sure it stands apart from other works of art if it has the same name as another piece of artwork especially something well known that can unintentionally link your art to someone else s risking confusion misinterpretation or just basic lack of originality search online for your title and see what you find ask others for their impression of your title your title might mean one thing to you but something entirely different to another person getting first reactions and feedback on your title can be a good way to understand how it will be received consider if your title is ambiguous or if it can be interpreted in different ways check your spelling unless it s deliberate don t send your artwork out into the world with any misspelled word in the title your error can make you look less professional or serious as an artist similarly double check grammar especially if your title is longer than a phrase 12 x research source make the title work for you while you might title a piece of art to give it additional meaning you may also title a piece of art so that you can promote yourself as an artist forgo the untitled title and instead strive to have a distinguishable work of art this can potentially even add value to your artwork 13 x research source for paintings in a series you might name them sequentially such as blue fence 1 blue fence 2 and so on they may be hard to keep track of however go for different titles and help yourself keep track of individual works reviewers critics and collectors can reference your work more accurately with a specific title if you call all your pieces untitled it will quickly get confusing as to which piece is being referred to having a unique title will make it easier for people searching online for your work to find you 14 x research source make sure the title accompanies your artwork if you plan to circulate your artwork at all make sure the title of the piece goes with the artwork write it on the back of the actual piece of art 15 x research source if you post your artwork online make sure your title appears with the artwork this can improve your online profile by making your artwork easier to find,Arts-and-Entertainment

to practice don t be afraid to challenge yourself and try new things when you practice try things that you know that you can t do you can learn a lot more by grappling with things you don t know than by repeating things you re already good at don t worry about how good what you re doing is the only way to learn new things is to experiment 7 x research source try a master study a master study a type of practice wherein you take a great work of art and replicate it it probably won t be perfect but you will be learning from the best 8 x research source give yourself time to improve give yourself plenty of time to improve and test the direction your art is taking this means being patient and giving yourself time to stand back and obtain a bigger perspective of where you re headed most importantly keep at it personal style takes time to develop don t expect it to be innate it is like the sculptor chiseling away at the rock what you re capable of can take years to be revealed be strange vanderbilt psychologists have found that people who are a bit weird are more creative 9 x research source art that is unique generally sells better than art that simply shows a high level of skill having a distinctive style of living is often part of an artists trademark in other words bucking norms might help you become a more original artist and even if it doesn t it certainly makes for

people s work without realizing it a particularly impressive image can be engraved in your memory so that you unconsciously recreate it while searching for something new expose yourself to a lot of influences and when you create something ask yourself how if it too closely resembles the work of someone else be prepared to change your style over time keep things fresh and be prepared to pursue new paths as you grow as an artist even if you have developed a signature style you might find that it gets old with time experimentation does not necessarily mean giving up what you have done before just developing a wider repertoire consider the value of a career art isn t necessarily about money but it is a lot easier to devote the time to developing your craft when you don t have to work a full time job at the same time think of the money you earn from art as liberating you to pursue what you love a career can cascade as you earn the money to support yourself you can spend more time developing skill and a reputation as an artist 14 x research source advertise you should build a portfolio of your own work and then do everything you can so that other people find and purchase it

how to design a playbill,every level of theater performance from a play at a local elementary school to broadway productions comes with a playbill this pamphlet informs the audience about crucial elements of the play its title and show dates the names of the cast members and which character each plays and a brief synopsis of the scenes or musical numbers in each act you can produce a small 4 page playbill on a single full size sheet of paper or staple two sheets of paper together to create an 8 page playbill,choose the size of your playbill for most off broadway plays a simple playbill can be designed common sizes include a 4 page layout usually 4 pages of design fitted onto 1 piece of paper or an 8 page design two full sheets of paper each folded in half the choice is up to you depending on budgetary restrictions and the amount of information that you and the theater director want to convey in the playbill if you re designing this playbill for a professional level play you ll have significantly more resources at your disposal and can commission a professionally designed cover and a professionally printed layout the inner contents of the playbill however will be largely similar design the 4 page playbill if you select the 4 page option the playbill s front and back covers will be on the top left and right quarter of a sheet of paper these quarters will form the outside of the playbill the cast page and list of scenes will be on the bottom left and right of the sheet of paper these pages will form the inside of the playbill a 4 page playbill is usually the best option if you have a low budget design an 8 page playbill if you have a complex play with many performers and many acts scenes and even musical numbers that you d like to lay out for your audience an 8 page layout will suit you better 1 x research source for these you ll make a stapled pamphlet by placing folded sheets of paper inside one another if you have a bigger budget and have a lot of things to cover you can add more pages as you see fit design the front cover the front cover of the playbill must contain the title of your play and almost always features are large photograph or illustration that is thematically associated with the topic of the play 2 x research source use or create an image that correlates with the theme of the play for example if your play is about detectives consider using an image of a city a police officer a fedora or a newspaper so long as you stick to the theme you can create anything on the front cover talk to the director and see if they have an image or photograph that they d like to feature add title text on the front cover you can be creative with the font choice size and shape off the title feel free to take some creative license while it s typical to locate titles at the top of a playbill cover you could also arrange the letters vertically or place the title on a diagonal line if you like match the font itself to the content of the play for example if the playbill is for a production of julius caesar use a classical formal all caps font add other basic information at the bottom of the cover credit the play s director s writer s songwriter s and choreographer s lay out the inside cover if you re designing a 6 or 8 page playbill the inside cover is the page that you ll see on the left once you ve opened the pamphlet s cover if the director would like to type up a director s note to introduce the play that can be set on the inside cover alternately you can type up show times and dates on the inside cover 3 x research source if you opt for the latter option include a listing of all of the performances and their start times this shouldn t take up much space since small companies or high school or college theaters usually only run a play three or four times design the back cover the back cover can serve various purposes for plays that seek local financial sponsors the back cover is often devoted to displaying advertisements otherwise it can be used as an autographs page the autographs page is made so that audience members can get the cast to sign it for them and so should be left mostly blank you can simply put the word autographs across the top of the page and then leave room for various signatures remember do not actually put your own autograph on fill out the cast page the cast page is commonly the second page in a small playbill its purpose is to list the names of the players and the names of their characters names of the actors are typically listed on the left side of the page and character names are listed on the right side 4 x research source if you don t know this information yourself you ll need to find out ask the play s director or casting manager for the list of actor names and the names of the corresponding characters the top of the page can simply read cast or players beneath this it s common to include a line stating in order of appearance in order of speaking or in alphabetical order according to the director s preference the cast page can be complex if the director adds or removes extras or inevitable spelling errors crop up start working on this page early in the design process create a list of acts and scenes in order to help audience members follow along with the action of the play it s common to include a scene list in the playbill this page is typically structured like an outline list the numbers or names of scenes and within each scene specify the number and name of each individual act along with any musical numbers 5 x research source the list of acts and scenes and musical numbers may take up two pages if you re creating a playbill for a longer play or one with many acts list ensemble members within each song typically playbills will provide the audience with the names of all the characters who perform in a certain song or musical number under act 1 and scene 1 list all of the songs vertically on the right side of the page list the character names for example for a production of annie get your gun list annie oakley and frank butler across from a song in which only those two characters perform provide a brief plot summary for each act if the director requests include a very brief description of the plot within each act to help the audience follow the action the playbill could provide a more detailed plot summary if you re concerned that your audience members may become confused about which character is which for example if you re creating a playlist for the wizard of oz the scene in which dorothy arrives in oz could be summarized dorothy s house lands in oz and the munchkins convince her to visit the wizard to find her way home add a page crediting the crew if you have enough room in your 8 page playbill dedicate one page to thanking the crew who helped produce the play the technical crew includes people who handled sound lighting and other technical aspects and those who designed the set add a credits or thank you page if you re using an 8 page layout the last page can be dedicated to crediting financial sponsors among other individuals and the hosting venue among others typically the playbill will thank the actors choreographers the director and co director the playwrights the venue which has hosted the performances and the rehearsal space 6 x research source finally remember to thank the audience,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to mat artwork,matting is a great way to protect to your artwork while also showing it off you can choose mats in a variety of colors sizes and materials to create the perfect mat board frame for your pieces learning how to mat artwork on your own will take some time and practice it ll be worth it though as it ll save you from cringing over the high costs of taking your art to be matted at frame shops,choose a clean space for matting wipe the space down with a damp cloth and then completely dry it as you re going to be using your mat board to display your artwork you don t want it to get covered in dirt and grime you ll also be using your art to make proper measurements so it s extra important to have a clean work space 1 x research source don t use cleaning solutions or soap to clean your workspace as these could damage your materials measure your artwork and mat border for the total board size this is going to require some math so break out your calculator first you need to decide how wide you d like the mat border to be next measure the width and length of your artwork this will give you the size you need to cut out the window the cut out that will display the artwork add the window and border measurements for the total mat board size 2 x research source if you re not showing any border or edges on the side of the artwork you may want to subtract ¼ inch 0 64 cm from each side ½ inch or 1 27 cm total for both length and width this will give you a neat edge underneath your mat board your mat board should match up in size with your backing once you ve got the mat board measured use these measurements to size out the backing as well mark the outer edges of the mat and backing boards most boards come in standard sizes that will need to be trimmed to fit your artwork now that you ve got your measurements use a tape measure or ruler and make two light pencil marks in each corner to record them 3 x research source use the back of your frame for measurements if you re going to frame your matted art both your backing and the mat boards need to be measured to fit into the frame use the back of the frame to make sure you ve got these measurements right if your backing and mat boards are too big you may need to trim down the border size 4 x research source having a frame before you start matting limits your flexibility on sizing the mat board border so you may want to wait to pick a frame until after everything s already matted use a ruler and pencil to trace your measurements remove your artwork from the backing and mat boards and set it to the side use a ruler to make straight lines connecting each of the small marks you just made you should have two rectangles or squares on your mat board and one on your backing 5 x research source use a straight edge razor to cut the backing and mat boards press the razor down firmly at the top corners of the boards pull the razor slowly and steadily towards you stopping at the bottom corner keep the same pressure throughout your cut and be very careful not to dip out or in from the penciled line 6 x research source keeping the line straight is the toughest part of this whole process it s also frustrating because you ll have to start over if your lines aren t straight use something with a straight edge such as an old frame or a heavy book to help you cut cut twice so the mat pops out of the window you shouldn t need to use any force to remove the cut out as this could rip the mat board window make the cuts at least twice to allow the cut out to simply fall out of the window make sure you re cutting on the exact same lines each time 7 x research source you may need to make several cuts to remove the cut out do as many as you need to but take your time each repeated cut needs to be on the same line as all the others measure to center your artwork on the backing place your artwork on the backing and measure the space on each side you should have the same amount of blank space above and below the artwork as well as on the left and right sides of the piece make small pencil marks in the corners on the backing to record the right spot check your centering by laying down your window it s a good idea to make sure your centering looks right with the window on top of the artwork this will give you an idea of what your final matted piece is going to look like take a minute to enjoy it before you get back to work use a weight to keep your artwork in place now that everything s centered it s time to start attaching all the pieces to one another use something heavy like a sock filled with coins or a heavy glass to keep your artwork where you want it don t worry too much if it shifts though since you ve made marks to keep track of the centering tape the back of your art to the backing use linen or archival tape to create what s called a hinge to attach your window to the backing put two pieces of tape in vertical lines on each side of the back of the piece so the sticky side doesn t touch the backing lay two more pieces of tape horizontally across the vertical pieces sticky side down to adhere the artwork to the backing linen and archival tape has the adhesive ability of regular tape but it won t damage your artwork or mat board it ll cost more than normal tape but regular household tape contains acids and other chemicals that may eventually leak onto your artwork use photo corners or mounting strips to attach your artwork if you re using corners take off the bottom adhesive and place four of them on the backing at each corner of the piece for see through mounting strips use two on each side of the piece or eight total and adhere them to the backing you can then slip the artwork directly under the corners or strips photo corners and strips are best for conservation as they avoid the damage that even linen tape could cause to your piece attach the window mat by creating a taped hinge lay down the window and the backing flush against each other with the window face down use one long strip of linen tape to connect the window to the backing place the tape so one half is on the back of the window and one half is on the backing fold them together like you re closing a book it s best to connect the window and backing at the top of the frame you re now ready to put this matted print into a frame if you d like a more finished look you can also attach an adhesive picture hanger to the back of your backing board to hang the matted frame up on the wall by itself purchase equipment if you plan to dry mount dry mounting rather than using tape is a more involved process if you want a permanent and extremely stable mount and you don t mind opening your wallet go for it you ll need a tacking iron dry mounting and release tissues and a professional heating press 8 x research source investing in dry mounting equipment may be a great idea if you know you want to consistently mount lots of artwork or photographs this really will be an investment dry mount presses cost a few thousand dollars and tacking irons may cost between 50 100 the tissues will be less pricey be aware that dry mounting isn t recommended for older artwork or pieces you d like to preserve it s a permanent irreversible process so it s not the best option for conservation measure your artwork and window to size the backing board it s time for math pick the size you d like for the border of your window measure your artwork add these two numbers together to calculate how large the backing needs to be make two pencil marks in the corners to record your measurements 9 x research source place artwork face down to lay dry mounting tissue behind it make sure you ve got a clean space for this step once you ve put down your artwork lay a sheet of dry mounting tissue over it it should cover the artwork completely you ll trim off the excess later 10 x research source attach the center of the print to the tissue with a heated tacking iron most tacking irons can be plugged in to heat them up just like normal irons once you ve let your iron get toasty place it in the center of the face down artwork and dry mounting tissue iron the tissue for a few seconds in a small circle to adhere it to the back of the piece trim off the excess dry mounting tissue use scissors or a paper trimmer to carefully cut off the extra dry mounting tissue go slowly you need neat straight lines and you don t want to cut your artwork by accident 11 x research source if you have access to a large paper trimmer this will make cutting the tissue much easier and neater measure to center your artwork on its backing place the artwork face up on its backing use a tape measure to check its placement you should have the same amount of extra space on the left and right sides as well as on the top and bottom of the piece make pencil marks on the backing to mark the spot 12 x research source use the tacking iron to attach two corners to the backing gently lift up two corners of the piece one at a time take your heated tacking iron and adhere the dry mounting tissue which should be laying flat on the backing to the backing pull the tacking iron from the center outwards adhere two opposite corners 13 x research source press your print in a heated press for about 1 2 minutes lift up the press cover and slip your piece inside two pieces of leftover mat board and release paper close the press it should be heated to about 180 82 22 use a stopwatch to keep track of the time 14 x research source for photographs resin based paper should only be heated for about 60 90 seconds while fiber based papers should be heated for 2 4 minutes fiber based paper is the material that s more commonly used to print high quality pictures 15 x research source weigh down the mounted print while it cools you don t want the board to warp or bubble during the cooling process once you remove it from the press keep it flat by laying it face down underneath something heavy the artwork needs to be fully cooled before you remove it from under the weight test it by lifting one corner and gently touching your finger to the backing 16 x research source use a large coffee table book or several socks with coins in them if you don t have a flattening weight specially made for the dry mounting process make sure your workspace is still clean before you lay your artwork face down to cool choose archival backing and mat boards for original artwork archival materials are designed to preserve artwork by using acid free paper that won t damage your pieces this is the stuff that museums use on their collections so you know it s high quality these materials will cost you a little more however if you re matting expensive prints or original artwork this is the way to go 17 x research source choose standard backing and mats boards for less valuable art if you re matting a print that s less expensive you may not be as concerned with damage be aware that while it may take years for standard backing and mat boards to affect your prints it will happen eventually if you re matting something that you care about even if it s not pricey pick the archival quality materials 18 x research source use a wide mat border for smaller pieces to highlight smaller artwork or photographs set them in wide bordered mats this will make the piece look more dramatic it ll also draw observers attention to the center of the piece 19 x research source measuring the border will depend on the size of the piece your border should measure as wide as at least 25 of the shortest edge so if your piece is 8 in by 12 in 20 32 cm by 30 48 cm you ll need a minimum of 2 inches 5 08 cm for the border go up an inch or two 2 54 5 08 cm to make this a wider border 20 x research source use a narrow mat border for large impressive pieces larger artwork generally speaks for itself it doesn t need any added flair it s especially important to keep elaborate or detailed large pieces in windows with thin borders 21 x research source keep your border at the minimum measurement 25 of the shortest edge for a narrow width choose white matting to limit distractions from the art don t think of white as boring as white will allow your pieces to shine all on their own white matting also provides a clean look white is perfect for original artwork as it ll allow observers to focus only on the art itself 22 x research source choose neutrals for a soft but subtle mat if you d like to add a little more character to your matting without distracting from the artwork try other neutrals grays beiges and off whites can all be great choices this can allow you to add diversity to your mat boards without overshadowing your pieces 23 x research source choose colors that don t compete with the artwork if you do decide to go with other colors choose carefully you need colors that complement the artwork rather than competing with it try choosing a color that s already present in the piece to draw it out a bit 24 x research source if you have a piece that s mostly orange for example don t go with a blue mat board avoid mats that are darker or brighter than the artwork if you really want to add color put bright or bold colors on the bottom thinner layer of a double mat 25 x research source put photographs in 3 inch 7 62 cm white mats for a crisp look photographs look especially good in matted frames and they can give you something beautiful to display on your walls try a relatively large border in white to give your photographs a professional appearance 26 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to get started as an artist,artists may use many mediums to express themselves and with practice perseverance and talent art can be anything from a passionate hobby to a lucrative career,practice with various mediums art is created with an almost limitless variety of mediums from oil paints to clay from stone to electricity here are a few popular media used by artists pencils and paper drawing is a fundamental art form probably first practiced with a piece of charcoal or some colored clay on a cave wall it is now a refined technique using a variety of paper and pencils pen and ink pen and ink is another form of drawing using heavy rag paper or scratch board and usually a nib pen and ink it can be used to create dramatic contrasts and exquisite detail pastels pastel sticks are pigment mixed with very little binder and rolled to form sticks that resemble colored chalks only the cheapest student grade ones are dyed chalk they can be used for drawing or painting on pastel paper heavy sketch paper watercolor paper or sanded pastel papers oil pastels these sticks resemble crayons and range from very inexpensive children s oil pastels to artist grade oil pastels made with expensive pigments much more opaque than crayons they work on paper boards wood canvas metal or almost any surface watercolors oils and acrylic paints these are vastly different media grouped together only because they are familiar to most people and are all used in what we know as painting ceramics this media is clay which can be hand shaped formed in a mold thrown on a potter s wheel or sculpted by other means sculpting with stone this is a challenging and physically demanding technique modern technology has created tools for removing stone to form a shape but traditionally it is done with a hammer and chisels photography a technique which is constantly in a state of change with new technologies emerging continuously from digital cameras and editing to special effects filters and lighting carving usually done with chisels and knives this is a traditional art form that has also benefited from technology with the emergence of die grinding tools for shaping saws and shapers to duplicate images and remove large amounts of wood quickly and glues and resins for refitting or laminating the work piece as it is worked there are many other media and simply too many techniques to cover them all in one article experiment with the above techniques and materials or others to see which is more enjoyable and productive to you as an individual look at classes offered in your area or even online many school districts offer art classes for students from elementary school through high school often these are elective courses beyond elementary school level and if you are interested in art try to work your school schedule to take all the art classes possible community colleges and universities sometime offer adult education classes in many art techniques check for studio classes or private art teachers if no classes are available where you live in former times almost all artists began as apprentices to masters those who had completed their own apprenticeships and were tradesmen in their craft now some artists will offer apprenticeships to talented individuals who learn from their teacher as they do other studio work as payment practice your medium keep a record or a portfolio of your work whether it is in a sketchbook an album or with photographs of sculptures or carvings this will enable you to see improvements and establish a personal technique work with your talents and skills when you have opportunity if you have talent and develop skill as a painter or in drawing you may get a chance to do some commission work making posters or signs for neighborhood businesses or events watch for contests or art shows which feature the medium you work in shopping malls community organizations and other groups often sponsor juried showings of work and invite members of the community to display and sometimes sell their work this will be an opportunity to share ideas with other artists and to see public reaction to your own work don t be disappointed when every project is not a success this is especially true of sculpture or ceramic projects which may literally fall apart in during the creative process look for inspiration everywhere you go be very observing and pay attention to the whole world around you from the trees in your local park to how their golden leaves glow in the natural light the world is full of shapes textures images colors and forms and many of what are regarded as masterpieces were created using a simple not beautiful subject and the talent of a dedicated artist,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to do mixed media art,one of the best things about mixed media art is that the possibilities are endless in terms of materials you can use you can create a collage by forming a background and adding as many layers as you want combine pencil and watercolor to create a unique image or add embellishments to photographs using a variety of materials the sky is the limit when it comes to mixed media use your imagination and have fun with whatever you do,choose a base material your mixed media base can be any flat surface many people use either blank canvases or pieces of flat wood you could also use a journal or notebook to make a personalized jacket for your journal 1 x research source your base material can be any size or shape that you want just be sure it has a flat surface collect thin paper with text or images to use in your background you have many options here for what to use old paper from your printer with text on it sheet music pages from the phone book newspaper pages thin magazine pages children s book pages and patterned tissue paper are just a few 2 x research source start a collection by going through old books and newspapers and pulling out pages you may want to use in the future if you have a space for working on art create a space for your paper collection and organize it according to type add color and texture to your paper with watered down paint select pages of thin paper you d like to use and some inexpensive acrylic paint of any color water down your paint by squeezing about 2 tablespoons 30 ml of paint into a cup adding that same amount in water and mixing it begin painting your pages of paper with thick stripes circles squares or any pattern of shapes that you d like 3 x research source allow your first layer and each subsequent layer to dry for 15 minutes before adding another layer with a different paint color and different shapes continue adding colors and shapes until you get a look that you like if your paint is too thick and seems to be covering the text or images from your paper thin it down more by adding more water to it you want to be able to see the text and images from the paper through the paint make your background with thick pages and degreaser for an abstract look instead of using thin pages and painting them take some thick glossy magazine pages such as national geographic that have images on them take a citrus based household degreaser and spray the pages until the colors start to run and blend together 4 x research source the more degreaser you spray on the pages the more the colors will run and the more abstract the image will appear if you want to keep a bit of the image coherent just spray the page once or twice and allow that to dry before spraying any more cover your work area with a drop cloth to avoid getting degreaser on any surfaces you don t want sprayed allow your pages to dry for 15 20 minutes adhere your background papers to your canvas with decoupage plan out how you want your background to look and start cutting or ripping pieces of background paper squeeze some decoupage into a cup and using a small craft paintbrush brush some decoupage onto your canvas lay down a piece of background paper onto the decoupage then brush the top of the paper with decoupage 5 x research source cover the edges of the paper with a coating of decoupage to seal them to the canvas you can fill your entire canvas with pieces of background paper and overlap them at certain points or leave empty spaces on your canvas to fill in later with paint or other materials allow your canvas to dry overnight when you have finished applying your background pieces and you like how it looks fill in empty spaces with acrylic or gesso paint if you left any spaces of canvas open between your background pages or you d like to cover some of them up you can do so with any color paint acrylic paint will leave you with a slick shiny appearance while gesso or acrylic mixed with gesso will dry matte and have more texture and thickness to it 6 x research source try covering some of your background in strips of ripped masking tape then applying a layer of paint with a brush your original background will peek through when you rip off the tape create a pattern with rubber stamps choose a rubber stamp such as a flower or the eifel tower and stamp the image across your canvas either in a couple of rows across the whole canvas or in 1 corner the repetitive design up against your background will create another visually pleasing layer 7 x research source use dark ink on light background areas or white ink on dark background areas to make the stamps stand out hold a heat gun near a heavily painted area to create bubbles a way to add some texture to your collage is to paint an area of it heavily with acrylic paint allow the area of thick paint to dry overnight then hold a heat gun up to the surface very close but not quite touching it lift the gun away immediately and place it back down in a different spot to add more bubbles 8 x research source the heat from the gun will add bumps and bubbles to the paint you can allow bubbles to break open for a unique look work quickly to make sure you don t apply too much heat and ruin the base of your collage to achieve this effect on your entire collage you would need to use clay board as your base instead of canvas or wood holding the heat gun up to thinner painted areas on canvas or wood could damage your entire collage add different texture with hot glue and gesso another way to add texture is by drawing shapes onto your collage with hot glue simply heat up a glue gun and draw spirals tree branches or any shapes you want onto your collage allow the glue to dry for half an hour then paint over it and the area surrounding it with any color gesso paint 9 x research source try wiping the gesso with a paper towel before it s dry to create a smeared textured look that allows your background papers to show through allow every layer to dry before adding a new one on top of it attach ribbon beads or metalwork to your canvas with hot glue use any collection of old jewelry or trim to add a top layer to your collage you ll want to make sure you re done with your painting layers before starting this step so that you don t cover your items in paint unless you want your items painted 10 x research source try choosing an image from your background or a shape that has come out as a focal point and attach beads around that as a border use an antique brooch or other piece of metal jewelry to create your collage s focal point experiment with dried flowers to attach to your collage these work best when they are already flattened during the drying process cover your finished collage with decoupage to make it shine to finalize your collage and make sure all your layers are secure brush a thin layer of decoupage over the finished design allow this layer to dry for a few hours and you re ready to display your piece 11 x research source print a black and white photo you d like to draw on regular printer paper print a black and white photo of a person animal building you like or landscape on regular printer paper any image that you like will work you will use this photo as a reference to recreate it as a pencil and watercolor piece 12 x research source you don t need to use an originally black and white image just make sure the printed out version is in black and white instead of printing from a computer use an image in a photography book and make a black and white photocopy of it photocopiers can be found at many libraries and office supply stores if you re experienced in drawing and want to use your own personal drawing you can skip this step and make your drawing in graphite on a piece of watercolor paper then skip down to the step about filling in your drawing with colored pencil flip the paper over and cover the image with graphite scribbles on the back of the printed photo cover the paper in graphite using a soft 6b or 8b graphite pencil you want to get a nice layer of graphite all over the parts of the image that you ll be using in your drawing start with a sharpened pencil while scribbling and allow the point to get dull 13 x research source sharpen your pencil again if it becomes so dull you can no longer use it turn the paper back over and clip it to your watercolor paper when you ve covered the back of the print out in graphite flip the paper over and clip it front side up to a similarly sized piece of watercolor paper be sure that the image is securely in place so that it doesn t slide around when you re tracing it 14 x research source use multiple clips or tape on every side to make sure the image is secured to the watercolor paper and won t move around use a ballpoint pen to trace your image on your image print out trace major lines and smaller details directly onto the image with ballpoint pen do not color anything in simply trace the details the pressure from the pen will transfer graphite lines onto your piece of watercolor paper behind the image 15 x research source you can make a few extra lines to denote important shadows from your image but the actual shadowing will come later remove the image print out from the watercolor paper when you have finished fully tracing the image in detail remove the print out from the watercolor paper you should have a good traced sketch of the image on your watercolor paper now 16 x research source if there are any parts missing or ones that are too light add more graphite scribbles to the back of your print out and trace it onto the watercolor paper again fill in the image with colored pencil starting with the darkest parts using your print out for reference shade the darkest parts of the image on your watercolor paper with black or sepia colored pencil coloring the darkest parts first will help you transform the outline of the image into a version that looks more and more like the actual image 17 x research source next shade the lighter parts of the image using a warm grey colored pencil mix some watercolors with water choose colors that you would like to use on your piece if the original image was in color you can use these colors as a reference point or make your piece have totally different colors it s entirely up to you mix your paints with plenty of water so that the colors are nice and light 18 x research source apply watercolor to various parts of your pencil drawing however you like using your light watered down colors and a small paintbrush begin adding color to details of your drawing some people like to keep the color in their pieces at a minimum while others like their image to be more drenched in color allow your colors to dry for half an hour before moving on to the next step 19 x research source after you ve painted parts of your image in the very watered down colors you can add more bright highlights with less watered down colors according to your preference use black watercolor to highlight details and shadows to go over some of the darkest areas of your piece dip a clean paintbrush into water and add just 1 drop of water to some black watercolor this will give you the densest black to add to the dark areas of your image when you ve filled in the darkest areas lighten the black watercolor to grey by adding more water 20 x research source use the greyish watercolor to fill in lighter shadows on your image allow your watercolors to dry for half an hour add texture with colored pencil to finalize the piece let your watercolors dry for at least a half an hour when the paint is dry use your colored pencils to add more texture to your piece if your image is an animal pencils are especially useful in creating fur 21 x research source use your pencils to add subtle details to your piece such as blades of grass lines on leaves texture of brick or stone on a building or hair on people if you think your piece doesn t have enough watercolor you can always go back and add more just finalize the piece with pencils as your last step choose some photographs to alter many people like using old photos for this project but you can use any photo you want look for old photos at thrift stores antique stores or garage sales or choose photos from your own collection 22 x research source if you re using a photo that s important to you and you re afraid of messing up make a paper photocopy of the photo to try out your ideas before permanently changing the photograph try watercolor on a black and white photo to make it pop mix some watercolors with a small amount of water so that they re nice and bright apply color carefully to the lighter or white parts of a black and white photo in any way that you want 23 x research source don t be afraid to make the colors weird if that s what you want to do make people have green skin make the sky red etc add shapes designs or text in ink on a photo to create a brand new image use colored or black ink to modify your photo by adding shapes designs or words black ink drawings look nice over colored photos while colored ink looks great on black and white sepia or monochrome photos 24 x research source try giving people word bubbles like in comics or add stars over their eyes or add to the background of a photo with lots of different shapes and designs change the colors and details of a photograph with paint pens pastels or acrylics take any colored photograph and change the colors by outlining a part of it in a different color of paint pen pastel or acrylic paint or use black and white photos to add color 25 x research source add shapes and designs in any way that you like with your paint paint pen or pastel to change the original photo as much as you like add glitter newspaper clippings or pressed flowers to make your photos 3d similar to collage you can glue a variety of objects on top of any photograph to add embellishments you can do this in conjunction with changing the photos with painting or drawing or do this on its own remember your only limit is your own imagination 26 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to prepare isinglass,isinglass is a gelatin based glue used as an adhesive in art conservation for preserving parchment or as a clarifying agent in alcoholic drinks although you can purchase prepared isinglass you can also make it yourself as long as you have 3 days dried fish swim bladders and a double boiler you ll be able to make your own isinglass,purchase dried and unclotted sturgeon swim bladders you can purchase sturgeon bladders online or from some artist supply stores before using the bladders inspect them to make sure they re free of blood clots and other large blemishes 1 x research source hake cod or other fish with swim bladders can work as an alternative sturgeon bladders are however most commonly used 2 x research source put the swim bladders in a container filled with room temperature water the amount of water should be in an approximate 1 10 swim bladder to water ratio place the container somewhere that it can sit undisturbed while the water softens the swim bladders a glass container is ideal so you can keep an eye on the swim bladders while they soak pour the water and swim bladders into a container with ml markings on the side this will help you pour the water more accurately soak the swim bladders for 24 hours let the swim bladders soak for approximately 1 day after 24 hours the swim bladders should be easily pulled apart and spongy to the touch 3 x research source cutting the swim bladders into smaller pieces can help the isinglass soak up water knead the swim bladders into a thick paste using your hands work the swim bladders into a paste continue kneading until the paste is a consistent doughy texture and contains no larger chunks 4 x research source leave the swim bladders in the container while you knead them if you have smaller flakes in the paste that you can t work out with your hands don t worry these inconsistencies will be filtered out after boiling set up a double boiler fill the bottom part halfway with water then set it on a stovetop burner place the top part of the double boiler onto the bottom part 5 x research source if you don t have a double boiler you can make one as an alternative to make your own double boiler fill a pot with water and put it over your stovetop place a thick wooden block in the water set a glass beaker on top of the wooden block to keep it afloat while you boil the swim bladder paste fill the glass beaker or double boiler with the swim bladder paste and water this water should be the same water you used to fill the container while the swim bladders soaked do not add more water as too much can dilute the paste let the swim bladder paste simmer at 140 f 60 c turn on the stovetop to begin heating the paste keep the temperature consistent as overheating the paste can damage its consistency use a thermometer to monitor the water temperature checking it every few minutes as needed 6 x research source keep a glass of cold water on hand to cool the water in the bottom part of the double boiler if necessary 7 x research source stir the swim bladder paste for 45 minutes use your thermometer or a spoon to stir the paste for about 45 minutes continue stirring until the paste completely dissolves and turns the water a milky white color 8 x research source you should stir the swim bladder paste consistently for the entire 45 minutes filter the isinglass glue through a nylon stocking place a nylon stocking over the top of a glass container and pour the isinglass glue into it the stocking should catch any residual inconsistencies and help make the glue smooth 9 x research source if you do not have a nylon stocking you can use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter as an alternative pour the glue onto a non stick mylar sheet place the mylar sheet on a flat surface where it can stay for 1 2 days undisturbed spread the glue over the mylar sheet with a spoon or spatula to prevent areas of pooling that will take longer to dry 10 x research source as an alternative you can also pour the isinglass glue in small even dots this will remove the need to cut the sheet later on 11 x research source although a mylar sheet is traditional you can also spread the isinglass over a polyester plastic sheet as an alternative let the isinglass dry for 12 24 hours depending on the room s temperature drying the isinglass should take between 12 24 hours leave the isinglass undisturbed while it dries to prevent damaging or contaminating it 12 x research source set up a plastic cover over the isinglass to keep it away from dust and impurities cut the dried isinglass into pieces isinglass is easier to store if you cut it in pieces instead of a large sheet the isinglass pieces should be a size small enough for all of them to fit in your storage container 13 x research source store the isinglass in an airtight container isinglass will keep best if tightly sealed in a cool dry atmosphere like a pantry or cupboard leave the isinglass in storage until you re ready to use it if stored correctly isinglass can keep for up to several years 14 x research source isinglass is traditionally used for clarifying alcoholic drinks restoring art and conserving parchment,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to photograph artwork for a website,to take photographs for your website use a camera with manual settings so you can capture rich detail take your pictures on cloudy days outdoors or with

options on your computer to choose your best ones you can easily take great shots for your website,use a camera with a removable lens and manual settings if possible while you don t need the most professional camera to shoot quality images you want to control the lighting and white balance dslr cameras with removable lenses are great to use because they capture your images in high quality and you can adjust the settings as you need to 1 x research source while you can take decent images with point and shoot cameras and smartphones they do not capture your images in high quality and resolution if this is all you have make sure you take your photos outside to capture as much detail as possible take your photographs on overcast days if shooting photos outdoors it is best to take pictures of your artwork outside on cloudy days because it reduces glare on your lens and helps capture your artwork in as much detail as possible choose days where most or all of the sun is blocked out by clouds 2 x research source harsh direct lighting can create reflections cast shadows and change the colors to take the most advantage of daylight shoot around 2 00pm 3 x research source shoot near a large window if taking your pictures inside using the natural light from a window is best for shooting indoors because you can utilize bright and soft lighting open up your blinds and set up your photo shoot next to your window 4 x research source if possible shoot on partly cloudy days on days with maximum sunlight you can still get varying brightness levels even if shooting indoors use a clean white background to take the most detailed shots you want to match your camera s white balance to a white background a simple color helps keep your camera s focus on the artwork rather than the background 5 x research source you can use a white piece of fabric white poster board or large white piece of paper for example place your artwork on a flat level surface to take your photos you can sit your artwork on the floor propping it against the wall or you can place hang your artwork from a hook on a clean white wall if you have paper artwork it is helpful to put it a frame so you can either prop it or hang it up 6 x research source use a tripod to keep your camera from moving tripods keep your camera stationary when shooting which is necessary to take the most detailed and clear images to connect your tripod to your camera look for the screw at the top of your tripod insert it into the base of your camera and tighten it into place 7 x research source alternatively you can use a monopod they are helpful tools to keep your camera from moving though they aren t quite as secure as tripods if you don t have a tripod or monopod use any flat level surface to keep your camera straight adjust your camera s angle so your artwork is in the center of the shot move your camera up or down to match the angle of your artwork so they are parallel you can adjust your camera by using the hand lever on your tripod or by gently lifting the base of the tripod up or down you may need to move your camera closer or further from your art to keep it centered 8 x research source on average your camera should be about 4 5 ft 1 2 1 5 m from your art if your artwork is hanging from a hook you want your camera to be straight with your piece if your artwork needs to be at a slant tilt your camera slightly turn off the lights in your room if shooting indoors flip the switch on the lights in your room to minimize additional lighting the light from your window will be plenty 9 x research source overhead lights have their own color and they often don t mix well with the light from your window set your iso to 100 or 200 to get the best quality images your iso controls your image sensitivity and the exact iso to use will depend on your particular camera go with 100 if your camera has it and use 200 as a backup option if not find the iso setting and select 100 10 x research source if you need assistance with changing your iso check your user s manual turn off your flash to avoid glares and bright spots go to your camera s flash settings and select off if you are shooting indoors and use a flash the extra light may overpower your image 11 x research source you do not need to use bright lights when photographing your artwork use the automatic white balance setting and adjust if you need to look at the white background of your image does it look like it has an orange or blue tint if so adjust your white balance you can use a preset for your lighting environment such as shade or daylight 12 x research source set your aperture to f8 if using a tripod look for the dial on the top of your camera and locate the m position adjust your camera to manual mode by selecting this then press to plus or minus button below your camera s shutter to change the aperture stop when you reach f8 13 x research source you can capture great detail and depth by using an f8 aperture keep your camera in manual mode if you do not have a tripod f8 works well when your camera is perfectly stationary position your camera horizontally or vertically to match your artwork if you are shooting horizontal pieces such as landscapes keep your camera in the horizontal position if shooting vertical artwork like portraits adjust your camera on your tripod so the camera is in the vertical position 14 x research source to move your camera pull up on the adjustment bar where your camera meets the tripod then lift up on your camera to pull it from horizontal to vertical leave no more than 1 3 in 2 5 7 6 cm around your artwork to maximize resolution when your camera is set up and ready to shoot check the viewfinder and see how much room is around your art if you have more than a few inches around your artwork you can zoom in on your image or move your tripod back a bit 15 x research source this is helpful because your camera will focus on your art without any distractions providing you with the most clear resolution fill the camera with your artwork as much as you can shoot with a self timer to keep your camera perfectly still go into your camera settings and locate the timer option select 3 or 5 seconds based on your preference then press down on your shutter release button to take your picture 16 x research source this is helpful because it minimizes any potential movements so your image will look as clear and detailed as possible use exposure compensation if your shots are too bright or too dark if your image is overexposed or hard to see you can adjust your settings and take additional pictures select your camera settings for aperture or shutter priority then choose the setting that reads exposure compensation 17 x research source this helps adjust the levels of light in your photo so the dark and light tones are balanced take 3 10 shots of each piece to ensure you have quality photos the more shots you take the more chances you have of capturing the perfect picture then you can review your images on your computer to pick the best 1 for your website great photos are rich in detail and in focus 18 x research source review your photographs on your computer before you pack up upload your images to your computer using a memory card reader and take a look at your shots notice the differences between light and look for any

how to use zero paints,zero paints is a brand of solvent based paints used for airbrushing model cars and vehicles they re primarily known for color matching paints used on life size vehicles so you can make your model look realistic zero paints makes paints to apply to a variety of materials including plastic resin and metal not only will this guide explain how to properly use zero paints but you ll learn how to properly prep and prime your model as well with a bit of work and patience you ll be able to paint model vehicles that look brand new,do not thin out zero paints before using them unlike other airbrush paints zero paints come pre thinned and are ready to load right out of the bottle this makes them much more convenient to use than other paints since you don t have to worry about them being too thick or clogging your airbrush 1 x research source zero paints work best with airbrushes with nozzles that are 0 3 mm or larger if you have a smaller airbrush you may need to mix additional thinner into the paint apply base coats of primer every time you use zero paints since zero paints are solvent based they may not adhere well to plastic or resin casting used for model vehicles putting layers of primer on your model first will help the paint stick easier and give your final paint job a more consistent color 2 x research source zero paints also sells primer to use in your airbrush but you can use any brand if you need to plan on using a clear coat when you re finished painting zero paints dry with a matte finish so your model vehicle won t look shiny or new like its full sized counterpart you can buy a pre mixed clear coat from zero paints or buy 2 part mixes that have a longer shelf life whenever you finish painting apply some clear coat to protect the finish 3 x research source you can also use automotive lacquer on your model vehicle sand down plastic mould lines with a 320 grit sanding block models come attached to other pieces of plastic and can leave raised mould lines that aren t supposed to be on the vehicle hold your sanding block against the line and apply light pressure work in a circular motion only sanding along the mould lines until they re flush with the rest of the body don t sand the entire surface with this sandpaper since you ll leave deeper scratches continue sanding around the remaining mould lines until you can t see them any more 4 x research source a sanding block will give you the most leverage but you can also use sandpaper if that s all you can get wash the model with warm soapy water the model may have dust wax and other contaminants on it so rinse it under running water put a few drops of mild liquid dish soap on the model and work it to a lather over the entire surface once you coat the entire model with suds rinse it off with warm running water 5 x research source if you have trouble working the soap into small and detailed areas use a toothbrush to lightly scrub the surface rough up the entire model s surface with 600 grit sandpaper while the model is still wet rub the model with your piece of sandpaper in circular motions using light pressure this sandpaper has a finer grit so it will leave small scratches that primer can stick to without visibly damaging the body focus on areas where you first sanded down the mould lines so you can remove any coarse scratch marks 6 x research source avoid using sandpaper with a lower grit since it will leave deeper pitting and scratch marks that will be visible through the paint rinse the model under warm water turn your faucet on and run your model underneath the stream the water will rinse off any residue you just sanded so it doesn t affect your paint job later on 7 x research source let the model air dry completely limit handling the model too much so you don t get your natural skin oils on the surface keep the model in a well ventilated room to help speed up the drying process depending on the temperature in your room it may take a few hours for the model to dry before you can start painting it check the model periodically to see if it still feels damp and leave it to dry for longer if it does 8 x research source try wrapping the model in a paper towel for an hour before setting it out to dry to help absorb some of the water set the model on a paint stand in a well ventilated area a model paint stand has wires or metal prongs that support the model off your work surface so your paint doesn t smudge set the piece you re painting on top of the stand s supports work in a room that has good ventilation or where you can open windows to help prevent harmful fumes from building up 9 x research source you can buy a model paint stand online or at a hobby store fumes from zero paints can irritate your eyes and nose if you aren t able to work in a well ventilated area wear safety goggles and a respirator to prevent irritation if you don t have a paint stand drive 4 nails that are 3 inches 7 6 cm long in a square pattern on a scrap piece of wood leave 2 inches 5 1 cm of the nails exposed so you can set the model on top of them connect an air compressor to an airbrush stylus airbrushes use pressurized air to spray light coats of paint onto a surface opt for an airbrush with a nozzle that s 0 3 mm or larger for the best results 10 x research source set the air compressor next to your work area and find the outlet nozzle push the end of the provided air hose tightly onto the compressor s nozzle then locate the cylindrical intake nozzle on the bottom or back end of the airbrush s stylus and push the other end of the hose onto it 11 x research source you can buy airbrushes online or at a hobby store many come in kits that already include an air compressor and hose so you don t need to buy them separately shake your primer for 2 minutes to mix it get a solvent based primer from zero paints so you don t have to worry about thinning it out keep the bottle sealed and vigorously shake it for at least 2 minutes once the primer has a consistent color inside of the bottle you can stop shaking it 12 x research source avoid using the primer without shaking it or else it will be separated and won t have a consistent color you need to use a primer whenever you use zero paints or else the paints could eat through the model s resin or plastic 13 x research source zero paints sells primer in white grey black red and pink if you re painting the model a light color opt for white or grey for very dark hues start with a black primer if you want the model to have a vibrant red finish choose the red or pink primer fill the airbrush s reservoir halfway with the primer look for a cylindrical reservoir on the bottom or top of the airbrush stylus unscrew the reservoir s cap and slowly pour the primer inside only fill the reservoir about half full before replacing the cap 14 x research source typically a 2 fl oz 59 ml bottle of primer will cover 2 3 models that are 1 24 scale avoid filling the reservoir to the top since airbrushes don t use a lot of paint during application set the air compressor between 15 40 psi start the air compressor and find the pressure control buttons or dial turn the dial or press the buttons to put the pressure setting within the range avoid setting the pressure any higher since you ll waste paint and won t get an even finish on the model 15 x research source the air pressure controls how much paint you apply with your airbrush higher settings will produce the most overspray while lower settings create more droplets and leave a rougher texture check the manual for your brand of airbrush and compressor to see if they recommend any specific settings press the button down on the stylus to spray your first coat hold the airbrush in your dominant hand like a pencil so your index finger rests on top of the button position the stylus nozzle 2 3 inches 5 1 7 6 cm away from the model to prevent overspray when you re ready to start priming push the button down to spray your primer spray the primer in short back and forth bursts keeping the stylus moving at all times so you don t apply the primer too thick start along the bottom edges of the model first and work up toward the top until you ve coated the entire piece 16 x research source some airbrushes require you to pull the button backward to apply paint if you don t see the primer coming out when you hold the button try pulling the button backward your airbrush will spray more primer the further you pull back the button test your airbrush on a piece of scrap paper first to make sure it sprays evenly wear a rubber disposable glove on your non dominant hand so you can hold and turn the model while you re spraying let the primer dry for 5 minutes after you finish the first coat leave it alone for at least 5 minutes so the primer has time to dry touch the surface lightly to check if it feels tacky and if it does let it dry for another 2 3 minutes 17 x research source avoid applying more primer while the first coat is still wet or else it may have an uneven finish or take longer to set later on apply 2 3 additional coats of primer alternate which directions you spray the primer in between each coat so you get even coverage for example if you used horizontal strokes on the first coat use vertical strokes on the second allow the primer to dry for 5 minutes between each coat so it has a smooth even finish 18 x research source on your final coat of primer use a criss cross pattern when you re spraying to cover any areas you may have missed always clean your airbrush stylus whenever you re finished using it if you have leftover primer in the reservoir you can pour it back into the bottle leave the model to dry for 24 hours after the final coat keep the model in a well ventilated area so the primer has time to dry and cure completely after 1 day you ll be able to handle your model without the primer lifting or smudging 19 x research source drying times depend on the climate in your area paints will take longer to dry in humid conditions so test if the primer feels dry in an inconspicuous spot smooth the primer with wet 1 200 grit sandpaper wet the sandpaper to prevent the dust from getting airborne apply light pressure as you work in circular motions over the surface of the model with the sandpaper focus on any areas where the primer looks raised or rough carefully sand the entire model until the primer feels smooth to the touch 20 x research source avoid using sandpaper with a lower grit since it will leave visible scratch marks that will show through the paint rinse the model with warm water to get rid of any residue turn your faucet to the warmest setting you can handle and run the primed model underneath the stream lightly rub the surface by hand or with a soft washcloth to remove any dust or residue leftover from the primer so it doesn t affect the rest of your paint job shake off any excess water before setting the model on a paper towel to dry completely 21 x research source since zero paints are solvent based they won t wash off with water choose a color that matches the model you re painting zero paints specializes in matching colors from vehicle dealerships so search their website for the specific make and model of the one you re painting pick the color you want to use and order a bottle if you re unable to find the make and model online you can still paint your model vehicle with any of the other colors listed on their site look for the color matched zero paints here https www zero paints com colour_matched_paints category 157 html you may be able to find zero paints in art and hobby stores a 2 fl oz 59 ml bottle of paint will usually be enough to cover 2 3 model vehicles that are 1 24 size shake the paint for 1 2 minutes the paint color and solvent can separate when it s left in the bottle so you have to mix it first keep the paint container closed and shake it well by hand after 1 2 minutes check the bottle to see if it has an even consistency 22 x research source avoid using unmixed paints in your airbrush since you ll have an inconsistent application and the stylus is more likely to clog load the paint color into the airbrush s reservoir unscrew your airbrush s reservoir cap and slowly pour your paint inside airbrushes don t require a lot of paint to get even coverage so only fill the reservoir halfway secure the cap back on the reservoir so it doesn t spill 23 x research source you do not have to thin or dilute zero paints before using them set your compressor between 20 40 psi turn on your air compressor and leave it running locate the pressure control buttons on your compressor and adjust the settings within the listed range higher psi settings will give you a more even consistent finish while lower pressure works better for finer details test a few of the pressure settings on a sheet of scrap paper to see what works best for you 24 x research source avoid setting the psi any lower or higher since you ll either overspray or cause the stylus to clog spray the first coat of paint onto your model hold the airbrush 2 3 inches 5 1 7 6 cm away from your model and press down on the button to apply the paint work in straight back and forth movements working from the bottom to the top of the piece always keep your airbrush moving so you don t apply too thick of a coat or else the model will have an uneven finish 25 x research source it s okay if you still see the primer through the first coat of paint wear a glove on the hand you use to turn and rotate the model just in case you overspray the paint let the paint dry 5 10 minutes between coats leave your model alone while it s drying so you don t smudge or ruin the paint job after about 5 minutes try touching an inconspicuous spot on the model if the paint feels tacky let it dry for another 5 minutes before moving on 26 x research source avoid applying another coat of paint while the first one is still wet or else you may have an uneven finish add another 2 3 coats of paint to the model switch the direction you paint with every coat so you don t see any visible paint lines make sure you focus on areas where you can still see the primer through the paint so it s not visible later on after each coat of paint let the model dry for 5 minutes or until it doesn t feel tacky 27 x research source some paints require more coats to reach your desired color for example you may need to use 1 2 additional layers of paint to get a vibrant yellow 28 x research source try switching colors between coats if you want to give your model a 2 tone appearance try only spraying half the model with the new color if you want to have the colors fade into one another if you want to add decals or racing stripes tape off all the areas where you don t want to apply paint before you start spraying the next color leave the model to dry overnight keep the model on the stand in your work area so it doesn t get disturbed allow the paint to dry and cure for a full day before you take it off or do any more work on it 29 x research source if you notice any blemishes on your paint job use 1 200 grit sandpaper to sand it down before repainting the area add a clear coat finish if you want the model to have a glossy appearance zero paints always dry with a matte finish so they need a clear coat if you want them to look like a real vehicle get a pre thinned clear coat from the zero paints website and load it into your airbrush spray the clear coat in a thin layer over the entire surface and allow it to dry for at least 5 minutes if you want a glossier finish you can apply another coat when you re finished leave the model alone for 2 days so the finish hardens 30 x research source you do not need to apply a clear coat to your model if you don t want to,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to find an illustrator,buying custom made artwork requires some degree of understanding of what the artist needs to know in order to fulfill your vision this is a guide to help you sound like a professional custom art buyer with ease a list of your requirements describing the art you envision for instance a color drawing of a dog running up a hill past a tall tree,know what you re asking for once your quest for the right illustrator has ended the next step is knowing how to instruct the artist to draw what you have in mind the best way to be satisfied with the art you order is to be extremely clear in your instructions the artist will appreciate a concise to the point order below is a list of questions designed to help organize your requests know how many illustrations you want be prepared for providing needed info for each illustration provide the following list of the elements to be included in the composition for example a drawing of a collie dog walking down a lane in profile past a line of trees with a clear blue cloudless sky in background the dog should be wearing a collar and have a pleasant expression decide if the art will the art be in color or black and white decide whether you want one or more prints a digital image or both if you are ordering prints decide how many and what size you want decide what purpose you ll use the art for know ahead of time what the eye hair and skin color of the subjects are decide if you will be providing reference material or if you expect the artist to procure it some artists will charge for finding reference material as it can be very time consuming you might consider finding the reference to save fees decide if there will be any text on the page do you want the artist to provide the text or leave room for your printer to place the text on the finished art if you want the artist to do it what font should be used if you are having your printing company place the text they can superimpose it on the digital art do you need the artist to design a logo and if so what are your ideas for it what is the message you want to convey do you want a logo you already have placed on the art can you supply a digital image of the logo you can ask the illustrator to show you samples of art they have which conveys the type and quality of the illustrations they create however do not expect them to have the exact thing you have in mind for instance if you want a picture of a bride on a skateboard and they have drawn skateboards and brides separately you can be confident they draw them together if the artist can draw an airplane but has not drawn a skateboard be confident they can draw the skateboard ask the artist if you will be supplied with a sketch before they go to the final finish do not expect the artist to redraw the picture if you change your mind for the original layout without incurring more fees,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to see life through the eyes of an artist,how do you see life through the eyes of an artist an artist is a person young or old with a gift to see the world discovered and undiscovered in different ways,observe someone who s interested in art and point out unique things in the room or setting what is the first thing that comes to your mind what is the first thing that comes to their mind an example would be if you see a black and white flower would the artist notice the positive and negative space and shading and angle of the flower whereas you just think its pretty art museums are a great place to go to try to see the world through the eyes of an artist because that s where artists have portrayed what they ve seen through their eyes try drawing what you see when you look at an irregular or odd object drawing helps to let you focus and break down line shape space and mass when looking at everyday objects if you don t have paper draw the item in your mind line by line and see how it adds up to create the object when looking at an everyday object memorize it in a familiar way then try looking at the space around the object or looking at it in a different way that someone else might see it artists see life in a different way literally something that looks like one thing to a normal person looks completely different to an artist if you aren t sure you think quite that way relax most people weren t born that way the brain is built to be wired and rewired so you can most certainly begin to think differently the next time you see an ordinary object like a chair don t think chair think something new something completely different something a little weird but don t be afraid of weirdness embrace it play that game with yourself where you say the first thing that comes to your mind if at first you get average results challenge yourself to think something completely different it ll be fun don t be afraid of weirdness its part of what makes artists so creative being able to think of something that no one else does makes you completely artsy and cool just think if people like salvador dali or picasso were normal would they be quite so famous try new things artists do new things all the time the unconventional the uncool the odd the eclectic if you see something you ve never seen before pick it up if you see an old place you ve never been to go inside you might be amazed at what you find even if you don t you should be willing to take the risk don t think of things as having only one solution or one anything no object has only one use no words only mean one thing the possibilities of anything are only as limited as you imagine them to be if you see something cool draw it or do whatever it is artsy that you like to do feel a perfect breeze write a poem about it see a funky outfit draw it hear a melodic sound write a song about it do a bit of what you do every single day if you do by the end of this year you will have at least 365 pieces of artwork you will boost your talent and also be quite prolific imagine you are someone or better yet something for an entire day pretend you are them speak like them walk like them behave like them true you may raise some eyebrows but let them rise the more you do the more quirky and individual you will become and then you will be able to have a deeper connection with that person or thing,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to upcycle old paintings,you may have received an old painting as a gift that simply does not fit your home decor or maybe you want to add some artwork to your house but are on a budget in either case you can upcycle old paintings to inexpensively make something fresh and new you could do this by adding personal touches to old paintings creating a chalkboard from them or making a collage with them,collect your supplies over the course of this project you re going to paint changes onto an old painting to make it unique new and interesting any supplies that you don t have on hand can be purchased at a local general retailer hobby store or hardware store you ll need drop cloth optional recommended old painting or print paint acrylic recommended paintbrush cup for cleansing paintbrush paper towel pencil palette or paper plate paper pliers optional 1 x research source take out the painting from its frame in most cases small fasteners will hold your picture in place in the frame these can usually be released with your hand but for especially old paintings or stubborn fasteners you may need to use a tool like a screwdriver to remove the painting frequently you ll find a rigid piece of cardboard or cardstock can be behind the painting also held in place by the fasteners remove this as well if necessary some paintings may be nailed into the frame grasp these nails with pliers and twist while pulling gently to remove nails plan the design you will add find inspiration from other painting or artwork then take stock of your painting look for spots where you might add a character animal or some other kind of embellishment for example you might add a pop culture image to your old painting like a zombie a character from a favorite tv show or movie or something to this effect 2 x research source you may want practice the image you plan on adding on a scrap piece of paper before modifying the painting if you re unsure of your freehand painting ability you might want to make and use a stencil prepare to paint you might want to lay down a drop cloth or newspaper on your work surface to prevent these from getting stained by drips or spatter fill your cup with water so you can easily cleanse your paintbrush of paint and switch to new colors pour the paint you will use on a palette or paper paint so it is accessible use the same kind of paint that was used for the original artwork for best results for instance watercolor paint will not show up on top of oil paint paint your base layer dip a clean paintbrush in your paint and wipe off excess paint on your palette or paper plate then apply the base layer of paint which will be the main color of your image then allow the paint to dry 3 x research source some examples of base layers include brown for a brown dog yellow for a giraffe orange for a fox black for a black cat skin tone for a human and so on if painting directly over top the old painting is daunting you can trace your desired image paint it separately then glue it into place on the painting depending on the kind of paint you are using the drying time will vary check and follow your paint s label instructions for best results add accents to your design now that the base layer is dry you can add detail to your image however less experienced painters might want to keep these simple to minimize errors cleanse your brush of paint by swirling it thoroughly in your cup of water wipe excess moisture from the brush onto a piece of paper towel reapply paint to the brush and add your accents 4 x research source for a pop of color add glitter or decoupage paper over the painting some details you might add include things like eyes nose s mouth s clothing glasses and so on remember to cleanse your brush and remove excess moisture from it when you switch colors otherwise the colors will mix and change return the painting to its frame when it is dry allow your detail work to dry completely before returning the picture to the frame check the label for best results but generally paint should be dry in 24 hours when it s dry slide your modified painting back into its frame if there is a rigid cardboard card stock backing replace this as well then close the fasteners to hold the painting in place your upcycled painting is ready to be hung gather your materials if you don t already have chalkboard paint you can purchase this at most craft and hardware stores any other supplies you are lacking can be found at most general retailers or your local hardware store for this project you ll need chalkboard paint drop cloth optional recommended old painting or print paintbrush palette or paper plate optional pliers optional screwdriver optional prepare your work area you ll be applying chalkboard paint to your old painting to transform it into a chalkboard so you may want to lay down a drop cloth to cover your work surface with a drop cloth to catch drips or spatter work on a flat level sturdy surface when painting large pieces or multiple pieces at the same time with chalkboard paint work in a room with good airflow to prevent the buildup of potentially dangerous fumes 5 x research source remove your painting from its frame depending on the kind of frame your painting is in you may have to adjust tabs holding the painting in the frame or remove fasteners with a screwdriver in some cases you may need to remove a hard backing like cardboard protecting the back of the painting when working with especially old paintings the fasteners may have degraded rusted or become otherwise difficult to adjust if this is your situation you may have to replace the fasteners if your painting has been nailed to the frame use pliers to remove these by pulling and gently twisting the nail free if you can t free the painting from the frame without damaging it cover the frame with masking tape and paint directly on the painting mix the chalkboard paint well for the best results you should follow the label directions written on your paint to determine the best method for mixing generally this involves closing the container and shaking the paint thoroughly 6 x research source paint your first coat on the old painting you may be able to dip a paintbrush straight into your paint container but if not pour some on a paper plate or artist s palette take your paintbrush and apply the paint in an even layer to the painted side of your painting 7 x research source use horizontal strokes left to right or vice versa when painting your first layer of chalkboard paint 8 x research source after your first layer is completely painted wait several hours for the paint to dry before adding a second coat 9 x research source apply the second coat once your first coat is finished drying add the second one in the same fashion as the first however this time use vertical up and down or vice versa strokes with your brush when your second layer is completed you ll need to let it cure for 24 hours to ensure a strong bond between the paint and painting 10 x research source after curing you should condition the paint so that it writes smoothly take a piece of chalk and rub its side gently against the paint until it is covered 11 x research source re insert the painting in its frame take your upcycled painting and return it to the frame replace the backing if there is any and refasten the fasteners to lock the upcycled painting in place hang the frame and enjoy your new blackboard collect your collage making supplies to create your collage you can use cutouts from magazines fabric or other sources as well in the example provided you ll use one of the prints paintings to form the background then cut features out from other prints paintings to add to this background altogether you ll need old paintings or prints several glue pliers optional screwdriver optional scissors take your paintings out of their frames use your hands to release the fasteners holding each painting in the frame if the fasteners are old and difficult to manipulate you might need to use a tool like a screwdriver to pry the fasteners open and remove the painting some of your paintings may have a rigid protective backing made of cardboard or cardstock remove this along with the painting if necessary use pliers to remove nails from paintings that are nailed into their frames do this by gently pulling and twisting the nails free with the pliers determine the composition of your collage the background you choose is purely a matter of taste when deciding your background however think about what aspects of the other pictures you want to use and how these might influence the end result 12 x research source unexpected combinations can really spice up peaceful paintings for example you might add army men or a killer robot to a pastoral scene 13 x research source to create the best layout arrange the collage on a flat surface and manipulate it to your liking before putting it on the painting cut out and glue the additions to the painting take your scissors and cut out the images from other paintings that you wish to add to your background add a thin layer of glue to the back of the cut outs then stick them into place on your background 14 x research source after cutting arrange the images on the background to see how it looks before gluing allow your glue to completely dry for the time indicated on its label for many glues this will only take a few hours to seal the collage apply mod podge or another decoupage sealer over the paper be sure to choose a product with your desired finish e g matte or glossy replace the painting in its frame slide your upcycled painting into the frame if there is rigid backing place this behind the painting close the fasteners on the back of the painting and hang your brand new upcycled painting,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to decorate a jewelry box,a repurposed jewelry box can be a great addition to your home décor or make a personalized gift for a friend customizing your very own jewelry box is fun and easy grab your paint paper and stencils and get started on your own one of a kind jewelry box,remove or spot clean the inside liner if possible remove the inside liner if not spot clean the liner with concentrated laundry detergent dab a bit of the laundry detergent on the stain and let sit for several minutes then use a wet cloth to scrub the spot away spray the liner with a water and vinegar solution if the box smells musty leave the jewelry box open and let it air dry before painting if the liner is too soiled use fabric tissue paper or paint to cover the stained liner 1 x research source clean the outside of the jewelry box with dish soap and a wet cloth if the jewelry box has glass panels remove the panes and clean with a glass cleanser use a residue remover for sticky substances such as tape or price tags make sure the outside is completely dry before starting to paint remove any hardware and gently sand the outside wooden surface use a medium grit sandpaper to remove bumps and scratches 2 x research source use a finer grit sandpaper to finish smoothing the wood wipe the jewelry box off with a damp cloth to remove any remaining dust apply primer to the jewelry box cover any part of the jewelry box you do not want to paint with paper and painter s tape apply a layer of primer and allow it to completely dry before painting paint the entire surface of the box you can use many different types of paint for a bold look use a bright colored acrylic or metallic paint for a more distressed look use a chalk based paint use stencils to add designs or create your own unique freehand patterns always remember to paint in thin even coats to prevent running 3 x research source chalk based paints need to be sealed with wax or the paint will rub off 4 x research source apply a layer of lacquer for a glossy finish 5 x research source make sure the paint and lacquer are completely dry before reattaching the hardware clean and sand the jewelry box clean the inside and outside surfaces with dish soap and water keep the box open and let it air dry once the box is dry use a fine grit sandpaper to smooth the outside surface after sanding wipe the jewelry box with a damp cloth to remove any extra dust pick out the images you want to use for your design cut out the pictures for your design many different types of paper can be used including wrapping paper scrapbooking paper and magazines 6 x research source the thinner the paper is the better thinner pictures lay flatter and use fewer layers of varnish to embed into the wood apply the initial layer of varnish and let it completely dry once it is dry use a piece of steel wool to gently polish the box arrange the pictures into your desired design once you have your preferred pattern apply some varnish to the back of the images lay the pictures flat and stick them to the jewelry box apply another layer of varnish to the entire box apply more layers of varnish continue to apply layers of varnish until the pictures are completely embedded into the wood surface let each layer of varnish dry completely before adding another layer lightly polish each layer of varnish with steel wool for a glossier finish clean the jewelry box with dish soap and water once it is completely dry gently sand the outside of the box after sanding wipe down the jewelry box with a damp cloth to remove any excess dust place your stencil on the part of the box you want to decorate use a repositionable spray adhesive on the back of the stencil spray on the adhesive until the stencil is sticky but not wet 7 x research source if you do not have a spray adhesive you can also use painter s tape to keep the stencil from moving 8 x research source use a tapping motion to paint your design take a flat bristled stencil brush and apply the paint onto your brush and wipe the excess paint off onto a paper towel tap the paint evenly onto the stencil paint the entire design at the same time do not swirl or swipe the brush when painting your design tapping the brush reduces the possibility of the paint bleeding 9 x research source remove the stencil from the wooden surface carefully lift the stencil to make sure to not damage the stencil make sure to let the paint completely dry clean your stencils to prevent paint buildup soak your stencils in soapy water right after use after soaking for several minutes gently rub paint off with a dish brush use a towel to pat dry the stencil 10 x research source store your stencils flat rolling your stencils can damage them pick a material to use for your design for a more reflective look use glass or mirror pieces beads and seashells give a textured look ceramic and porcelain are also common tesserae mosaic materials create your design you can do this by arranging the tesserae on the jewelry box or by drawing the design on a piece of paper for a simple design try a flower or multicolored circles or swirls for a more advanced pattern try creating a scene such as a forest or city skyline lay down the adhesive in sections try to avoid using too much adhesive it can dry out before you get to a section or push up between the tesserae leaving no room for the grout most silicone based adhesives work on non porous materials white glue also works well on jewelry boxes 11 x research source cut the tesserae into desired shapes and sizes you can use either a tile nipper or a wheeled glass nipper to cut tesserae in order to cut the pieces place the material into the mouth of the tool and squeeze down using these tools allows you to make specific sizes and shapes for your design you can also buy premade tesserae from craft stores place the tesserae onto the adhesive remember to leave space between the pieces in order to leave room for the grout a good rule of thumb is to leave 1 8 to 1 2 between pieces 12 x research source after you are done completing your design let the piece sit for 24 48 hours before applying the grout mix the grout in a disposable container follow the instructions on the package to make the grout add a tablespoon of water to the grout to give it an oatmeal consistency apply the grout to the entire piece wear gloves when applying the grout to avoid drying out your hands generously cover the entire design press the grout into the spaces between tesserae sculpt the grout around the edges wipe any excess grout off with hands let the grout sit for 20 30 minutes until it looks hazy always throw away excess grout never rinse it down the sink remove the grout from the tesserae take a very slightly dampened sponge or cloth and wipe the grout from the mosaic pieces do not use a paper towel they will flake and stick to the grout polish the tesserae to give your piece a sparkling finish use a dry cloth to polish the pieces,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to make your illustrations look professional,an illustrator is an artist that creates images to go along with advertisements articles and other media crafting professional looking artwork is a challenge but anyone can craft brilliant illustrations if they re willing to put in the time to practice you can improve your illustrations by drawing regularly pushing yourself to tackle complex subjects and getting familiar with the digital programs used by the pros with enough hard work your work will start improving in no time,select the location for your light source to guide your shadows and highlights select a single point either in the composition or just outside of it to place your light source it can be a lamp or sun in the drawing itself or you can imagine a light source outside of the composition itself use the light source throughout the drawing process to guide your shadows and highlights to keep them consistent 1 x research source to create dynamic shadows most artists choose to put the light source in the top right or top left of the frame it can really go anywhere though for amateur artists adding inaccurate highlights and shadows is one of the most common mistakes consistent light is one of the best ways to make an illustration look professional sketch out your initial design using lighter strokes it s hard to create a masterful illustration if jump right into the final line work start each illustration using a pencil or light drawing tool and outline the basic elements of your sketch this will make it easier to make minor adjustments and spot any problems with the composition before you get too far into the drawing process 2 x research source most professional illustrators work digitally but you can specialize in physical drawing if you d like many illustrators scan or photograph the work their physical work and touch it up digitally use a variety of different lines to create a dynamic composition as you develop your initial sketch use different line sizes and shades to build your drawing and create shapes use thicker lines to outline sharper features and thinner softer strokes to build textures and shadows alternate between using straight lines to add definition and free flowing lines to develop uneven shapes 3 x research source for example you may use harsher wider lines to outline the grooves in the bark of a tree then you might use lighter strokes to add texture and random jagged lines to give the wood grooves there is an exception to this for abstract and minimalist illustrations these styles rarely use a ton of different lines and often rely on a single type of line to create a sense of consistency in the work use color palettes that strike the viewer to grab their attention the colors you choose are crucial to developing a professional looking illustration use color palettes that contrast well with one another and suit your composition for example an upbeat minimalist drawing may use bright yellow pink and baby blue a darker image may utilize bright gray black and white alone 4 x research source use shades of the same color to make images look 3 dimensional and dynamic for example a basketball may be light orange on the right side where the light bounces off and a burnt orange on the opposite side where the shadow is there may be 3 5 different shades of orange in that single object choose contrasting colors to make different objects pop for example a black tie against a blue shirt won t stand out very well but black on yellow or white will pop off of the page incorporate your colors based on the medium and style you re using when you add your colors depends on your process and tools if you re using colored pencils or markers work from the lightest shades to the darkest colors digitally you can build your colors up as you go add watercolor or acrylic shades to physical work last and work over them after they dry as needed 5 x research source adding color last will emphasize the colors themselves and improve contrast adding the outlines and line work last will put the focus on the lines themselves it really depends on what you re drawing and what your goal is you do not have to use color but most illustrations tend to use it since colors attract viewers to dig deeper into the product or media the illustration goes with add your shadows and highlights once your subject is developed once your illustration has some detail and color begin developing the shadows and highlights use darker marks for the shadows and lighter marks for the shadows place your shadows behind any objects on the opposite side of your light source and do the opposite for your highlights this will give your illustration a sense of depth and make it feel professional 6 x research source popular shading techniques include cross hatching which is where you layer perpendicular lines over one another to create depth and contour shading where you add curling sets of parallel lines to make a shape feel round if you re working digitally the eraser tool is a great way to soften harsh lines and add highlights use high quality materials if you re making physical art pick up some nicer graphite pencils in a variety of different densities to make shading easier grab some drawing pads with acid free paper to preserve your work if you work in ink buy a bundle of high end art markers to make coloring and shading easier 7 x research source if you re working digitally there is no substitute for a nice drawing tablet with a good stylus this is basically the only hardware you need for digital illustration take advanced art classes to improve your overall skills look online for classes at local galleries or art shops contact your local university to look into taking some art classes

your illustration this is perfect for making really small adjustments that are hard to do on paper download texture packs or use the preloaded textures to turn flat shades of color into dynamic surfaces 19 x research source you can turn anything into a texture by converting an image into a new layer and changing the transparency make larger changes by adding additional layers or images to combine or add new elements to an image use the layer tool to add another surface to the artwork then import the second piece of art or a pre rendered digital object move it around on the illustration to create dynamic collages and intricate designs 20 x research source working in layers is one of the hardest parts of mastering an illustration program it s absolutely essential if you want to toy around with making major changes though you cannot import or use someone else s art in your illustration adjust the light levels and colors to make your illustration pop pull up the color sliders to

the rest of the piece play around with the colors in your art until you re happy with the way it looks 21 x research source saturation refers to the intensity of the colors professional illustrations are often highly saturated to make the colors pop as much as possible this attracts people and draws them in to look at the media associated with the illustration there are no hard rules when it comes to color it s entirely up to you as an artist to determine what the colors in your art actually look like use filters to change the artwork entirely and give it a new look there are a variety of filters built into your illustration program but you can find additional filters online filters apply a uniform texture or style to a piece of art without you doing anything by hand you can use filters to make your image look like it s from a comic book make it look like it was printed in a newspaper or adjust your drawing with a pattern or texture 22 x research source professional

how to write an artist s statement,it is quite hard to write a really good artist statement even if you re a good writer the statement accompanies a piece or set of work you ve painted drawn

things as well this exercise helps you move your ideas from your head to a piece of paper you can incorporate drawings into this writing process as well it may be helpful to target your writing to one specific question instead of trying to answer multiple questions for example you may choose to write about why you use oil to paint you can also write on multiple pieces of art paper instead of a notebook so that you can rearrange your ideas and make them more visual mind map your ideas a mind map is a visual diagram that lets you connect information to once central idea think of it as an idea tree 2 x research source write the answer to one of your questions in the middle of the page the you can use arrows or dotted lines for all of the answers to your questions 3 x research source all of the arrows and or dotted lines do not have to connect to the center of the diagram some of them may connect to each other you can also use pictures or drawings to communicate your thoughts and answers

better understanding of you and your work for example if you wanted your art discussed within the context of feminism you should clearly outline that in this part of your statement 10 x research source use clear concise language your statement should be easy to understand do not include any language that is too specific to the art world also avoid using complicated complex words your

rules but it is largely focused on creating artwork that is unique to the individual to create a neopoprealism artwork learn about the style practice it and then work on a simple project until you are ready to create work that stems purely from your own imagination,research the basic concepts of neopoprealism started by nadia russ in 1989 this art style is not interested in copying real life objects the human body or the ideas of others it focuses on breaking through limitations and opening your mind in order to create artworks that are unique you can do extensive research on this art form by looking for books on neopoprealism and taking classes that involve it in the curriculum 1 x research source along with being an art style it can be meditative and a great way to relieve aggression due to its repetitive patterns learn the 10 canons of neopoprealism neopoprealism is a style of art but it is also a philosophy the philosophy of this form is important because it influences how the art is created and what it looks like created by russ the 10 canons are 2 x research source be beautiful be creative and productive never stop studying and learning be peace loving and positive minded do not accept communistic philosophy be free minded do the best you can to move the world towards peace and harmony be family oriented and self disciplined believe in god god is one be supportive to those who need you be generous create your life as a great adventure story look up neopoprealism works by artists it s important to learn about the style but it s also important to see what the style looks like you can do an online search for neopoprealism you can also look directly on nadia russ s website for examples 3 x research source nadia russ also has a youtube channel where she draws an example of her style familiarize yourself with the basic techniques because neopoprealism is supposed to stem from a deep place within your imagination you are not supposed to think about what you re drawing there aren t many solid techniques like there are in other styles of art there are however a few basic techniques first you would typically start with a solid outline this outline can be anything like a face or a car then divide the object into sections and fill in these sections with repetitive patterns 4 x research source for example you could fill in the sections with repeated circles dots and swirls essentially take an ink pen and begin to create the repetitive patterns create repetitive patterns on a piece of paper without focusing on the results you have to be familiar with the style to begin practicing take out a blank piece of paper and a pencil begin to create right now the goal is to open up your mind and forget restrictions be unique never copy 5 x research source try a basic pattern if you do want some guidelines try to draw basic patterns for example start with a square then fill the square with patterns for example you could fill it with a lot of small circles triangles and wavy lines 6 x research source turn your practice drawing the repetitive patterns into a sketch basically you should use the lines to create the shape and sections then fill the sections with different patterns and ornaments if you can t think of what to draw draw a line that resembles the profile of a face it is actually the most interesting and sophisticated thing to draw then draw the basic features of that face with loose lines and shapes 7 x research source draw the profile of a face simple draw the outline of a forehead eye nice mouth and chin fill in the face with basic features if you desire or use patterns to draw an abstract version of a face a face is an example but you can draw whatever you want 8 x research source use a pen to draw your sketch you need a sketch only if you prepare for a large the wall size artwork like a mirror you need no preparation or sketches if you draw the small or medium size artwork nadia russ recommends using always a pen to draw in this style so that you can t erase what you ve created it s okay if the drawing looks different from what you ve expected it would be or if you make mistakes use your sense of harmony to fix the composition without eraser do not give up until you feel the drawing is complete 9 x research source deciding when the drawing is complete is entirely up to you you can stop whenever you can t think of anything else to add to the drawing the best judge here is your sense of harmony draw several patterns you can dive into creating the egg if you d like but if you are a beginner it s okay to start by generating ideas by drawing patterns take out a piece of paper and a pen never use a pencil fill the paper with several separate and unique patterns you can use those patterns to fill in your egg when you re ready 10 x research source for example you can draw repeated diamonds circles swirls curvy lines and triangles draw an egg shape on paper once you ve come up with some patterns draw the shape of an egg on a piece of paper you should only draw the basic outline and the inside of the egg should be empty it s okay if the shape isn t perfect but you can redraw it if you aren t happy with the first shape 11 x research source fill the egg with lines and patterns you can put some thought into this if you are a beginner or do it entirely without putting conscious effort into what you re drawing section your egg off by drawing several lines so that you create spaces for your patterns then fill those spaces with patterns like the ones you practiced don t stop until the entire egg has been filled unless you want to leave white space 12 x research source paint your pattern onto a wooden egg your artwork can be finished when you complete the egg on paper or you can use that egg as a base for a wooden egg this isn t necessary but it is a way to show off and display what you ve created take a wooden egg and acrylic paint in the colors of your choice use a thin paintbrush to paint patterns all over the wooden egg wait a few minutes for the paint to dry and then finish by spraying it with a clear varnish 13 x research source it s also an option to use transfer paper if you don t want to start the sketch over completely you can also use a marker or pen to draw on the egg if you don t want to use paint,Arts-and-Entertainment

petroleum jelly the paint will come right off 6 x research source if you think the paint might contain lead avoid removing or distressing it you could paint over it but it s best to consult a professional to avoid health problems 7 x research source upcycle a vintage window hang a salvaged window of any shape or size from the wall to display as art place it on a wall that receives direct sunlight for an interesting play of light to create a sense of variety complement curved lines with straight ones for example hang a circular window above a chair with a rectangular back 8 x research source you can also use each quadrant of a divided window as a picture frame hang vintage lithographs such as floral prints tack them to the wall with mounting putty or place them in small frames and hang them as you normally would you can find mounting putty online or in your local craft store 9 x research source hang empty frames as art if you bought an interesting antique frame but haven t found a painting or print to fill it try displaying the frame by itself you can choose to paint it a new color or keep the original paint job finish consider making it the centerpiece of an arrangement among paintings or prints 10 x research source create a gallery wall or collage using several empty vintage frames with unique details use old shutters as an interior backdrop with a little imagination the possibilities with old shutters are endless prop three or four behind the couch or chairs to create a sense of texture on an otherwise smooth wall fasten them to the walls if you choose not to place furniture in front of them 11 x research source on the other hand you can hang one or two shutters horizontally over the kitchen table to organize mail or display postcards 12 x research source decorate your kitchen with old cookware if your kitchen is done in neutral colors hang vintage copper pots and pans to create a rustic feel 13 x research source on the other hand if you prefer a more modern approach hang vintage enamelware you could also paint metal cookware with bolder colors go with colors that are in the same family as your wall color or aim for a more dynamic look by choosing contrasting colors 14 x research source unless you use fire rated paint avoid cooking with painted cookware use it for decoration only group smaller objects together do this if you don t have any large objects to complement them use objects that have something in common color scheme pattern subject matter etc arrange them in a manner that both shows off their variety and unifies them as a single work of art 15 x research source for example imagine you have three small vintage posters featuring forms of transportation one depicts a car another depicts a train the final one depicts an airplane look at each poster s use of line shape and color if the airplane poster has more vertical lines than the other two hang that one in the center 16 x research source create a symmetrical arrangement choose this option if you have an even number of objects with similar dimensions imagine a vertical line in the center of the arrangement if you have a laser level or painter s tape let that be your vertical axis then start arranging your hangings on each side of the line in a mirror image fashion make sure your artworks are evenly spaced 17 x research source for example let s say you have two rectangular paintings and two smaller square paintings you would place the two paintings immediately to either side of the vertical axis after that you would hang each square painting on either free side of the rectangular ones make a salon style arrangement choose this option if you have several objects of different sizes use the largest or most prominent object as the center of the arrangement position it at eye level group the smaller objects around it in some kind of logical fashion for example if you have a mixture of round and rectangular vintage prints try alternating each shape 18 x research source arrange objects on horizontal surfaces spruce up an nightstand mantle or desk with sculptures or two dimensional art lean framed paintings prints or photographs against the wall as an eye catching backdrop frame these two dimensional works with lamps flower vases or antique bookends place small sculptures candles or mantle clocks in front of them 19 x research source center large objects at eye level eye level is about 60 to 66 inches 150 to 170 cm from the floor if you hang your art too high or too low you and other viewers can overlook it place your artwork at a central point above your couch table or other location that will draw people s attention 20 x research source arrange objects on the floor first the last thing you want to do is create more holes in the wall than you need lay your intended objects on the floor then take the time to figure out an appealing eye catching pattern to hang them in 21 x research source map out your arrangement cut out pieces of kraft paper in the same sizes and shapes as each object you want to hang place them on the wall in the same arrangement you planned on the floor make sure you space all of your objects the same distance apart when each piece of paper is level secure it with painter s tape 22 x research source hang the objects on the craft paper mark the spot where the nail for each wall hanging must go then drive the nail through the paper template add a picture hanger if desired and gently tear away the craft paper finally install your wall hanging repeat this process until the arrangement is complete 23 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment

this piece look clean and finished does this piece show off my personality or voice as an artist does this piece reflect the type of style i want to do for work can this piece stand alone or is it part of a series if the latter do they also meet the same standard for quality are any parts of this piece particularly weak if so how can i improve it rethink including your earliest work unless it s specifically requested even if the first illustration you ever did is near and dear to your heart give newer work priority when it comes to selecting which pieces to put in your portfolio however if a school or hiring director specifically requests to see older work definitely include them if this is your first art portfolio and you only have 20 pieces to show it ll be a lot easier include all of it or leave out just a few 12 x research source newer work should get first dibs because odds are your skills have grown since you started plus your latest pieces are usually a better reflection of who you are as an artist right now adhere to any requirements of the school gallery or job application if you re making a portfolio to submit to a school gallery or particular job look up what they require and let that guide you you might even look at other artists they ve commissioned to see examples of the styles they re looking for 13 x research source for instance some schools like to see older pieces to show how your skills have advanced while a gallery may only want to see new pieces if a job listing specifically states they only want to see realistic illustrations only choose pieces that fall under that category i e don t include cartoon strips or surrealist pieces buy a sturdy portfolio book or case that s a little bigger than your pieces your pieces should fit into the book or case with at least 2 inches 5 1 cm of room to spare on each side after you insert your work into their sleeves so you can turn the pages and close it easily choose a case with sturdy covers that won t bend or get scratched over time 14 x research source a cost effective option is to use a booklet stitched to a larger outside cover it may not be able to take a lot of wear and tear over time but it s a good choice if you re a student making your first portfolio feel free to get creative with the material of your portfolio book cloth metal and wood covers can look just as professional and show off your unique style the benefit of using is a case is that it comes with a handle so you can carry it around like a briefcase some cases are padded so they can withstand weather and general wear and tear use art sleeves to protect your work when possible only include the original pieces in your work so the colors are as true as you intended and any textures are visible to the eye be sure to use plastic art sleeves so the originals don t bleed or get damaged 15 x research source you can buy art sleeves at most art supply stores and they vary in size from a4 a3 a2 and a1 pick the right size for your artwork and the portfolio book or briefcase you want to use take high quality photos of illustrations that can t fit in a portfolio case if you have massive illustrations that can t fit into a physical portfolio use a high resolution camera to take a photo of the piece so you can digitally resize it to fit your portfolio and print it out hang the piece on the wall or prop it up and place the camera at a height so it s in line with the center of the piece 16 x research source make sure you have good lighting that won t add too much warmth or coolness to the natural colors of the piece natural indirect lighting on a cloudy day will bring out the truest colors in the piece once you ve snapped the photo and downloaded it you can use photo editing software to crop resize or make minor adjustments photocopying can make the colors and textures look dull so take photos instead include only 1 piece per page of your portfolio make sure each piece fills most of the page and try to be consistent with the amount of white space around the actual illustration if your pieces take up the entire page try getting larger art sleeves with borders to make it look more professional 17 x research source if you have small pieces that go together feel free to group 4 to 6 of them evenly onto the page this is a good option if you did several little pieces for a single project start with a strong piece and order the rest to tell a story start with what you think is your strongest piece to get their attention and then order the rest in a way that hints at a cohesive narrative look through the pieces you want to include and group them by themes to help you decide the ordering there s no right or wrong way to do it so play around until you find an ordering you like 18 x research source for instance if you decide the theme of a particular portrait is geometric you might follow that piece with another that s heavy on stark shapes and lines it can be tough to critique your own work and find one you think is the strongest so ask a friend or mentor for their opinion if you can t narrow it down to 1 add an artist statement and lines of explanatory text if necessary write a short artist statement that touches on what you re trying to say with your art keep it between 150 and 200 words and include any themes influences or techniques that you may have referenced or used in your pieces if particular pieces were for prior commission work feel free to write 1 or 2 lines about who or what organization the piece was for underneath the work 19 x research source for instance as an artist i try to create work that reflects the celebration of the mundane in everyday life part of my process is spending a lot of time observing others in the state of boredom you can tuck copies of your artist statement into a side pocket of the portfolio book or have it be the first or last page you can also include small graphics of any products your piece may have been printed on e g tea boxes candles food packages below the piece make your portfolio revisable so you can tailor it to different jobs format your portfolio in a way that isn t too difficult to revise if you need to add or take out a piece make sure you can easily slide each piece in and out of the sleeves without damaging them in case you want to change the ordering this is crucial if you re just starting out and will be updating your portfolio more frequently 20 x research source don t spend a lot of money getting a professional book printed and bound because you won t be able to modify it once it s

how to critique your peers art work,we critique our art work to learn reinforce a lesson expand our horizons and to share ideas for new directions to explore as artists we play off each other and the world around us watch as bonds with the members of your art group grow stronger and confidence rises when you end each session with a critique,get your group together getting started is as simple as agreeing to hang work to look at it and comment on it pass this article around so everyone understands the basic rules remind artists that no two people could ever do the same work we are all unique in the way we paint our marks like our handwriting is our own so there is no fear of somebody copying your style reiterate that being competitive is not productive we are where we are as artists on that day in our journey some are bound to be more skilled but each and every person is an equal hang the work evenly tack all curling corners down make sure nothing is in a shadow or partially hidden people who have to leave early get to go first older work may be hung but it will get attention only after the new work is critiqued no finished pieces can be critiqued because once the artist says finished there is nothing to change always begin with a positive statement about the work you will be offering your thoughts and opinions about what you see before you so always begin with in my opinion or to my mind general statements such as i like it or it s nice are meaningless so try to isolate what works for you and be specific be sincere above all try to indicate one or two things that jump out that aren t working could use improvement refining or changing avoid picking the piece to death use the positive voice and be specific keep it brief and try not to repeat what others have already said if you have nothing to say simply pass become a more savvy and informed viewer of art ask yourself these questions when faced with giving a critique of an artwork or when viewing a work on display at a gallery museum or in a book what is the most striking thing about the work what pulls me in from across the room can i sum it up in a sentence at what point do i enter the work how is my eye led around and through it is anything leading acting as a directional sign to lead the viewer s eye out of the piece how important is the medium or technique would i do it differently how is the medium used could i duplicate it how much help is the title does it fit the piece what after a time away floats back to my mind about the piece refer to the elements of design in talking about a piece form shape such as geometric or free form line movement straight or curved space negative or positive mass versus emptiness hue color primary red yellow and blue secondary green orange and violet and tertiary yellow green blue violet red orange colors can also be analogous or next to each other on the color wheel complementary or opposite each other on the color wheel or other combinations chroma is the intensity or brightness of a color value the pattern created by lights and darks texture the surface quality of objects as interpreted by sight or touch for example rough smooth soft hard etc refer to the principles of design and how they are used in the piece alteration repeating in a definite pattern like wall paper balance formal and informal contrast conflict refers to the opposite of such as light dark rough smooth soft hard etc dominance one element having greater importance gradation closely related qualities organized progressively in a logical sequence harmony those elements that are similar variation a thing made different from the others present repetition the act or process of repeating again and again unity the quality of oneness a complete unit if you have a question begin by asking the group to focus on it however keep in mind that sometimes just hearing gut reactions is best people will be offering their opinions on the work but you are in charge of what happens eventually if anything it s your work and you are under no obligation to make changes be open to the thoughts and ideas generated but don t let others opinions deflate your enthusiasm if something cuts too deeply let it all go for a day or two and you will gain perspective and your confidence will return do keep putting up your work seeing it along with others is an education in itself you ll cross pollinate ideas and get new ideas for directions to explore be silent you are there to listen not argue defend or describe people are reacting and commenting on what they see at that moment before them not what you intended to do or how you plan to alter the piece do ask for clarification if you need it thank people for their time and interest in your work get past the fear of hard work sometimes especially with watercolor you will need to do the piece again put the piece away and after time passes you will be able to be your own judge pay close attention and you will learn almost as much from what is said about others work as your own,Arts-and-Entertainment

what you need to do to succeed at a convention apply early and with care many conventions start booking their booths nearly a year in advance you ll want to stay on top of deadlines for your chosen events and apply as early as possible most conventions have a set application including a portfolio and an artist s statement this will help the organizers determine if you re a good fit in genre and style 14 x research source however it s just as important to know if the convention is a good fit for you before you apply find out the answers to some of these important questions how much space is

re not just there to hang out you re there to promote your artwork and your brand be kind to everyone from guests to fellow artists to staff don t let your art spill over onto other people s tables

can refer back to you later 15 x research source pay for your booth or table at the convention on time otherwise your spot may go to someone else 16 x research source bring decorations to go with your paintings your paintings are what will hold most people s attention but you ll need to catch their interest first decorate your booth in a way that matches your aesthetic and corresponds to your

tablecloth to make an even professional looking workspace 17 x research source a standing banner with your name an art sample and contact information on it can go almost anywhere and commands attention without being too obnoxious 18 x research source be engaging now that you re all set up be friendly with the people who come by your table smile and say hi to browsers and try to master the

say when someone is looking at your work a smile and a simple hi there or hello works wonders it s easy to engage with buyers with sincere compliments i love your shoes as well use your network your professional network is probably bigger than you think it is and many of the most fruitful business relationships have sprung from personal friendships and connections if you re looking to sell art in a brick and mortar shop or gallery reach out to people you know who might be able to help introduce yourself provide samples of your recent work and ask for what you need 20 x research source you can network in person over the phone or over email just be polite 21 x research source if you re reaching out to your mother s old classmate say hi judy my mother told me a lot about your time together in

with old teachers and professors too they often have resources that could help you say i m looking into pushing my career into a more professional stage and i think exhibiting in a gallery could be

them again don t get too bogged down by criticism no artist meets with universal acclaim so just concentrate on improving by applying constructive criticism to your work consider consignment look for stores or boutiques in your area who you think would want to carry your items and reach out to ask if they might carry on consignment this way you pay them a portion of the profits if the item is sold consignment is excellent for three main reasons you get publicity you don t pay anything up front and you don t pay rent on the building where they are selling your items 23 x research source submit to galleries the last way to sell your paintings is arguably the one with the most professional appeal through a gallery a gallery is almost like a museum in that it s carefully curated and professionally staffed by art experts except that the art on its walls is for sale apply widely just like if you were applying for a job you probably won t hear back from every one but each contact is valuable when submitting to a gallery stick to the submission process it follows you can find this information on the gallery s website but you ll often be asked for samples and a statement especially if the gallery has a theme 24 x research source submit groups of artwork with coherent ties to one another for instance you could submit a series or several paintings you did at different times that

how to value your art,valuing art is the act of placing a dollar value on a painting sculpture or other artistic work appraising is an art not a science and market trends can quickly cause fluctuations in prices while most people hire an appraisal expert in order to arrive at a dollar value it s possible to arrive at an estimate yourself with just a few pieces of information whether you ve just bought a piece of art are preparing to sell one or are simply curious here s how to make your appraisal a lot less arbitrary,research the artist s output how many works of art did the artist complete the output of the artist in general greatly affects price prolific artists pieces of work tend to be less valuable than those of artists who simply produced less all things being equal find out if there are duplicates is the work one of a kind because of supply and demand works that are singular are worth more than replicated works for this reason a paintings is usually worth more than a print or a lithograph there are simply fewer of them out on the market pinpoint when in the artist s career the work was completed was the work completed early on or toward the twilight of their career interestingly enough works of art completed early in artists careers are usually valued higher than those completed later on 1 x research source why is this although it s not true in all cases early work tends to be more daring passionate and unpredictable sometimes owing to the artist s desire to establish a reputation for him or herself many appraisers believe that as an artist becomes more established in their career their art loses some of its derring do and boldness this artistic predictability is sometimes factored into the valuation ask yourself if the work epitomizes the artist s style works of art that epitomize an artist s aesthetic are usually appraised higher than works of art that are tangential or not representative of the artist s oeuvre pablo picasso s art is indelibly linked to an artistic movement called cubism currently picasso s most expensive painting le rêve which was sold in early 2013 for 155 million falls firmly in that aesthetic 2 x research source it is very emblematic of picasso s style in general investigate whether the artist is well known or has a reputation artists generally fall into three categories of renown well known up and coming and unknown artists who are well known and have a rich history of collection can almost always command more value more than artists who are unknown how much buzz is the artist attracting the more mentions they get in significant publications the better does the artist have any significant showings in galleries or did they in the past has the artist received acclaim from other art institutions such an prizes awards or achievement recognition do any museums own the artist s work artists who find homes for their art in museums can expect a significant uptick in the value of their work know that size matters generally bigger works of art are appraised higher than smaller ones usually because of the degree of difficulty involved find out if the piece of art has ever been owned by someone renowned barring the artist themselves works of art that were formerly owned by someone famous or well known can command much higher prices than those pieces who don t ha or condition issues an item that is ripped water damaged discolored or otherwise damaged can return significantly less than an item that is in perfect shape 3 x research source note that an item that isn t technically damaged but isn t as vibrant as it was when first completed will qualify as having a condition issue cleaning up an artwork or fixing condition issues can have a significant impact on its value cleaning up and fixing condition issues on an artwork can improve its bottom line up to 20 investigate market demand in short how many people want to buy the piece of art art is sold in a market this means that the value of items offered in the market fluctuates depending on how much buyers want the piece as well as how much they are willing to pay ask yourself if the market is in a peak where demand is usually high or a trough where demand is depressed if a glut of pieces enter the market the market price tends to go down if pieces are sold off or if a new group of buyers suddenly becomes active the market price tends to go up this is often referred to as supply and demand look at liquidity liquidity also called marketability is the reliability with which an asset or security can be sold without affecting its asking price 4 x research source in the art world high liquidity means that it s relatively easy to sell an item quickly and thus convert its value into cash low liquidity means that it s harder to do this creating a barrier to converting an asset into cash look at market trends related to demand pricing trends are usually the result of changes in people s perceptions of art or changes in their material circumstances in the early 2010s chinese billionaires flush with money began buying asian art sending demand significantly higher and signalling a new trend in the market 5 x research source as a result of this trend indian and asian art became a hot commodity in the art world collectors are willing to pay more of a premium for art in this market

of art is valued at after it has been sold at least once the secondary market value has a direct relation to what the item was sold for in the primary market 6 x research source one of the things you want to look out for is a certificate of sale especially if your item has been purchased at an auction referencing this document will make your ultimate appraisal much less subjective look at what other similar pieces of art have sold for if you ve just bough an impressionist painting in the vein of a painting that was just sold for 12 000 all other things being equal that should give you a good benchmark for what your painting may be worth when looking at comparables use a price range instead of a single price art appraisers generally say for example that a sculpture is worth in the 800 1 200 range instead of saying it s worth 1 000 know that one of a kind artworks are difficult to price and somewhat more subject to change an artwork that is truly unique and doesn t have any other analogues against which to compare it is difficult to value the appraisal arrived at is considered to be especially volatile look at scale intensity and medium scale is the size of the artwork and the level of detail intensity is the level of effort put into the artwork medium is the quality of the materials used combine these three aspects together and you should have a better idea of what your artwork is worth 7 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to determine if a painting is an original or reproduction,if you are buying a painting for your own enjoyment buy what you like and what feels reasonable but buying a work of art as an investment is very different it is not so much the art as who painted it and the provenance the proof of the artist s actual connection to the piece,do your homework research the piece know the artist s work look at many of his pieces compare signatures get close ups of the signature increasing your knowledge is critical to examining the piece and knowing what to look for when judging authenticity visit museums study the patinas if you ask to see the back of a painting the staff may show you examine the feel and look of old art works study the depth and number of layers of paint needed to achieve the color desired by the artist 1 x research source look at the front and back of the piece 2 x research source examine the patina of the piece itself dirt and dust of the ages texture the brightness of colors or lack thereof study the canvas do a thread count modern or old is there some patina on the back surface of the canvas look for anachronisms if the canvas is stapled on the back of a 1800 s piece of art something is wrong look at the patina of the wood to determine whether the wood is old determine how the frame is put together considering what kind of nails and hanger are used 3 x research source look for bristles painted copies sometimes will have hairs from the cheap paint brush still in the paint on the canvas 4 x research source use your nose when you do get your hands on the painting smell it it takes oil a while to dry and years to completely lose the smell of oil 5 x research source decide about how the piece feels to you balance everything many fakes for example have no depth of paint layers it s easy to copy a piece electronically but a photo copier cannot get the layers of paint a real piece has 6 x research source check for consistency a fake painted copy needs everything else to match frame wise and a patina is hard to reproduce get the work appraised if it is something you are in love with you need a third party to independently review it someone who is not in love how do you know if the appraiser is reliable he or she should have a certificate from one or more of the professional associations of art appraisers have a history of work with the particular artist or medium or period and preferably not be a dealer or broker of art himself one example is bernard ewell who is an expert in salvador dali whose prints are often copied research the market history of the artist what have other works of this artist sold for at other auction houses this size time frame and same medium 7 x research source note that some dealers perhaps including those on cruise ships may attempt to confuse the buyer with sizes and periods even mediums to sell a lesser piece at inflated prices look for signature and number for prints they must be signed and numbered signed in stone is of little interest because unlimited copies can be drawn 8 x research source research the gallery many pieces will have gallery stickers or information written on the back research that gallery to learn whether it is look for signs of wear there should be some signs of wear on the frame even the canvas sometimes wooden edges not quite as sharp after 50 100 years and drier research the artist for reputation know that some artists are known to have signed blank paper which later have prints drawn on from them which means the artist did not even supervise the pulls these would be of significantly lesser value salvador dali was know to have done this beware of a scam where the print is not numbered but another document is which is meaningless as any signed in stone can be used in place of the real item 9 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to talk about art,talking about art can be intimidating especially if you are not knowledgeable about the artist or the work of art you don t have to be an expert to look at experience and talk about art in fact art will often have a different impact on different people in order to talk about art learn appropriate terminology discuss the content of the image and assess how you feel about the image you can also spend time looking at the piece and reading up on the image and artist this will provide you with more information to discuss,talk about the materials used a variety of different materials can be used to make art and each of these materials will create a different visual effect for example sculptors can use stone marble wire or wood to create their art similarly painters can use watercolours oil chalk and pencil when you are looking at art comment on the materials or medium used to create the image if you can t identify them look at the label 1 x research source identify the style of art in order to sound knowledgeable while discussing art learn to identify the style of art for example some common and recognizable styles include abstract realist expressionist surrealist or impressionist a piece of art that uses realism can be easily identified because the artist attempts to create an image that looks real almost like a photograph 2 x research source alternatively an abstract piece of art does not attempt to mimic reality and instead can include random splatters of paint or lines to create a thought provoking image familiarize yourself with the different styles by searching online for images of the different styles of art for example search for impressionist images visit museums which often group art by style you may find yourself in a room of surrealist paintings for instance consider the content the style of art can also be described by looking at the content of the image for example learn the differences between portraits image of a person landscapes image of a place or still life image of an object works of art 3 x research source familiarize yourself with common descriptive terms it is also a good idea to know some descriptive words that you can use while describing art you can use them to describe the mood of the painting as you perceive it dynamic intimate suggestive challenging check the time period of the piece you may have heard of renaissance art modern art or cubism before these are a few different time periods and movements within art history to talk about a work of art check its time period consider how the historic moment impacted the way that art was created consider the movements that were happening at that time for example cubism was a type of modern art that was developed in the early twentieth century artists such as picasso departed from the romantic and realistic artwork of the late nineteenth century and began creating more abstract images 4 x research source think about any major world events such as war that may be reflected in the piece consider what was taboo at the time and place the art was made works that may not seem shocking now might have been then or vice versa talk about the composition and placement composition refers to the ways in which objects or shapes are arranged within a work of art for instance shapes may be placed near each other overlapping spaced apart or arranged in a pattern this influences the order in which you observe parts of the painting 5 x research source one way to notice things about the composition is to see where your eyes go naturally when you look at the painting for example you could say i m seeing that the artist has painted bright lights around the figure of the baby it makes it really hard to look away from that corner of the painting 6 x research source comment on the lines and brush strokes in some paintings you will be able to clearly see the brushstrokes and technique on the canvas you can comment on the way the brush strokes catch your eye and give texture to the image at other times paintings can look smooth almost like a photograph in this case the artist is likely going for a real life effect 7 x research source you could say this piece looks just like a photograph how does the artist create such smooth lines alternately you may notice really thick brushstrokes or blobs of paint you can comment on the sculptural thickness of layered paint notice the colors and contrast colour is another important element in art and can be used to capture your attention colours can create a contrast between light and dark or complement each other in a visually stimulating way when talking about art discuss how the color makes you feel and what you think it communicates 8 x research source for instance you could say the light and dark contrast in this image makes a sharp distinction between good and evil in this piece you can comment on the feeling of the painting that the color communicates this bright piercing blue invokes so much joy yet the muted red tones of the background feel more like a warning avoid delivering unnecessary judgements art is very personal and it is not always meant to make you feel good as a result you may offend people by giving harsh criticism instead you can comment on the art itself without saying whether or not you like it this allows you to comment on the work without giving your personal feelings avoid saying things like i could make that this type of comment is insulting to the artist and does not promote artistic conversation if you do dislike a piece you can explain that it s due to your personal taste for instance you can say i can see this is well composed i have trouble looking at this image though because it s so dynamic it almost feels violent ask questions a great way to assess a piece of art is by asking questions if you re going to talk about art questions are a great way to learn from your companions and promote conversation ask if your companion knows much about the artist or the art movement in question get the opinion of your companion about a piece acknowledge that you are not an expert if you are visiting an art gallery with a group of friends or colleagues and you do not know much about the kind of art you re viewing feel free to admit to confusion at any point some people in your group may actually be relieved to discover that they are not the only person outside of their comfort zone 9 x research source pretending to know a lot will be awkward and isn t necessary you might say wow i can tell a lot is going on here but i don t know where to start talk about how the art makes you feel the most important thing when you are thinking and talking about art is that it makes you feel something even if that feeling is unpleasant comment on how the piece makes you feel and why sometimes the artist will intentionally want the audience to feel uncomfortable this does not mean you need to judge the quality of work just the impression that the piece has left on you 10 x research source for example you may feel inspired sad happy confused uncomfortable angry etc take a long look at the piece of art most people only glance at a piece of art for example a survey done at the louvre found that the average person spends 15 seconds looking at the mona lisa this is not enough time to truly engage with a work of art try to spend at least a minute preferably longer looking at a piece of art this will allow you to take in the image look at the detail of the composition and determine how you feel about the piece by spending time looking at art you will more likely be able to talk about the piece and some of the finer details 11 x research source if you are able to stare at a work of art for long periods of time you may begin to create a dialogue with the piece this can be extremely interesting as you begin to see how the picture speaks to you read the title and description of the piece art galleries and museums will often place a small plaque near each piece to give the title and a small description this can sometimes provide you with details to help you interpret and discuss the art for example you may see a knot of light pink lines and feel confused upon reading the plaque you learn that the title of the work is my struggle with breast cancer the title of this piece may help you better understand what is being communicated through the art plaques can also include detailed information about the materials used date that it was created etc read up on the artist some galleries will also provide detailed information about the artists this material may be found in a pamphlet or in a small biography near the artwork learning about the artist may help you understand a bit about their interests and what inspired them to create this art this will give you more to discuss about the art,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to appreciate art,art can often seem inaccessible because it has been stereotyped in popular culture as something that only particularly educated or wealthy people can enjoy however this couldn t be further from the truth anyone can come to appreciate art with a little bit of time and effort learning about the context around a work of art understanding the craft and using your imagination to bring your own interpretation to art can help you enjoy it more,understand the historical context of the time when the art was produced artists often create works to comment on major historical events and this can give you a window into their unique perspective in contrast powerful institutions and people throughout history often commissioned artists to create pieces that endorsed their agendas this affects the intended audience of the art piece who was meant to see the art 1 x research source for example pablo picasso s guernica 1937 was created in response to the bombings during the spanish civil war it s filled with anti war symbolism 2 x research source picasso said of the artwork painting is not done to decorate apartments it is an instrument of war against brutality and darkness 3 x research source during the renaissance the roman catholic church relied a lot on commissioned art as a means of promoting their cause and asserting their power find out the genre of the painting if you re looking at a painting knowing what genre it belongs to can be helpful genres are essentially categories that are used to classify art in painting the established and well known genres are landscape portraiture genre paintings which are paintings of scenes from ordinary life history and still life 4 x research source john constable s the hay wain 1821 is a famous landscape painting that led to the resurgence of landscape painting in the 19th century 5 x research source girl with a pearl earring 1665 by johannes vermeer is considered to be a masterpiece of portraiture 6 x research source judith leyster s carousing couple 1630 is a great example of a genre painting 7 x research source history paintings depict a moment in a specific historical narrative vasily surikov s the morning of the streltsy execution 1881 is a very intricate history painting example 8 x research source lastly still life paintings are of inanimate commonplace objects van gogh s sunflowers 1889 is a bright and sunny still life example 9 x research source learn about the art movements or schools that influenced the piece art movements were surges in popularity of certain ways of creating art an art school is basically just a group of artists sometimes all in the same region who all have a similar style or subject matter knowing a little bit about these can help you understand why an artist might have made certain choices for example painters in the egyptian school of art had certain rules that they had to follow like the size of any figure they drew was supposed to vary based on the social status of the person they were painting they also couldn t use more than six colors and each color symbolized a different aspect of life or death impressionism one of the largest 19th century art movements is defined by short loose brushstrokes that are intended to capture the quality of light 10 x research source read up on the life and perspective of the artist learning a bit about the artist who created a piece can help shed light on it in a variety of ways it can help you understand why they made certain artistic decisions or chose to make the work at all in the first place 11 x research source for example mexican painter frida kahlo had limited mobility after fighting off polio and enduring a bus accident in her early life her pain and struggle manifests in several of her pieces 12 x research source learn when the piece was produced art museums typically have informational plaques next to each work that will provide basic information about the piece knowing when a piece of artwork was created can help you appreciate the difficulty involved in making it for instance landscape paintings produced before the rise of photography which began to include landscapes around 1860 were definitely more challenging to do 13 x research source identify the medium that was used to make the art a medium refers to the material used to create a piece of art the type of material used affects how the artist made the piece if you can t tell which medium was used museums or galleries will often state the medium of an artwork on informational plaques oil and acrylic paints are examples of media for painters while bronze and marble are media for sculptors with the rise of modern art media has expanded to include not just types of paint and stone but also materials like found appropriated objects or even bodily excretions this has led to the creation of the term mixed media which is used when talking about an art piece made from a variety of materials 14 x research source recognize the artist s effort to convey lines for visual works notice the artist s ability to create confident lines lines are created when an artist draws or paints marks on a page when a sculptor bends or shapes material or when a photographer angles their camera a certain way some ways to describe lines are dashed bold rough smooth or implied 15 x research source pay attention to the shapes that stand out in the painting note any interesting shapes that grab your eye when you look at a piece of art and think about how the artist achieved them shapes can be geometric or organic geometric shapes are simple commonly recognized shapes like squares or rectangles organic shapes are unique and free form looking at still life paintings of fruit is a great way to understand how artists have experimented with shape 16 x research source notice how the artist uses color ask yourself why the artist chose to use the combination of colors that they did and if these colors work in harmony or contrast color has an enormous effect on how we feel when we look at a piece for example pieces with blue undertones are known to have a calming effect on the viewer meanwhile yellow is associated with light and feelings of optimism 17 x research source study the brushwork of a painted piece brushwork or the way that the artist applied paint using their brush really sticks out when you are looking at paintings in person it s used to create certain effects in the art contributing to both texture and mood for example the feathery light brushwork in impressionist paintings is intended to mimic the qualities of light harsh and erratic brush strokes can communicate a sense of tension and anxiety in a piece 18 x research source keep an open mind you will never know if you like or don t like certain types of art if you don t try to enjoy them you can think of going to see new kinds of art as exposing yourself to new experiences rather than just seeing art 19 x research source evaluate how a work of art makes you feel be in touch with your own emotions as you view art do you feel excited calm anxious confused art can evoke a wide range of emotional responses so do your best to be conscious of yours offer your own interpretation of what the art means part of the fun of viewing art is that you get to come up with your own story about it art is very subjective so even if your interpretation of a piece isn t exactly what the artist intended it s okay there is often not just one right answer what s important is that you make a genuine effort to extract meaning from their work 20 x research source because every person has a different set of unique experiences it s valid for every person who views a piece of art to walk away with a different understanding of it this can lead to interesting discussions ask the person next to you what they think 21 x research source it s also completely fine to offer no interpretation at all and instead just enjoy the art for its physical properties 22 x research source applaud the ambiguity of abstraction abstract art art that doesn t look like anything in the real world can be a little harder to appreciate because the message or emotion that the artist is trying to convey is not always immediately clear to enjoy abstract art think about what grabs your eye first in the piece and why the artist might have wanted your attention to go there abstract art can be fun because it s like a puzzle you really have to give it some thought to come up with a potential meaning for it remember your meaning doesn t have to be necessarily correct learn what you like and don t like as you view more and more art you will start to develop an understanding of what you like and dislike in a piece of art this can help you seek out similar artists you don t have to love everything that you see artist statements or descriptive brochures can sometimes be misleading so if you unexpectedly don t like a certain type of art that s fine 23 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to arrange artwork on a wall,arranging art on a blank wall can seem overwhelming at first the trick is to let your art personal style and the space itself guide your decisions figure out whether you d prefer a uniform or eclectic look and decide what would look best in the available space look for themes in your collection and choose objects that fit the tone you re trying to achieve play around with various configurations until you ve found the right balance when it s time to hang your arrangement make careful measurements to precisely position your artworks,look for themes within your collection if you need to decide which works of art to display try to come up with a theme look through your collection think about your style and decide what kind of tone you want to achieve figure out whether you prefer uniformity or more eclectic looks and decide what would look best in your space 1 x research source suppose you have lot of works in one genre such as portraits or landscapes and want a more uniform look you could create an arrangement of works solely in that genre and use frames with consistent sizes and colors if you like visual puns and storytelling look for objects in your collection that relate to each other in clever or interesting ways for instance a pair of portraits might seem to glance at each other as if they re laughing at the same joke combine contrasting colors and forms for an energetic arrangement if you want a vibrant dynamic look choose a wide array of colors and artistic styles mix up abstract works with representational landscapes portraits and still lifes include as mediums as you have in your collection such as paintings drawings prints and photographs 2 x research source display black and white or monochromatic works for a subtle look for a more minimalist chic look look for artworks that fit a particular color scheme you could arrange black and white photographs charcoal drawings and black and white paintings black and white frames would reinforce your arrangement s uniformity 3 x research source if you re going for a cohesive arrangement but still want a pop of color you could go for a monochromatic look for example display works together that are all predominantly blue use frames to create uniformity or variety while frames shouldn t overwhelm artworks you can use them to complement your arrangement s theme mix up your frames to create a dynamic look or use frames with consistent sizes and colors to impart unity 4 x research source for example suppose you want to cluster several similar works but don t want your arrangement to be static use frames with different sizes and materials to add variety to your collection 5 x research source if you want to unify a broad range of mediums colors and sizes use all black frames wood frames or frames with equal thicknesses choose an arrangement that suits the space the wall itself should guide your composition s form for instance fill an irregular narrow nook with a clustered floor to ceiling arrangement 6 x research source suppose you have a large rectangular dining room with a long table a linear arrangement of artworks displayed in equally sized frames and hung at the same height will complement the room s horizontal lines 7 x research source work your furniture into your arrangement make sure your artwork doesn t crowd your furniture and that your furniture doesn t obscure your artwork additionally set your furniture layout before arranging your artwork you wouldn t want to hang a floor to ceiling arrangement then hide or risk damaging a painting by placing a chair in front of it 8 x research source if you re placing artwork over a bed or a sofa hang it about 8 inches 20 cm above the headboard or sofa back large scale works hung above a large piece of furniture should be between 65 and 85 percent of the furniture s width larger works could dwarf your furniture and smaller works could leave too much blank space 9 x research source go with a grid if you have several equally sized works grids work best for series of images that are all framed exactly the same while artworks in an array of colors scales and mediums can add variety the frames dimensions should match precisely 10 x research source for example you could mix up drawings or paintings on paper colorful prints and black and white photographs frame them in equally sized white frames with white matting then hang them in a uniform grid keep in mind you ll have to hang a grid as precisely as possible a grid s uniformity will magnify even the slightest misalignment cluster your works salon style if you want an eclectic arrangement dramatic eclectic salon style installations are popular in contemporary interior design however a salon style arrangement is more complicated than randomly hanging artworks wall to wall and floor to ceiling take the time to find a configuration that balances works color palettes proportions and other visual elements 11 x research source for instance mix up scales to create a balanced composition instead of clustering small works on one side of the arrangement and larger works on the other pay attention to frames too scatter frames styles evenly instead of grouping ornate frames in one part of the arrangement and simple frames in the other strike a balance between clustered and geometric styles you don t have to choose between a strict grid and dramatic salon style cluster for the best of both worlds choose artworks in a range of mediums with various color palettes and scales arrange them in a balanced configuration that defines a square or rectangular area 12 x research source for example 2 large scale objects could define the upper right and lower left corners of a rectangular arrangement you could then use groupings of smaller works to define the rectangle s other corners arrange your art on the floor to find the best composition when you have a general idea of the look you want to achieve lay the works on the floor experiment with different configurations and move them around to see how various colors forms subject matter and scales relate 13 x research source planning out how your works colors and proportions relate is especially important if you re going for a clustered or salon style look when you play with arrangements avoid crowding artworks leave about 1 1 2 inches 3 8 cm between smaller objects and about 2 inches 5 1 cm between large scale works 14 x research source set focal points 60 inches 150 cm high after arranging your artworks on the floor and finding the right configuration figure out how high you should hang them the general guideline is to hang an image so its center is 60 inches 150 cm high for a grid or cluster you d set the focal point or center of the arrangement at that height however that figure isn t set in stone and there are plenty of exceptions to the rule 15 x research source for example if you have high ceilings you might need to hang works higher to minimize blank space between them and the ceiling you might also need to make adjustments in order to leave enough space between an image and a large piece of furniture 16 x research source the height guideline doesn t really apply if you re going for a floor to ceiling wall to wall look tape paper templates of your artworks to the wall trace templates of your artworks on butcher paper or newspaper cut them out and tape them to the wall in your desired configuration shift them around to make final touches to your layout such as setting enough space between artworks and adjusting hanging heights 17 x research source use low adhesive masking tape so you can shift the templates around without pulling off your wall s paint use a bubble level to double check your templates levelness if you have a laser level project level lines where you want to hang templates mark the templates top center points when you ve found the right arrangement measure a template s width at its top edge and locate its center point use a post it note piece of tape a pencil to mark the top center point repeat the sequence for each template 18 x research source measure 2 hanger locations on each artwork place a finger on either side of the hanging wire about 2 to 3 inches 5 1 to 7 6 cm from the edges of the frame or canvas pull the wire toward the top of the object to simulate the wire s position when it hangs on picture hooks measure the distance between your fingers and the object s center then measure the distance between the pulled wire and the top of the object 19 x research source for instance suppose you pull the wire at points 3 inches 7 6 cm to the left and right of the frame s vertical center imagine a line going through the center of the frame from top to bottom then when you pull the wire toward the frame s top there are 2 inches 5 1 cm between the wire and frame s top you ll note those measurements and use them to nail picture hooks into the wall at the right spots hanging artwork with 2 hooks keeps it from shifting around which helps maintain levelness and prevents wall damage for works without hanging wires such as those with d rings measure the distance from the ring or hook to the top of the frame mark the hanger locations on the wall find the post it tape or pencil mark for a template s top center point at the top edge measure the distances to the right and left where you placed your fingers and pulled the wire from those points measure the distance between the pulled wire and top of the template then mark those spots 20 x research source for example measure 3 inches 7 6 cm to the left of the center point from that spot measure 2 inches 5 1 cm down from the top edge then make a mark repeat the steps on the right side and mark the spot that s 3 inches 7 6 cm to the right of the center point and 2 inches 5 1 cm from the top edge to mark your spots draw a dot on the template with a pencil or make an indentation with a nail factor in your picture hooks when you make your marks if your picture hooks hang below the nail that supports them measure the distance between the hook where the hanging wire will rest and the hole where the nail fits factor this number into your measurements to avoid hanging your artworks slightly lower than you desired for instance if the wire will rest on a hook 1 2 inch 1 3 cm below the nail hole hammer the nail into the wall 1 2 inch 1 3 cm above the mark you made in the previous step if you don t make the adjustment your artwork will hang 1 2 inch 1 3 cm lower than you planned nail picture hooks into the wall place the picture hook against the wall line its nail hole up with the mark on the template then hammer a nail through the hook into the wall you can hammer nails straight into the marks you made on the templates then tear away the template when you ve installed both hooks just make sure you keep track of which object goes in that spot 21 x research source hang your artwork and double check levelness finish hammering before you start hanging your art after hammering the last nail start mounting your arrangement use a bubble level to check each object s levelness then step back and admire your handiwork,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to arrange artwork at home,arranging your artwork properly can enhance the look of any room in your house if done correctly it will help the flow of the room and add to the style and aesthetic that you re trying to achieve the only problem with arranging your artwork is that it isn t always so intuitive luckily if you plan and choose your arrangement carefully you can arrange your artwork to enhance the look of your house or apartment,choose the appropriate method to hang your artwork based on its size methods to display your art at home include hanging it leaning it against the wall or placing your artwork on top of a shelf determine how you want to display your art at home and utilize a venue that works with the quality and size of the art for instance larger and heavier pieces of art could be leaned against the wall while lighter pieces of artwork can be matted or hung on the wall it s best to lean large heavy pieces of art against the wall or your art may be knocked over or stepped on use photo frames that can be propped up if you re placing your art on a shelf you can also lean your art against the wall for medium sized pieces but they may fall and break more expensive pieces of art should be framed and hung on the wall black and white photographs of family and friends can be placed on top of a shelf expand your idea of what art can be you can frame postcards maps old collages or scrapbooking pages as an inexpensive alternative to traditional artwork prints or posters can be matted and then attached to the wall select your aesthetic style the easiest way to determine your preferred aesthetic is to simply choose art that you like think of how the art that you choose reflects your personality as well as the effect that the art will have the on space choose bright and expressive art to lighten up a dark room or darker colored art to show your maturity and refinement if you re looking to convey an edgy urban style hanging brightly colored pop art or graffiti art may be a great option black and white photography can add a sense of refinement to your space determine how it will affect the look of furniture in your space objects like desks tables and couches can affect the way that you should arrange your art depending on where they are located for instance when hanging art above a couch the art should be 6 to 8 inches 15 2 to 20 3 centimeters above the top of the couch 1 x research source other things should also be taken into consideration include making sure your art matches the tone and style of the room you can achieve this by matching the art s color palette with the color of your furniture and wallpaper another example is if you have a refined and adult looking study using refined looking figure drawing or scene art could help enhance the look of other things in your room if you have rustic art but a modern sofa separate them in the room to avoid the two styles clashing arrange your artwork on top of a piece of butcher paper before you hang your artwork and create unnecessary screw or nail holes you can lay it out on the ground to get a feeling for how it will look when finally hung lay down a large piece of disposable paper and lay your artwork over it configure your art by starting with the largest pieces and then arranging your smaller pieces around it envision how it will look on your wall and choose a configuration that you find aesthetically pleasing rectangle square and diamond frames typically look best when hanging art smaller pieces of art look best when grouped 1 to 2 inch 2 5 5 cm apart from one another while larger pieces of art typically look best with a 3 inch 7 6 cm border around them 2 x research source cut out the butcher paper around your photos use a marker to make an outline around your artwork onto the paper remove your artwork once you are done and cut out the outlines you drew you ll use these pieces of paper to act as a visualization of how your artwork will look on the wall 3 x research source if you rearrange your artwork on the floor next to your sheet of paper you can save your design so you don t forget where your pieces of art should go tape your butcher paper to the wall once you ve finished cutting out all of your pieces you can now hang it on the wall with scotch tape it s possible that your layout will look very differently on the wall than it did on the floor the centerpiece of your art arrangement should be about 5 feet 1 5 meters tall so it s eye level with most people 4 x research source if you have high ceilings you can opt to hang the art higher than usual avoid placing your art above eye level in a room with standard ceilings as this can make your room look imbalanced evaluate your layout and rearrange it take a couple of steps back and assess how your arrangement looks on your wall if you re unsure taking a break may allow your brain the rest it needs to evaluate the layout objectively 5 x research source if you don t like something about it move your pieces of paper around until the layout looks perfect arranging the layout perfectly in this step will help you avoid drilling unnecessary holes when you hang your art if your floors are uneven using a level may help you line up your artwork ask a friend to give you a second opinion regarding the positioning of the art before hanging it they can help you determine what s most visually pleasing hang your art replace your pieces of paper with the artwork that you intend on hanging mark where you want the art to hang with a pencil hang your art on your wall using a nail or other mounting method popular mounting methods include using a wall anchor a nail or a hanging hook when hanging larger and heavier artwork you may need to use a drill to drive larger anchors into your wall studs 6 x research source command hooks and easy off tape are great hanging alternatives if you re a renter or don t want to damage your walls use the same frames and matting different styles and colors of frames will throw off your arrangements cohesion use frames that have a similar style size and thickness 7 x research source if you have a bunch of mismatched frames a cheap and easy solution is to paint them all the same color 8 x research source matting is the material that s used behind the photo and should also have a uniform tone though it doesn t always need to be the same color your artwork should maintain a uniform color across your different pieces if you want to save money you can paint mismatched frames the same color leaving frames mismatched can also create an eclectic look if that s your style take a look at the dominant colors in your artwork and choose a mat that shares the same colors typically artwork has a focal point and your mat should be the same color as the focal point of the artwork use high contrast mat colors to add drama to a set of artwork 9 x research source determine if you want symmetry or asymmetry hung art can either be symmetrical or asymmetrical but should be consistent wherever you are arranging it symmetry is when your art corresponds to size shape and spacing in relative position to a center line on the x axis when you reach symmetry your arranged artwork will look centered and balanced if you have various sized frames or art it may be a better idea to create an asymmetrical look asymmetry is also useful when hanging abstract art 10 x research source to hang your art symmetrically either imagine or draw a center line horizontally on your wall parallel with the floor hang your pieces centered on that line this is much easier to achieve when all of your art is the same size to hang your art asymmetrically imagine or draw a center line and vary the height and distance of each piece of art about the line if you want to hang a piece of art above some furniture find the center of the furniture piece not the center of the wall this will help your art look centered in the room to the eye create a theme the way that you group your hanging artwork is important try to group art that shares a similar aesthetic or theme among your collection for instance you can arrange family photos together art that shares a similar style or black and white only or color only photography this will give your art arrangement a deeper feeling of cohesion your artwork should be a representation of who you are or what you like try to achieve that by using pieces that you feel represent you choose a theme to create an interesting gallery wall that reflects your style you can go nautical rustic modern or shabby chic for example,Arts-and-Entertainment

online to a larger market to make a quick buck frequent art fairs to get a good span of work to choose from if you re simply trying to make money and don t care about the art consider buying into an art investment fund investment funds are pools of money that are used by a panel of experts to make informed purchases on behalf of their investors and operate like mutual funds choose a market that you want to begin buying and selling in buying art on the primary market means that you re purchasing pieces directly from an artist or auction house before the work has ever been released to the public the secondary market is where current owners of a work buy and sell art the primary market can be hard to interpret without knowing what the secondary market s demand is but it s also where you stand to make the most money from an artist or auction house underpricing a work 8 x research source start by looking for lesser known artists that have some buzz look at reviews of gallery openings and write down the names of any artists that receive praise for interesting work don t pay attention to reviews that focus on technical skill instead look for criticism that describes the work as forward thinking or visionary this is often an indicator that an artist has tapped into a unique style or process that may catch on as time goes on 10 x research source the art market doesn t generally focus on the technical ability of an artist when determining value instead a price is usually predicated on the artist s process a piece s thematic elements and the context of a work as a general rule of thumb avoid purchasing art from students that are still in master s or ph d programs it can be impossible to tell how the market will or won t respond to their work identify famous artists whose work increases in value over time while you re probably not starting out by purchasing an original warhol or pollock there are thousands of artists making work out there that fetch 4 5 figure price tags investigate the names of artists you hear mentioned in art publications and go to local auctions to hear what kind of prices mid level artists are getting for their work 11 x research source go to a few auctions without the intention of buying anything write down the names of the artists with work for sale and research them to identify trends and up and coming artists attend gallery openings and talk to the owners go to gallery openings and look for the owner kindly introduce yourself and explain that you re looking to get into the world of art investment they ll ask you about your collection to try and gauge what you re looking for so have a few photos available on your phone to share what you re interested in buying if you don t have a collection tell them they ll be able to help you get started as a collector smaller galleries tend to have very active owners that will be willing to chat about potential investments you ll get more information and knowledge from local gallery owners than major museum curators who won t really take you seriously at first go to art fairs and interact with the artists art fairs represent a rare opportunity to expose yourself to large quantities of art all at once they also provide an opportunity to interact with a large number of artists since the art at art fairs is usually sold directly by the artist introduce yourself to painters photographers and fine artists whose work you re interested in 12 x research source even if you don t end up buying anything you ll learn a lot simply by talking to artists about their processes and how they end up establishing prices based on the demand for their work art fairs are also a good way to judge the local demand in your market if art fairs in your area tend to be empty and poorly attended it may be a sign that it s a bad area for you to be looking to buy and sell attend auctions to meet other investors fine art auctions are a tremendous resource for networking with other investors in your field introduce yourself to the people that bid on works at an auction and ask them about their investment strategy talk to them about their collection and exchange phone numbers to stay in touch if you can build a relationship with other investors you may be able to get the inside scoop on rare collections and insider opportunities in the future 13 x research source auctions are events where potential buyers bid against one another to buy expensive goods they have their own set of social norms and rules so they may seem overwhelming at first to play it safe don t plan on bidding at the first couple of auctions that you attend auctions are usually free and open to the public high end auction houses may require tickets but they usually only use them to know when they re at capacity so they re usually free 14 x research source contact an artist directly to look into buying their work if you stumble upon an artist with work that you re interested in contact them via email or show up at a gallery opening and tell them that you re interested in potentially buying their work they ll likely have more work that they d be able to show you and you ll be able to learn more about a specific piece that you re interested in buying 15 x research source most artists have personal websites where they showcase and sell their work some artists will be resistant to working with a buyer that wants to buy their art as an investment especially if they re well established in their field many established artists have representatives and agents that deal with potential buyers if you know an artist is being represented contacting them directly can come off as an insult to the artist enlist gallery owners to keep an eye out for work you re interested in gallery owners make a living buying and selling art they are likely to be regularly purchasing or soliciting investable art ask gallery owners to keep an eye out for work that you might be interested in buying you ll be the first person they call when they come across a potential investment 16 x research source hire an evaluator to appraise your art before buying or selling evaluators are professional appraisal experts and their estimates hold quite a bit of weight when it comes to selling or buying art a professional evaluation will put potential buyers at ease since they ll know that they aren t overpaying for a work inversely a professional evaluation will let you know whether or not a potential purchase is worth considering at its available price 17 x research source most galleries and studios have specific evaluators that they work with ask about evaluations when inquiring about a piece s price contact the gallery that you bought a piece from before selling it gallery owners will appreciate the ability to offer a piece to their clients before you put it on the open market without their assistance apart from being a courtesy it s possible that the original gallery owner will have buyers readily available for you since they re in contact with other people that are likely to have the same tastes in art 18 x research source market your art online

looking to turn your investments into possible short term windfalls 13 x research source note that this is an inherently risky endeavor as not all art is guaranteed to increase in value you probably shouldn t spend all of your money on this type of art if you re looking to invest for the best results look for art that is featured in cutting edge galleries or museum shows and that was painted by

how to start an art collection,art is subjective fascinating and driven by passion here are some top tips on how you can get involved,figure out your own motives do you want something to brighten up your room or match the curtains or are you hoping to make money from the recovering art market or are you attracted to art as a fascinating long term commitment be aware that each of the above motivations are relevant and each requires a different game plan if you are looking for something you like then it s easy go with your gut feelings if you are investing then you must do your homework and build contacts in the art world that you can trust in other words you can buy art from a west london heavyweight dealer and be assured of its quality but end up spending more money or you can go to an east london gallery that showcases young artists and spend less money but with more risk whichever you choose you must be prepared know that rarity equals value as well as quality so one off originals are more valuable than multiple prints paintings drawings and collages are normally one offs but sculptures are often produced in editions of nine understand the smaller the edition the higher the price one way to make sure of this is that the artwork you like is signed and numbered this is also true of photographs of course photos can be reproduced very easily so seek verification do your research is the artist dead then make sure that the photo is vintage ie authorized by him or her if the photo is modern then does it come with the original negative to ensure that it isn t a copy also in today s age of digital photography some studios make a point of producing hand printed signed originals educate yourself art they say is an intellectual pursuit your collection should be embraced as an educational process develop your art taste buds by looking at lots of art and hone your appreciation for the aesthetics learn about the different artists how they have progressed over time for instance and feel your passion grow develop an understanding of the artists a good way to do this is to start with drawings buy posters and postcards and put them on the walls of your home or desk this will train your eye and help you realize the aspects of art you love and those you find forgettable choose the art that s right for you collectors have many different methods for choosing the works they wish to buy a prolific and globally renowned collector like david geffen the very wealthy record label executive often cites the wow factor in other words he buys art which makes him think wow go out and view lots of artworks getting to know what you are like as a collector requires that you do so also museums galleries and auctioneers are making themselves increasingly accessible to collectors so join their mailing lists talk your own language always remember there is no right way to discuss art so don t be shy when you meet connoisseurs also don t worry that you know nothing about art you know what you know and must feel free and confident to talk about it in your own language you don t need to spend a lot of money in terms of money remember that collecting is an evolutionary process look at some of the greatest collections in the world they started with initial purchases or just a few thousand dollars and were then built upwards good art dealers appreciate this and will work with you to build your collection up above all don t rush it is vital that you take your time find a dealer that you can trust this will generally be a dealer who makes themselves available and will work with you to learn and slowly build up your significant collection the best dealers are like counselors and should be worthy of your trust avoid salespeople especially those who sell art as a commodity art collecting revolves around passion and belief relying on saleability as your ultimate goal simply won t work also remember that a dealer who trusts their own choices won t refer to an artwork s price history as their primary justification an artwork s price history on its own is no guarantee of anything and will only give you other people s possibly inaccurate predictions get the price right while price should never be your main driving factor look at the amounts works have been selling for at auctions or at past shows ask your dealer if you can exchange the work in the future or can they can resell it if you later want to buy something else or something better by an artist build a relationship with the auction house it helps to have contacts introduce yourself to the representatives in your field of interest ideally you should know the people at the auction house as well as you know your favorite dealer observe listen learn and ask questions especially if you are there mainly for investment reasons talking to people can be key be prepared to question the artist s dealer or even the artist about the work itself remember a collector should be as passionate about the work as the artist which can require you to be very passionate indeed bear in mind the hidden costs the costs of restoration and framing can be costly and insurance is vital works on paper should be kept away from sunlight if the works are going to be on a wall it needs to be glazed according to museum standards with acid free matting and ultraviolet light resistance glass if the work is more than 10 years old then you should have an art conservator look at it before it is framed also remember that with art you are buying objects that have a life of their own if you maintain and look after your art you may one day be asked to loan them to an artist or museum over the art s lifetime you may find yourself dealing with museums and other institutions as a custodian of the historic artwork rather than simply as an owner avoid the biggest mistake a collector can make not being informed enough otherwise you may buy something that doesn t possess the depth a work of art should evoke or pass on something and later you realize that you should have bought it it is better to take chances but ensure that those chances are born of a genuine passion be warned that if you treat art like a commodity you will end up with stocks or certificates on your wall in other words you will potentially be surrounded by things that you don t like and don t want to live with equip yourself with a knowledge of art history the history of the markets and the current art scene it can also help to become a member of an art dealers association above all ensure that you amass a collection that you will love and can live with potentially for the rest of your life,Arts-and-Entertainment

shipping address because he is on a ship in the north atlantic a scammer may tell you that shipping is not required because he is moving to the philippines using his personal shipping agent a scammer may tell you that shipping to his home address is undesirable because it would ruin a surprise for his wife if a buyer is moving ask for both the old and new addresses even if he does not want you to

which is more common with larger brushes use a jar or tin to store your other brushes than can t be hung up you could also remove the glass and insert a piece of corkboard in the frame instead use nails or pushpins to hang your paintbrushes display your paintbrush holder like you would a piece of art it ll be easy to grab the tool you need while also helping yourself stay organized keep supplies visible and easy to access by storing them in mason jars this can be a really fun way to display things like pens pencils paintbrushes markers crayons scissors pushpins stamps glue sticks and other supplies you can keep the jars on your desk on a shelf or even along the floor against the wall 4 x research source you could also use recycled aluminum cans cover them with decorative tape or colorful paper to make them look nice and use them to store writing instruments paintbrushes and other crafting supplies 5 x research source smaller apothecary jars could be used to attractively store sequins glitter buttons beads and other small supplies 6 x research source if you aren t using the lids to the jars put them somewhere safe so that you can access them if you ever need to mount short pieces of pvc pipe on the wall to display your paints position each piece of pipe so that the opening is horizontal to the ground and your supplies will rest neatly inside for each pipe put a long nail into the wall to hang it from you could arrange the pieces in a honeycomb pattern in a straight line or even in a large circle stack your paints inside so that you can see the bottom of each container and easily find the color you need when you re working on a project 7 x research source you could also use these pipes to store markers yarn and other supplies cut each piece of pipe to the exact length you need depending on the type of supply you re going to use it for a 4 to 5 inches 100 to 130 mm piece of pipe should neatly hold most paints use shallow shelving to display your supplies above a desk supplies can easily get lost in deep shelving or drawers and it can be hard to see what you have to work with line the shelves with jars paints small canvases stamps sponges and other materials 8 x research source if you don t have space above a desk or workstation these shelves can be installed anywhere they add a cool visual element to any room while also being functional organize fabric in a filing cabinet so it s easy to see what you have available it can be hard to keep track of what fabric you have when it s stacked in a pile make it easy to browse by wrapping pieces of fabric around wire hanging files then place those files inside the filing cabinet when you re ready to create you just have to pull open the drawer to view your options 9 x research source if you use a lot of fabric consider investing in a tall filing cabinet so that you can have several drawers dedicated to storage consider organizing your fabric by color so you can easily grab the right shade without having to search for too long use colorful boxes to store your supplies on shelves for a tidy look buy the same size and style of boxes either in the same color or in multiple colors this makes it easy to stack the boxes and helps them look more uniform if you prefer a more eclectic vibe use boxes of various sizes and shapes to keep your craft area cleaned up 10 x research source you could use plastic boxes or for a more upscale look use decorative boxes made of wood or coated cardboard label each box with its contents so it s easy for you to find what you re looking for store small supplies in an apothecary cabinet for an elegant storage solution this is a stylish way to keep your materials neat and organized you can buy a new apothecary cabinet or search for one at antique and vintage stores fill each drawer with supplies keeping them separated by type so they stay organized 11 x research source many apothecary cabinets have places for a small label on each drawer if yours doesn t have that option consider using a small piece of decorative tape or masking tape to label each one since you can t see what s inside this works best for smaller items as larger ones probably won t fit inside the drawers repurpose a mirrored medicine cabinet to hide supplies these types of cabinets don t have to be just for bathrooms hang one in your office or crafting room to add a cool decorative element and use it to store paints jars filled with supplies or other materials 12 x research source most mirrored medicine cabinets are slim enough to fit behind doors it could be a nice way to check out your outfit before leaving the room while also serving as extra storage space transform a closet to be your art storage station take a look at your closet space at home and see if there is a way to consolidate their contents so you can have one closet dedicated entirely to your art supplies you could install shelving on the inside hang a pegboard from the back of the door add totes to hold loose items and implement lots of other storage solutions 13 x research source when you open the closet door it will be wonderful to see all your supplies in one place make sure to label the containers if they aren t opaque so that you can easily find what you need use a door shoe organizer to utilize storage space on the back of a door whether it s the back of a bedroom or office door or the inside of a closet door that area is prime organization space simply hang the organizer from the top of the door then fill each compartment with your various supplies 14 x research source try to keep your supplies separated by type for example keep all your markers in one compartment and all your paintbrushes in another instead of mixing them a door shoe organizer can also be a great option for storing yarn you ll be able to easily see what colors you have available and it ll save tons of space that would normally be taken up by these bulky supplies install a magnetic strip to hold magnetic containers filled with supplies place the magnetic strip along a wall on the underside of a shelf along the side of a desk or workstation or on the back of a door buy small magnetic jars bins or containers to store your supplies and attach them to the strip to keep your surface areas clear of clutter 15 x research source magnetic spice jars can be repurposed for art supplies you could also use a magnetic sheet hung from the wall to hold your supplies rather than a strip just depending on what kind of space you have available add shallow shelves behind a door to store paints thread or other supplies that space behind a door is often neglected but it can be a great storage solution when you re dealing with a lack of space just make sure that the shelves are shallow enough that you can open the door fully without it knocking against them 16 x research source floating shelves may work particularly well and appear less crowded than traditional shelving might look you can buy shelves to install or you could try your hand at making them yourself use a ladder shelf to hold containers filled with your art supplies you can either build a ladder shelf or buy one fill the shelves with boxes jars and other containers so you can easily access your supplies while freeing up floor space 17 x research source going vertical with your storage will use up less space and make your room look less cluttered than a horizontal storage solution would invest in stackable containers to keep supplies neat while saving space plastic containers that have drawers rather than lids may work especially well because you won t have to take out multiple boxes to access whatever you need stack your containers beneath a desk in a closet on shelves or anywhere else they ll fit 18 x research source label the outside of each container so you can easily see what each one holds use decorative tape and a marker so that it s easy to remove and change labels if you need to you can buy differently sized containers to tailor your storage space there are lots of systems that have multiple size options that still allowing each container to stack on the others for example you may want a higher container for bulkier supplies and a shorter container for things like paper or fabric,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to paint with squirt guns,squirt gun painting is a fun and easy art project be sure to select a handful of reliable squirt guns you ll also need to purchase or make your own washable paint finally plan the specific project you re envisioning ahead of time carefully load the squirt guns and fire away,get reliable squirt guns there s nothing that will interrupt the fun quite as quickly as a dud squirt gun accordingly avoid the cheapest squirt guns as they tend to break not to mention leak you don t need to get the fanciest guns on the market but look for options that feel solid to the touch and have triggers that are easy to pull 1 x research source if you do go the dollar store route be sure to get extra in case a few don t work out generic options from large retailers are often just as good a name brand options consider a pump squirt gun depending on the age of your children and the specific activity you have planned squirt guns that fire by way of a pump instead of trigger may be preferable for instance young children may struggle with a trigger but be able to pump a small squirt gun 2 x research source whether trigger or pump powered simple pistol style guns will be sufficient for most projects choose based on the gun s reservoir the reservoir that will hold the liquid paint is important for two reasons first how much paint do you want to equip each child with second the reservoir closure is a good indication of the quality of the gun smaller reservoirs of course will be better for stationary art projects in part because the guns will be lighter and easier for children to aim be sure to check the seal on the reservoir s closure cheap plastic plug closures are unreliable and indicate that the toy is low quality in general that said these may work fine for a one time project or party especially if you get extra default to washable paint whatever the specific type of paint you use and how much you water it down you probably want to choose a washable option this is true even if you re hoping your kids will focus on painting a canvas instead of one another try tempera paint washable tempera paint works especially well it often comes in liquid form already but you can also get it in powdered form to be mixed with water if you get the liquid type mix it with at least equal parts water follow the directions on the packaging of powdered tempera paint and use roughly twice as much water as they call for 3 x research source make your own liquid watercolors you can purchase washable liquid watercolors but they re also very easy to make you ll save money by making your own too simply purchase a small plastic tray of different watercolor paints pop out the colors you want to make into liquid paint and add them to individual containers of water that is just below boiling 4 x research source use as much water as you want the more you use the less bright the color of the paint will be for an art project start with about a half a pint of water for each color store paint in recycled condiment containers plastic condiment containers with a flip top lid and small opening are ideal for storing your liquid paints not only do they facilitate easy dispensing they are also the hardest to spill 5 x research source if you don t use all of the paints store them out of the direct sunlight shake them before their next use provide funnels for filling unless you have storage bottles with nozzles that can fit into the squirt guns reservoirs funnels will be necessary to help fill the guns direct children to take their time while filling their squirt guns and not to overflow the funnel 6 x research source submerge squirt guns that are hard to fill if the hole to the squirt gun s reservoir is especially small there may be trouble filling it in these cases put the paint and liquid mixture into a plastic container that is slightly larger than the gun this will allow users to submerge the gun and allow water to replace the air in the reservoir 7 x research source food storage containers such as tupperware work especially well note that this filling method is more likely to lead to paint all over everyone s hands etc use watercolor paper or canvas panels for paintings for art projects prop a canvas panel on an easel or suspend a piece of watercolor paper from a similar apparatus be sure to do so ahead of time so there s something to shoot at as soon as the kids get their hands on the arsenal 8 x research source experiment with the way you shoot for instance the squirt guns will have a different effect upon the canvas when the shooter is standing closer or further from their work in general shots taken near the canvas will be easier to aim and paint will disperse less before it hits the canvas meanwhile shots from further away will provide a sprayed effect 9 x research source use painter s tape to make shapes on the canvases before painting block off a section of the canvas in whatever shape or pattern you want when the tape is removed the shapes will be preserved within the splashes of color 10 x research source dye t shirts with older kids consider using clothing dye in squirt guns to make custom t shirts or other items with older kids since the dye will be permanent make sure everyone understands that they shouldn t spray one another or anything other than the intended target 11 x research source clothing dye is available in powder and liquid forms at many grocery stores and other large retail stores follow the directions on the dye s packaging allow the paintings to dry once everyone is finished painting carefully take down the canvases and store them horizontally to allow them to dry allowing the works to dry vertically is also an option but be aware that the paint will likely continue to run downwards and may saturate the bottom of the canvas 12 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to use art supplies,people often go to a museum to look upon beautiful pieces of art you may think how did that person do that here s a few ways you could create beautiful art of your own,pick the kind of paint you want to use watercolor paints are painted on watercolor paper and then wet with water and a brush oil paints are painted on canvas or linen acrylic tempera and gouache paints are good for beginners because they are easy to move on the paper and dry quickly pour some of the paint onto a palette you can use a plastic plate but a glass one is recommended because it is easier to clean it s better to mix colours than use paint directly out of the container especially if you don t have access to many colours if you are unsure how to mix colours and what will be the result use a color wheel for help they come in a variety of sizes and are a very useful tool take a paintbrush and paint the picture you want if painting from a photograph it should be your own photo or you will need to get permission from the photographer before using his her work either use a new paint brush or dip it in water when you want to use a new color keep in mind that there are many kinds of paintbrushes and not all brushes are created equal it may help to sketch your painting first commonly used with paintbrushes although for effects used with plastic utensils and scrapers pick the color you want in a specific area hold it like a regular pencil start by coloring lightly with a base color then add lighter and darker colors to show highlight and shadows this will make the object look three dimensional color in opposite directions to hide your pencil lines however don t smear the pencil to hide the lines because it looks very unprofessional as does coloring flat and not mixing colors using complementary colors colors opposite on the color wheel will dull down a color if it is too bright color with the side of the pencil if your filling in a big area the tip if you re coloring a small area it helps to sketch it first sketch your drawing use a light watercolor pencil like a light blue or gray to do this if you use a regular pencil it will show take the watercolor pencil you want to use draw a few lines in the area you are using the color in it is recommended that you use at least two colors together to mix them as with colored pencils use different colors to show highlight and shadows take a wet paintbrush and paint with water over the area the less water you use the darker the color will be sketch your picture hold the marker like a pencil color in the same direction it looks neater if you make one line across instead of making a few smaller ones hold an oil pastel like you would a crayon to make an impressionist picture like the work of monet or seurat repeatedly strike the paper with the oil pastels using a reference picture to figure out which colors to use where the closer together the marks are the more the color will show and colors can be mixed by putting dots of different colors close together art teachers typically say to use at least five different colors for each object in the picture oil pastels can also be used to do something called resistance which is when you outline something and then paint over it and the oil pastel shows up try oil pastels on a canvas paper pad and then use turpentine with a brush to soften them you can manipulate the color and turn it into a soft looking oil painting don t overdo it though or it will turn into a muddy mess less is more lightly sketch what you want to draw using vine charcoal once this is done start adding more detail and shade as you would with pencil however unlike with pencil it is perfectly acceptable to use your hands or blending stumps to move the charcoal around the paper once your picture is done spray it with a fixative otherwise it s going to make a big mess and get ruined draw the image in pencil first outline the pencil with black pen it is recommended that you use an ink bottle and wooden pen with metallic point instead of normal ball point pen because sometimes in order to get thicker lines you might want to use a brush dipped in ink instead of a pen shade the image in there are several methods of doing that the easiest one is getting gray shades is mixing the ink with water however it is recommended that you make different shades of gray using dots just plot random dots where you are going to begin shading depends on virtual point of light or sun dots should be little far apart so you get lighter gray as you move towards the darker side decrease the distance between the dots until you get a solid black color you can also dip the brush in ink and shade darkest sides with it sketch what you want to paint it is recommended to do your sketch with a hard pastel or a pastel pencil draw lightly it is also recommended to use a pastel paper to do your painting on wallis paper is like a very fine sandpaper and the tooth of the paper holds the pastels it gives you rich colors and the ability to manipulate and blend them begin painting with the pastels it is recommended that you use hard pastels first save the soft pastels for the finishing touches like icing on a cake because of the tooth of wallis paper and other papers like it using the hard pastels first will be beneficial and will keep you from using up your expensive soft pastels too quickly the more pastel you put in an area the darker it will be it is also recommended that you wear rubber gloves and do your blending with your gloved finger this to keep from getting sore fingers if you are using wallis paper or a paper like it it s like trying to sand off your fingerprints ouch,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to save money on oil paint supplies,in a rush of enthusiasm many beginner artists spend a fortune on art supplies even amateurs will tend to spend more than they really need to it s important to recognize that your devotion to art doesn t need to be matched with owning every possible piece of art equipment and paint color in stock indeed if anything it s possible that owning everything will stifle your creative outlet as you re confronted by the paradox of too much choice this article will explain how a working person with a mortgage and household bills to pay can manage to satisfactorily balance the enthusiasm for overstocking on oil painting supplies with the realities of what will really get you on your way in this inspiring hobby,acknowledge that you don t need to spend a fortune on a hobby although many books videos and magazines have a tendency to advise you to buy the best equipment possible it s really not necessary to spend a fortune on your supplies when you re learning how to paint temper the desire to buy shiny new things with the reality that it has only been in relatively recent times that artists have had access to such a huge selection of art goodies and that artists throughout time have achieved incredible things without this exceptional amount of choice before them indeed question whether you will simply feel overwhelmed with wondering what to do with it all instead of creatively inspired if your pocketbook can t handle the splurge cease worrying your creativity can handle the budget road to oil painting decide what you re going to paint on there are different media and you ll need to find which ones suit you best through playing around on them over time however you will note that the choices tend to be rather affordable canvas this is the usual medium for painting on and it s available throughout many art craft and hobby stores when regularly using the same art and craft shop don t be afraid to ask for a discount or to find out if they have a regular shopper card ask without any hesitation and you may get 20 percent off everything you buy you could also take a look in the bargain pound or dollar shops which sell an a z of items they sometimes offer a selection of smaller canvases for sale and never overlook a sale or a closing down sale in such stores canvases will often go on sale as part of such wider sales as an alternative to canvas you can oil paint on mdf board plywood masonite or even hardwood purchasing these products from your local diy store will enable you to buy the exact size you need cut specifically to your requirements of course these surfaces need to be prepared correctly so remember to rub down with sandpaper prior to applying the base coat however this is definitely part of the tactile experience of oil painting so look forward to it practice on canvas pad sheets or inexpensive canvas boards before using expensive canvases home gessoed mdf boards are inexpensive but cost a lot of labor canvas boards are great for small studies practice and preliminary paintings canvas pads are sometimes gessoed heavy paper imprinted with a canvas texture better ones are real gessoed canvas and can be put on stretchers later if you like your painting consider learning to stretch your own canvas especially if you want to work on large or unusual sizes learn about base coats many artists use gesso a chalk based white liquid that has been used for centuries by painters however this can be quite expensive unless you re spotting the sales instead you could use acrylic primer undercoat which is available from paint stores it is water based and dries very quickly a typical application would be an average of six coats using sandpaper to rub down in between each coat get oil paints this is the fun part of the oil painting selecting your colours in many tubes but here you can easily go overboard and by colours you like rather than colours you need before you even go crazy have your painting project in mind and stick to the colours that you re actually going to be using a list is budget rule number one for any sort of shopping other helpful ideas include although artist quality oil paint can cost as much as 12 00 a tube due to the purity of the pigments you can buy student s quality oil paint which comes in 38ml tubes and is priced at around 3 00 per tube depending on the colour try rowney brand as it is quite good overall both in pigment and in price making it ideal for hobby purposes it s also good if you want to try it and you re not sure yet whether you ll like it or if you like to paint small and don t expect to cover large areas if you really enjoy painting often and want to experiment with different effects purchase the artist grade paint in your most used colors and work with a smaller palette the simplest palette would be lemon yellow permanent rose or alizarin crimson and ultramarine with a larger tube of titanium white and a tube of burnt sienna for building skin tones as a base used as a thinner thinned value painting first layer and as a darkener for yellow orange and red colors that you don t want to turn too blue then in order to get the most out of the artist grade paint buy extra linseed oil squeeze out a very little bit of paint and thin it down with linseed oil until it s as thin as the student paint it will cover a lot more area and give more versatile textures use the artist s linseed oil though the salad oils are not pure enough for painting some frugal decisions don t work very well get painting butter or impasto medium if you like using it thick with a palette knife instead of using up the whole expensive tube artist grade is cost effective if you need to cover more area and it makes techniques easier as you discover what colors get used up fastest purchase those in larger tubes and use the smallest size the paint comes in for colors you use less of for most subjects ultramarine and burnt sienna get used up very fast while yellow and red though used often don t get used up as fast obviously this will vary with your style and favorite subjects a painter who likes sunflowers more than landscapes may use up lots of yellow red and yellow ochre but relatively little ultramarine cadmium hues are the same color as expensive cadmium paints but less opaque if you don t care about them being opaque even in artist grade the cadmium hues will be among the cheap pigments and real cadmiums more expensive when you need a color like bright yellow or blue that isn t too greenish look for whether there are more or less expensive versions watch in general for pigments in the low cost series range pigments rather than mediums or binders are what costs more in artist grade keep your paint supplies in top condition to help them last longer and go further clean the threads on paint tubes after using them use thinner to get off any clumps of dried paint clean out the caps on older tubes that have stuck if a cap breaks immediately contact the manufacturer to try to get a replacement cap they may even replace the tube cap the tube with something that will seal it completely from the air like a couple of layers of plastic wrap held on with twist wire or rubber bands just keep the tube airtight until you can get a replacement cap save extra caps from empty tubes in case one cracks wash them out completely so old paint doesn t mix in with a different color purchase an inexpensive device called a tube roller you can squeeze out the last bits of paint from old tubes this way if a tube dries out and you can t get through the plug in the opening poke through that thickened paint with an awl and use the tube roller to press the still soft paint out from beyond the plug the plugs happen when the tubes aren t sealed properly if a tube cracks it will start to dry out inside the tube until it s unusable notice when this happens and do what you can to use it up while it s still soft sealing that hole in some way may save the tube or use the tube roller to roll the tube up past the crack and then seal it so that you don t lose that expensive half tube of paint worst case squeeze it all out and put it in the freezer in your palette with a kitchen plastic cover and use it up within the next couple of weeks whatever that color is choose a subject for your next painting that uses that color over a large area if it was a red or yellow think about doing a sunset with reflecting water if it was a blue think of doing a twilight scene where everything s tinted with blue or a monochrome blue portrait it s better to use it than lose it empty tubes are sold for artists who like to grind their own pigments to make their own oil paint these are another solution for cracked and broken oil paint tubes if you get a set of them you can transfer the paint into a fresh tube squeeze it out fill the new tube with it and then crimp the end using the tool that came with the set of empty tubes choose your brushes there is very little difference between the cheap and expensive brushes for the amateur painter so buy mid priced or student brushes there is no need for dozens of them you can complete a painting with around six brushes one of which should be a fan brush used to soften the edges of the painting get the palette you are most comfortable with available in various shapes and sizes such as oblong round and kidney shaped and in numerous materials plastic wood etc the kidney shaped palettes do look very arty though they are cumbersome and heavy when using regularly cleaning and scraping palettes is time consuming so if you would rather spend your valuable time painting why not use disposable plastic or paper plates normally used at parties the white background helps you to see the exact colour being mixed and there is no mess you just thrown them away when you have finished with them grey is an even better color if you can get paper plates in grey you can see your values easier in light colors on grey if you use a palette on the table instead of holding it in your hand what the thumb hole type of palette is for then a plain piece of glass with white or grey paper under it makes a good palette grey paper shows the exact colour and value of the mixture get a good thinner at 3 00 for a small bottle pure artist turpentine made from pine trees is widely available in art shops you can use this mainly to clean brushes and not in fact to thin paint for mixing with paint use odorless mineral spirits or odorless substitutes like winsor newton sansodor turpenoid etc to avoid using too much thinner go ahead and spend the money for a double dipper medium and oil container that clips on your palette seal the cups after painting so that any unused thinner doesn t evaporate a one time expense will save your wasting expensive odorless thinner and artist grade oils to clean your brush using a minimum of thinner use a rag or paper towel to squeeze most of the unwanted paint out of it dip the brush into the thinner cup and don t swish it around lift it out and scrub with the rag again repeat several times and it s clean while you still have lots of thinner in the cup consider not cleaning your brush until you re done with the painting small traces of previous colors will mix with the color you re using to harmonize color throughout the painting this is especially useful if you re using a small palette very few colors because they ll all have a trace of the other colors don t throw away the palette mud the mixtures left over after you ve painted scrape them together with a palette knife cover with clear plastic kitchen wrap then put the palette in your freezer warm it up again and you can paint once more the neutral mixture is a good base for many elements in a painting it can be tinted more toward one or the other colors with fresh paint and still used paint daily at least a small painting again this is a good use for left over paint when you re done get a good medium instead of using very thick paint for texture strokes and impasto get a thickening medium like an impasto medium or painting butter to extend artist grade paint which is concentrated try using the absolutely brilliant medium liquin original which is bought in appropriate quantities from art shops it helps the paint to dry more quickly and at the same time provides a great glaze get the best or at least plenty of extras cheap or free a little time spent combing the places where people offload their unwanted hobby supplies can pay enormous dividends for building up your oil painting supplies here are some savvy finds check craigslist ebay and other auction and swap sites as well as car boot trunk sales for bundles of supplies when someone else has given up oil painting it happens frequently you can get quite expensive supplies used at boot used wares sales or auction sites in a bundle this is also a good way to try artist grade paint and determine if it s worth it given your styles and habits if you use a lot of paint snap up various lots and keep using what comes up as you discover how different brands behave most or all of them are compatible with each other watch for clearance sales at art shops art shops that are closing and especially sales after the holidays or before they start coming out with the new holiday catalogue very often expensive student or artist gift sets with lots of supplies are bundled together cheaper in the gift set starters sometimes with a lovely wooden box to carry it all in it was already a good cost effective bundle when it first came out but when it s discontinued in favor of the latest gift sets it s a steal some of the wooden box sets are well designed to use for painting outdoors too online art supply companies like jackson s in the uk or dick blick in the usa can often have regular prices at a steep discount from what they are in brick and mortar shops for those of you living outside the usa sometimes the biggest us art suppliers are cost effective even with international shipping small and lightweight items may be more likely to come out worth the shipping cost get your easel locally but your most expensive paint tubes from those suppliers it s also possible to split a large order and get extra savings by putting together a group order with other hobbyists to take advantage of a 10 to 20 big order discount someone has to collect the money place the order and have the rest over to pick up their stuff but it can save quite a lot recycle and reuse if you don t like a painting you ve done gesso over it and do a new painting it s a tradition as old as art itself let your turpentine settle in a jar until the sludge settles out then when it s mostly clean pour off most of it into a clean jar where it can be used for cleaning again if you don t like a painting you did on gessoed mdf it s important to gesso both sides anyway so it won t bend so add a bit more gesso to the clean unused side sand it smooth again gesso again paint on the back or do this even if you like the first painting so that you ve got an interesting double sided painting to frame just on the edges and hang or mount somewhere people can see both sides ratty old brushes that are splayed out sometimes make good texture brushes and don t need to be thrown out just use them differently you never know what new painting style you might discover when recycling drives your method be aware that these are just a few ways you can keep the cost of your art hobby to a minimum whilst fully enjoying your painting experience no doubt you ll discover more ways to trim down the budget and still achieve all that you want out of your oil painting hobby,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to be an organized artist,artists can be notoriously messy but it isn t because they are lazy or dirty they re just too creative to deal with the squareness of staying organized but an organized artist is a more effective one able to spend more time working and less time searching for paint cleaning off the workstation or figuring out how to effectively sell their work,keep related supplies in the same area if you re a photographer keep all the necessary lens cords and batteries organized in the same quadrant of your home or studio paints should be kept with brushes cleaner and canvas print supplies should be by the ink etc make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier limiting your search to a much smaller area some ideas include essential supplies area the things you use every day inspiration and reference area dedicated work area infrequent or secondary supplies area tucked out of the way 1 x research source make an effort to clean a dedicated workspace after every session this doesn t mean cleaning the entire studio it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk easel pottery wheel etc clean each night discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately without having to do any work or tidying even if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art place loose supplies in large clearly visible containers as visual people a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight by using jars old glasses vases and cheap clear plastic drawers you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly some ideas beyond those just mentioned include canvas shoe racks on the back of the door wine racks with cups in each slot to hold pens pencils plastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint pigment etc 2 x research source use clotheslines and clips to hang sketches photos and reference material simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you don t want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape cheap and easy this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration 3 x research source use every inch of the room for storage especially vertical space shelving is an artist s best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space don t be afraid to get up high either especially for infrequently used supplies the upper reaches of the room are often the most under utilized but provide vital space for all your tools and materials 4 x research source use chalkboard paint to make space for drafting ideas right on the walls turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas sketches and planning without requiring extra equipment or space you can even use it for smaller areas paint over jars or storage equipment allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change purchase a label maker to make your organization strategy semi permanent a lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently this usually has the opposite effect leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things you can just follow the labels freeing your mind to think about art 5 x research source make a habit of throwing out old excess or useless stuff each month once a month do a purge of your studio if it isn t essential or part of a project either throw it out or file it away for later artists are constantly making new things experimenting and making a mess this is a good thing but only if you set aside time to declutter it may not be fun at the moment but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch don t be sentimental here if you haven t used it in the last six months there is little chance you ll use it in the next six months toss it keep your reference materials sketches articles photos etc in one easy to find place as you start planning for a project or work you ll likely be gathering scraps of inspiration and test sketches while everyone has a strategy there is nothing more maddening than digging through a book or the internet to re find the cool idea you saw three months ago try out dedicating 1 notebook preferably with insert folders to each project making a bookmark folder for each project on your internet browser to easily compile online inspiration tacking up physical inspiration on a wall or cork board near your workspace 6 x research source make studies or practice sketches to organize effectively for larger projects very few artists simply dive right into large projects almost 100 of the time they instead work on related smaller projects called studies to prepare for the larger work you might practice the face of the portrait you re making sketch our different composition ideas or practice a vulnerable or difficult part of a sculpture keep these organized as a way to prepare both the skills ideas and supplies needed for the final project limit the supplies you leave out to the project at hand at the end of the day artists are visual people and tucking everything away neatly and cleanly may not be conducive to the artistic process of course neither is losing or misplacing essential supplies find a compromise by packing away any supplies not currently in use and leaving a little bit of essential clutter it s okay to have inspiration scattered around the studio just make sure it s the inspiration you need for the current project just because you aren t organized is no excuse not to make an attempt don t feel like the only options are perfect cleanliness or an utter mess there is a middle ground keep an updated list of all of the necessary supplies and the quantities of each nothing is worse than spending a long night on a painting only to realize you ve run out of white paint halfway through a section once a week or more frequently if possible check in on the quantities of your supplies so that you can refill them before it becomes a problem a simple spreadsheet or notebook marked at the end of each artistic session is a quick and easy way to keep tabs on your stuff break down bigger works into more easily completed parts deciding to paint a mural is a huge undertaking but sketching the idea transposing the image onto the wall painting the basic colors then adding shading detail are four separate and more manageable projects organization is key to big projects even if it feels constraining to your creativity in reality organizing your work and progress frees your mind to actually be creative instead of worrying about logistics figure out the building blocks of each part of the project tackling each at once don t jump around across all parts of the project haphazardly keep all of your past work organized and accessible when you finish a project whether it sells or not don t just stuff it away in a drawer you never know when you ll want to revisit and idea or more excitingly when interest in your current work will drive up interest in past projects if you do electronic work back it up every 3 6 months on a dedicated hard drive there is nothing worse than an accident destroying all of your old projects 7 x research source record all of your artistic contacts and connections in one place more than many industries successful artists need to cultivate a diverse network of other artists curators instructors and gallery assistants to be successful you never know when someone will hit it big and provide a helping hand or when you ll have some work you want to place in a friend s art show don t leave meetings and connections up to chance organize and compile your contact information in once place for later make notes of phone number email location role in the art world how you met or connected 8 x research source log the costs of supplies needed for each project if you re looking to make a living off art you need to treat certain aspects of the process like a business this however does not need to interfere with your creative process simply holding on to your receipts and writing them down in one sheet is a great first step towards financial security and autonomy you can often write off almost all of these receipts on your taxes as they are private business expenses keeping expenses organized isn t just about time it is about saving money 9 x research source find out how much it costs you to make and sell each piece if you re making the same or similar pieces each day you can figure out how much each piece costs you to make them by dividing the cost in supplies by the number of pieces made so if 10 wood sculptures cost you 100 each sculpture cost you 10 to make 100 10 10 this may seem trivial but you need to have a complete picture of your finances if you hope to make money off your work at the very least ensure that you are not losing money on each piece pay attention to what other similar works of art are selling for if you want an organized productive artistic practice you need to know about the trends around your work keeping organized is about more than just your own studio it is about understanding the art market you re a part of peruse etsy visit galleries and show openings and follow art blogs and news to keep abreast of the latest developments and prices consider the cost of your time when pricing work while it doesn t have a dollar value make sure you value your time as well as your materials in the earlier example don t forget that it cost more than just 10 to make the sculpture your hours of work and experience are essential too so don t sell the piece for 20 if it took you a week to make while pricing your work is difficult don t balk at the high prices you see other artists selling for not everyone can do what you do and people are paying for your talent and experience at the very least consider what you d be paid if you used your time otherwise twenty hours spent painting could be worth 15 an hour at another job you should consider this missed money when pricing work if you want to make art your living you need to price the work high enough to take care of yourself careful financial organization is essential to pulling this off,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to put together equipment for watercolour painting,watercolour painting is a fabulously rewarding hobby and is an especially enjoyable way to start out when you first become interested in painting before you embark on your newfound artistic endeavours it is important to make sure that you have a good set of appropriate equipment for watercolour painting this article will help the beginner watercolour artist to choose the appropriate items when starting out,obtain a field box or palette to begin with you can use a portable lightweight field box it should be small and sturdy easy to travel around with you buy it empty and fill it up with your own choice of colours it makes a good investment and if you change your mind about the colours that you have bought it is easy enough to change them alternately watch for artist grade field box sets on clearance or deep discount sales if the color range has two yellows two reds two blues a gold color like yellow ochre a reddish brown and a dark brown then the set will give you the basic colors you need one or two greens in it may be useful white is body color that may be useful for adding light details on dark areas if you want to change the colors later half pans of pan watercolor are all the same size so you can pull out a color you don t use much and replace it with a new one you ve learned to love sometimes a set with a good field box is cost effective even if it s more than getting the same colors in a simple box if it s well designed and has extra features like a water bottle snap in travel brush folding palette sections watch for those on sale and if you re not fond of the paints feel free to swap in half pans of good paint in other brands full pans are larger and take the space of two half pans in a watercolor box you can also refill empty half pans from tubes of watercolor paint if you change the color or brand be sure to rinse out the remnants of the old paint before adding more fill it let it dry and see the surface sink then add more till it s filled up by pouring if it s the same brand you can add more before it s completely empty if you live in a very hot and dry climate the best option would be to purchase tube colour paints or if you re fond of using paint strong direct from the tube some painters prefer using tube paints for their consistency use tube watercolour paints on a plastic lightweight palette it s easy to hold and not too heavy these palettes are also good if you prefer bringing more colors out into the field they have many small slants to hold paint and large mixing areas in the middle once open at home a large palette with a cover may be convenient porcelain palettes are expensive in large sizes but also come in smaller forms like the traditional seven well flower palette porcelain has the advantage that it never stains weighs more and is less likely to get knocked off the table plastic is lightweight covered palettes may let you keep paint moist rather than letting it dry out completely though most watercolors will reactivate if you put water on the dried blob and let it soak for an hour the bigger boxes are more suitable for indoors as they are too bulky to cart around with you on field trips this depends on your transportation your setup and the weight of the box judge how compact the box is and its weight when full against how far you ll walk carrying it before you settle down to paint a tin with 48 half pans might be quite small compared to a large metal palette with forty or more slants in it purchase a good quality brush you need one good brush spend a bit of money on getting good quality buy a few more if you can afford it but you don t need a huge selection of brushes if you can afford it kolinsky sable brushes are lifetime brushes when properly cared for if not consider looking for top quality synthetic or synthetic sable blends you may replace good synthetics more often but they can be just as good for a year or two for your brush look for one that has a wide belly so that it will hold and carry plenty of colour and that also comes to a fine point you can make a handy holder for your brushes out of a bamboo mat this allows you to roll up the brushes and tie them together for ease of carrying purchase water soluble graphite pencils these are very useful for a watercolor artist ensure that you also get a propelling pencil one that has a reasonably soft lead buy some sketchbooks you can never have too many sketchbooks in different shapes and sizes but whatever the size the best type is spiral bound as these are easier to use outdoors you can open them out flat and they come in different sizes and different qualities of paper heavier paper will take colour well so that you are able to experiment with your paints look for multi media journals that have sizing on the pages to accept water they allow more big washes and more freedom in your watercolor sketching than drawing paper choose good watercolor paper watercolor paper comes in sheets pads or blocks each of these forms have different advantages 100 rag watercolor paper is best although some good mixed papers can also be effective get the best paper that you can afford because good paper will respond better to your early efforts many beginners get discouraged when cheap materials don t give good results full sheets can be cut to half sheet or quarter sheet size for large finished paintings suitable for your portfolio or framing and placing in galleries they allow you to work large and are sometimes less expensive though buying by mail order or online you may need to buy a minimum number of five or ten sheets the disadvantage of loose sheets is that they need to be stretched soaked in water then taped or stapled to dry out on a drawing board that s wood or gatorboard this is a lot of physical work for a beginner but useful to know stretching watercolor paper also removes some of the sizing and makes it more absorbent you should also get some watercolour paper in pad form spiral bound with loose sheets which you can remove once you ve done your work this is handy and convenient but presents a problem you might notice in some sketch books too large wash areas and using a lot of water on it may make it cockle and bubble up irregularly sometimes it won t even dry flat one way to help reduce this problem is to sketch out a picture area smaller than the size of the pad by an inch or two on all sides so there s dry paper around the wet area to help flatten it another is to weight down the edges of the paper while it s drying by stacking books on it watercolor blocks are extremely convenient especially for working outdoors they re bound like a pad on all four sides with a little inch on one side left unbound with all four edges gummed down tight they may bubble up but will dry completely flat look at the weight of the paper it will say 90 pound 140 pound 300 pound or even 400 pound this is the weight of a stack of 500 sheets of a certain really big size not how much your pad weighs 90lb paper is very light common in student papers and multi media sketchbooks it s not suited to very heavy washes unless you leave plenty of space to the edges and you may have to flatten it afterward but it s fine for watercolor sketching 140lb watercolor paper is a good standard weight quite thick heavier than cardstock and will usually flatten out again even if it cockles 300lb paper and heavier is almost like cardboard and has a different feel it s useful for some types of paintings because it can be very absorbent and you almost don t need a backing board for it choose the surface of your watercolor paper hot press is very smooth like computer paper it s good for illustrations and styles where you may use fine line pen drawing with watercolor effects it s hard to get broken color or dry brush effects on hot press cold press is standard and it s what most inexpensive pads are it has a medium texture that gives some broken color and texture interest but the peaks and valleys aren t so large that you can t work small rough watercolor paper has very large texture patches big dips and peaks in the surface it s good for working large creating texture effects and doing various other special effects techniques each of these textures has its own best techniques and its own look when painted so test them and discover what suits your style or whether you like choosing the paper to fit a specific painting watercolor boards are another possible surface they re either paper bonded to an archival board or a special water absorbent gesso formula applied to mdf or archival boards they have the advantage they don t need stretching and will not cockle at all watercolor ground can be applied to different surfaces to create a surface you can use watercolors on this can be useful if you want to put a painting on the cover of your hardcover sketchbook or something assemble together various miscellaneous items there is no need to spend a fortune on these extra items keep it simple a bottle of water and a collapsible pot for outdoors use two pots of water one clean for adding water to washes and wetting your brush one dirty for cleaning brushes some artists use three so that as the clean one gets dirty there s a second clean one to rely on at home these water pots can just be jelly or peanut butter jars cups short fat drinking glasses anything handy some artists find some of their favorite water containers at yard sales indoors you may find a brush washer system useful it s a plastic square or rectangular water bucket with two or three compartments one will have angled notches where you can rest your brush with the hairs under the water but not actually leaning on the hairs the other side has ridges to scrub your brush against to clean off thick paint these are useful for watercolor and acrylics for oil paints the brush washer systems are different it s similar to the two jar system but has some perks to make brush washing easier set out a mixing dish or palette the plastic palettes for use with tube paints have mixing areas and so do field boxes at home though you can supplement these or just use a cheap ceramic or glass plate plastic plates can also work but these may become stained a lot easier than ceramic glass or corelle extra cups for mixing large washes like sky color are useful choose a clear cup or one with a white interior so you can accurately judge the strength of the wash for pouring effects you may need several of these yard sales are a good choice watercolor easel folding table or drawing board each has its advantages a watercolor easel is designed so that it can tilt completely flat or at any angle this allows an experienced painter to let paint deliberately run or colors poured into earlier washes to move in the direction you want a table is just convenient outdoors field easels are usually lightweight and can double for holding other types of painting equipment outdoors indoors a multifunctional easel that can lay flat will serve for watercolors as well as oils acrylics and pastels or just work on a table indoors if you use a drawing board with stretched paper you can put it at a slant to let water run by stacking books under the high end and prop something heavy in front of it so it won t slide off watercolor easels work very well with watercolor blocks the lightweight outdoor ones are cheaper so the budget minded could just use the outdoor easel at home and tuck it away in the closet when you re done,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to protect your painting supplies with the all in one paint bucket,here is the appropriate set up to provide instant protection for paint roller and paintbrush a double utility sprouts out the arrangement for it also provides for instant start with easy access to the paint reserve fresh water is saved on every use precious time is saved on every use all in one one hand carries all is easy fast and safe for it disencumbers the floor from all too many booby trap objects the stress managing scattered drying tools consequently dissolves no washing required is pain out of the paint for every painter sink and sewer,prior to work with the all in one arrangement remove all the traditional painting tools from the working area removal includes the paint tray the paint tray trolley the paint can the can lid the screwdriver to open the hammer to close etc keep working area clear free from all objects this will help performance when painting and upgrade the all around safety factor shift heavy furniture to one side forecasting opposite shifting at execution mid point if you are working outside to impose yourself the same discipline is good practice preferably on a workbench in the workshop display all equipment paint tools including the all in one arrangement bucket the table in the kitchen or the picnic table will do the same for security matters it is best to keep the room area to be painted totally clear and free from all unnecessary object concentrating on one task at a time highly contributes to remove stress fatigue this is the road of the easiest execution and for the finest results no stress no mess unseal the all in one arrangement bucket hinged lid and flip it open the front part is easy to flip while the rear part stands sturdier with the container the inside of the lid provides a hook for the paintbrush the bucket inside shows a composed horizontal vertical rolling surface serving also to support the roller the holes in the rolling surface are made for roller traction also returning excess paint to the container for continuous mixing paint effect preventing separation of the paint there is full access for brush roller to reach the paint in the bottom the arrangement makes for quick move and no spill compared as with the traditional paint tray install the paintbrush inside the lid there is a clip inside the lid provided for the paintbrush grab the lid with one hand four fingers outside while pushing the spring clip inside with the thumb this easily opens the spring clip so you may put the paintbrush handle between the clip s two jaws then release pressure from the thumb and the paintbrush will hold solid inside the lid whenever you need the paintbrush it will be readily available in a second this way you will stop experiencing the lost paintbrush syndrome and repetitive solid dry old timers understand what i mean paintbrush can be clipped into place whenever clean dry wet or fully paint loaded and instant ready anytime to resume install the paint roller onto the support inside just deposit the sleeve part of the roller onto the inside rolling surface and then deposit the handle on the rear support this way the roller will always be available within a second anytime the paint roller drops onto place may it be clean dry wet or fully paint loaded and kept instant ready to paint open the paint can you have already chosen at the paint store poor the paint into the new bucket this is the hard part because if you ever experienced some kind of discomfort when dropping the first paint into a new and clean traditional paint tray well this could give you an even stronger scary discomfort feeling don t worry it is for the better pleasure will come accordingly ten time folds and even stronger with the new set up close the lid now most important is all done you have reached the set up final point you may feel to start painting right away do it or later maybe it is now fully up to you and in no time with no paint lost no paint dry skin no tools dry out or paint tray dry out you may have a coffee break or even come back next day or next week and always at no extra time cost or material lost you are now paint time master always ready to paint or to stop with instant paint tools protection do not throw the paint can to the garbage you may need it later consider seriously this step if you are to work a great deal on a ladder or stepladder the bucket with ladder hooks is strongly recommended maximum one gallon paint capacity it hooks in the outside part of the ladder respecting painter s body safety space entirely inside paint bucket arrangement set up is similar as explained above and same preparation is recommended from step 1 to step 6 allowing the safe traveling up and down the ladder with one hand for load one hand for safety hold and to be open when ready to paint at the appropriate level the arrangement can stay hooked unattended in the ladder for a minute or for a month and be always ready provided it is not cooking under the sun closing the lid takes a second simple basic logic tells that the painter must not hold a paint can or tray in one hand while concentrating with the other with a paintbrush or a roller it is only more evident in the ladder where the free hand shall be used for safety purpose working with good safety habits always comes to big pay someday always use the extra hand for holding safe a painter can imitate a clown but not a bird without damage only after you are sure you will never need that paint again there seems to be two ways to go one is just as good as the next but for sure do not throw the paint away to garbage neither to a reseller put the left over paint back into the original paint can and seal it for your own further use wash the tools using the bucket as a sink for soaking second best way is to leave all the left over paint in the bucket with all the tools paint loaded and always instant ready give it to the neighbor and make a new friend if not already this way there will be more than one happy people and we go for a better world this is the path to saving some more fresh water sink sewer river and paint too thank you calculate the increased performance count how many steps you eliminate not traveling in stairways or ladders because all tools are at hand always multiply the saved time by your hourly rate evaluate and compare with the tradition way this exercise will convince you about the quick and reliable pay back of the arrangement the instant protection is 1sec for all paint tools traditional runs ou 10min 600sec 600 times fold compare bolt is 27 mph 43 km h versus ferrari is 337 mph 542 km h less than 12 times fold,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to use an art journal,an art journal is basically a diary anyone can make an art journal the only difference is how you use it you can use it like a diary every day like a comic book of your life things that happened to you or just do sketches of interesting or memorable moments from your day or week,choose a journal or sketchbook or make one you can get an inexpensive notebook and just concentrate on the content of the book or a fancier blank book if you re more serious check out the stationery department of your favorite store or an art shop don t get anything too fancy if you re just beginning drawing too fancy is anything that makes you feel guilty about writing in it or worry that you might mess up and ruin the journal on the other hand if you prefer to draw or paint choose a paper quality texture and thickness that are suitable for your preferred medium there are pocket journals for when inspiration hits or for when something happens and you must draw it right away choose the paper size you prefer there are suitable books of normal size paper poster size and miniature size check whether the book you choose will stay open by itself it s no fun to try to draw or write when the book is flopping closed under you some people prefer spiral bound sketchbooks because they lay flat others dislike them because the spiral gets in the way when they draw this is completely a personal preference thing so choose what works best for you notice what s involved in getting a page out of your chosen book especially if you think you might ever want to take a work out and display it make the journal your own at the very least lay claim to it by writing your name phone number is good too in case you misplace it in it or on it you could also decorate the cover recover it add color or attach interesting objects to it start putting stuff in it don t spend too long worrying about exactly what to do just start doodling or doing whatever s on your mind you may find that some of your best work happens almost accidentally leave the first page blank if you re not sure you can draw well enough yet or if you d like to make an index as you go if you do the first page last your art skills will have improved by the finish and you ll give it a gorgeous introduction choose a middle or back page and chart your paints pens and other art supplies one function of an art journal is to learn what your supplies can do starting at the back with color charts and mixing tests makes them easy to find for reference later try new techniques in your journal feel free to try out techniques you see in art videos online articles and magazines that s part of the fun of having an art journal write down your thoughts about the experiment this will make the page a mini article about what happens if you mingle poured watercolors or if you use glitter glue instead of putting down glue and shaking glitter over it these texts about the process are fun to read and the next time you want to use those materials you can look for inspiration right in your journal think of something that happened during your day which made you happy or angry one of the main points of an art journal is to vent emotions and opinions in a healthy way you can put down things that happened in your life you can t talk about things that make you laugh sketches of funny outfits you saw anything really treat it like a real diary if you want or simply use it to collect your works and practice the whole point is that the journal is for you by you and its contents are completely up to you try reflecting on other art and design you see especially if it makes an impression on you or grabs your attention you can draw or create your impression or just write about it create in your journal frequently it s good practice if you re learning new techniques or perfecting old ones and it helps to keep you in that frame of mind turn off the filters and the inner critic don t hesitate to experiment in it or make mistakes this is your journal put in it what you want if that s strictly drawings fine if that s a mixture of drawings paintings writing collage and pasted in prints of your favorite photographs that s fine too doodle aimlessly on a few pages or try out a new medium or technique your artistic journey might not even happen all in one book put your ideas on paper as soon as they form or as soon as you can perhaps you made what you thought was a funny joke during school or at work but no one laughed you can draw that many different ways you can draw it like a comic book complete with the joke and the awkward silence where no one laughed just one picture with the punchline that didn t work or you can split the page into halves or fourths with the key points of what happened it doesn t matter so long as you create your impression of it review your older entries occasionally you might find new inspiration in old pieces things to try drawing again or varying or simply memories you may also see a pattern of your work progressing through different interests and moods or of your techniques evolving and improving,Arts-and-Entertainment

that keyword to your list 10 x research source prune your findings go through your images once more be extra picky here remove any images that don t match your theme exactly aren t good quality or don t look nice with the other images keep the nice high quality images that do work together how you delete them depends on how you saved them image saving website bookmarks file folder etc don t delete the images completely as you organize your board you may find that they may work after all plug your images onto a digital canvas if you saved all of your images onto a digital board such as pinterest or polyvore you are all set alternatively you create a website for your board using google sites blogger tumblr etc and insert your images there you can also open up a blank canvas in an image editing program and copy paste your findings onto the document if you work in photoshop or similar paste the images into different layers so that you can move them about if you saved your images onto your

how to become a better artist,being an artist includes continuously evolving your skills improving your technique and pushing yourself beyond the next boundary it s part of your growth as an artist and can even see you changing your artistic techniques completely several times during a lifetime becoming a better artist is a journey and will bring greater satisfaction to you as you continue to build on what you already know,buy all of the necessary supplies drawing pencils erasers sketchbook pastels paint an easel whatever you think you will need for your area of expertise new supplies and mediums can be encouraging try beginner sets of artist grade supplies because they are often easier to use than the cheaper student grade supplies 1 x research source begin with an inexpensive sketchbook with lots of pages and a sketching set that includes kneaded putty eraser and different grades of graphite pencils it may also include charcoal pencils charcoal sticks graphite sticks and brown gray or reddish sketching sticks all these tools are useful and the supplies are cheaper in bundled sets than bought individually h and 2h 4h etc are hard pencils that sharpen to a fine point and give a very light mark easily covered by paint or inking they re for design f is a fine pencil a little harder than an hb which is a normal no 2 pencil and middle hardness b means black and each successive degree of b pencil is softer blacker and smudgier 2b is a good sketch pencil 4b is a great one that gives good shading and 6b or higher is almost like using charcoal for ease of smudging and shading 2 x research source purchase some how to drawing books this includes books on specific subjects like how to draw animals how to draw horses how to draw seascapes etc whatever you like most or get interested in try to accomplish at least one drawing a day you can even frame them and put them up on your walls to inspire you to keep going through the next day you can also check out drawing books from your local library and find out which one inspires you the most before buying it work through each of the exercises in turn rather than trying to do everything in the book at once date your daily sketches they don t need to be complex or difficult a five minute gesture sketch is as useful for learning to draw as a half hour spent doing a detailed drawing if you have a half hour spending it on half a dozen shorter sketches will actually give better practice try to get it right but don t worry about perfection you ll achieve good recognizable drawings by constant practice more than anything else 3 x research source choose a favorite subject this might be your favorite animal a favorite flower a rock a bottle with light coming through it anything you would really like to draw well and care about personally draw the same thing over and over many times in many different ways repeated drawing of the same subject or type of subject each of your cats your cat from several different photos your cat s paw one day your cat s nose the next will give you a much richer grasp of the anatomy and proportions of that subject when you ve drawn your pet cat enough times it becomes easy to sketch a tiger on the first try draw enough pebbles and a mountain becomes easy and understandable sketch and draw anything you see it could be the homeless dude begging for change or the little girl skipping around with a balloon in her hand whatever you see that looks interesting draw or sketch it 4 x research source still life is one of the easiest subjects for beginners to draw literally the objects don t move choose simple ones at first a vase without too many curlicues a few pebbles a flower without too many petals a clear bottle with an interesting shape etc draw each of the objects separately as a study then start arranging them together in different ways to see how they go together the big advantage to still life is that your models don t move and if you do it indoors the light from your lamps doesn t change with the time of day either animal drawing may be your passion start with your pets start when they re sleeping even if that doesn t seem like an exciting pose it s when the animal s more likely to hold still long enough to be drawn use photos of your pets visit zoos with a camera and snap photos of every animal you see and like then work from your own photos look for open source photos like wikipedia commons and other photos where the photographer gives permission to draw from them you can also contact photographers who take good animal photos and post them on flickr or facebook asking permission to draw from their photos many will be happy to give permission and most will want to see your drawings when you re used to drawing animals fast from life try drawing at the zoo or wildlife like the birds at your feeder life drawing of animals is a good way to learn to do quick gestures and detail them later buildings and architecture study perspective as it s important in buildings more than anything else to make them look real find a good book on perspective and do all the exercises be careful about working from photos because they will sometimes distort vertical lines and alter perspective you may have to correct the photo once you understand what you re doing this is another popular fine art subject that never loses its appeal like still life you can go out and draw buildings in person without your model getting up to walk away 5 x research source landscapes are a traditional fine art subject sketch your own yard from life often sometimes a small beautiful area sometimes trying for the big panoramic view go out on camping trips or visit local parks with your sketchbook in hand do several quick five minute or less gesture sketches to get the main elements of your landscape design down just rough outlines then pick the best small thumbnail and draw that view larger this saves a host of troubles over starting with the details of a leaf and only finishing one branch of that tree in an hour details are actually easier than doing the big shapes of things landscape drawing is about textures shapes and light that changes quickly so learn to draw fast get the shapes of shadows down first thing because the angle of the light will change in half an hour and so will the shape of the shadows people are a popular subject for drawing start with the friends and family members you can convince to sit still for a half hour or more to let you draw them paint the ones you love sketch anyone who interests you again practice quick small gesture drawings in public so that you can get the gist of a figure or a face within a few minutes before the person wanders off or does something else sketching in public is also a great ice breaker a good way to meet people because someone often wanders up to see what you re drawing you have a topic to talk about right away art one that most people like and one that isn t controversial look into art lessons of some sort most places offer community classes where you can sign up to take some art lessons just know that you will have to invest a bit of money but it certainly will help look for art lessons online and art videos or dvds many professional artists create instructional dvds in various mediums or on drawing in general websites with forums like http www wetcanvas com will often have free art lessons with volunteer teachers who give assignments critique your work and help in encouraging ways sites like http how to draw and paint com may have a lot of free instruction available and downloadable e books as well as further instruction for sale try before you buy with online art lessons some are as good or better than in person art instruction you should like the teacher s art and also enjoy the teacher s style of presentation to get the most out of an online class 6 x research source subscribe to art instruction magazines the artist s magazine pastel journal watercolor artist american artist and others all have excellent articles on how to draw and paint the more you read the more you ll understand the many technical terms and different techniques there are to drawing and painting learning art is cumulative it may seem easy because people who do something well for a long time do it easily but it s a complex field of study that takes time and effort to master patience practice and study are what really constitutes talent talent is loving the process so much that you re willing to put up with your mistakes in order to learn how to do it so well others call you talented this usually comes at the point they can recognize what you drew for what it is learn composition and design look for books on design and composition take classes in design study it as much as you do how to draw things accurately it makes the difference between whether you create great art or just copies of photos learn how to crop reference photos choose which subjects to shoot or sketch in a landscape guide a viewer s attention in the painting to the most important thing in it a portrait s eyes the sunlit patch in a landscape that you chose as a focal point the animal bending to drink the people on the beach some subjects are attention getters by themselves like a cute kitten but you can improve on that cute kitten picture to the point it s irresistible if you learn good design principles and give just the right balance of background space around it 7 x research source get a job if you are old enough it could be at a craft store like joanne s or michael s or you could be an intern at some sort of design studio get to know a gallery owner and volunteer to help with setting up shows and you may eventually be hired to work at the gallery alternately sell your art online at ebay or etsy sell portraits or pet portraits or landscapes in person off the easel bring your portfolio to galleries sell at art fairs or science fiction or media conventions 8 x research source what type of art you do will affect where it sells best and whether you re ready to make a living at art yet the point at which good art supplies pay for themselves comes very fast whenever you master at least one popular subject that non artists like your work this can be cartoon cats dragons cute manga animals or cute manga kids as easily as a fine art subject someone will offer to buy something sell it give them that joy even if you know you could have done it better the connection they have with your drawing is real and emotional your technical criticism has more to do with your growth as an artist and less to do with the external value of your art you re often its poorest judge don t undersell yourself to make a living in art learn how to become self employed there are many aspects to self employment that have nothing to do with how well you draw and paint everything to do with how well you manage your money and time if you prefer to set your own schedule make all your own business and financial decisions work well without supervision plan schedule and complete major projects without any outside authority the life of a full time self employed artist may be right for you if it s not then enjoy having a side income and look for a related job where you have an employer a steady check benefits and someone else responsible for all the business stuff how much you need to earn to be happy in life is a lifestyle choice if you have your health you may not need a high income to be happy as a full time artist if you have dependents or health issues it may not be practical to go full time until you can earn a professional level income pursue your career part time till it matches your job income 9 x research

how to be good at art,art is part craft part creativity and part business to become a better artist you need to both connect yourself to experts who can teach you advanced techniques develop an original style and figure out how to make the money necessary to support your art if you want to become a professional artist if you just want to be good at art in school particularly primary school there s less need to think business and advanced techniques once you get started hopefully your art will become progressively better as your talents earn you the resources that will allow you to improve yourself further,find your art form it is important to find a type of art that you enjoy this can mean trying a few different varieties settling on the one you love best consider drawing painting in oils painting in watercolors drawing with charcoal sculpting making installations and wood carving be open to experimenting with different styles of art you might find that a trip to the art store will make your choice for you certain art media are more expensive than others consider starting off with something like drawing which does not require expensive materials and then moving on to other forms of art once you have the skills and resources to support them 1 x research source you might also find that as your skills evolve you will move on to more complicated forms of art after you develop the ability to replicate shapes in drawing you might want to introduce colors and move on to painting 2 x research source go to the art store it s hard to be a good artist without the right gear think about the basics first to keep it affordable to allow you to experiment once you re happy with the art form you ve chosen start to expand your art kit and add more advanced items until you have a decent amount of tools at your disposal 3 x research source if you can t afford the items look online for locals selling their art equipment find a teacher go to art shows or look online for local artists once you find one who you like talk to her him about lessons remember you don t need to rediscover all of the artistic techniques that have been developed over the past two thousand years there are people who can teach you these methods 4 x research source professional feedback can also be very helpful for your development learning from your mistakes is vital and usually requires someone else who can see your work objectively go to school usually art school is the best way to master your craft but if you re having trouble getting into a good art school or don t believe that a four year degree fits your schedule there are other options most community colleges offer art class that you can take individually these are usually cheap and can even help you develop the skills to get into a better school 5 x research source fear not although art school can be a great way to improve your skills there are few fields where your degree matters less than in art ultimately you will be judged on the basis of what you produce 6 x research source never stop reading there is always room to learn new techniques and styles while the internet has some of these resources you will find the most comprehensive treatment of these subjects in full length books start with the art books that you can find in your local library and then look online for the best reviewed books practice if you don t practice you won t get better you should make practice a habit allot a specific amount of time per day to practicing even better allot a specific period in the day to practice don t be afraid to challenge yourself and try new things when you practice try things that you know that you can t do you can learn a lot more by grappling with things you don t know than by repeating things you re already good at don t worry about how good what you re doing is the only way to learn new things is to experiment 7 x research source try a master study a master study a type of practice wherein you take a great work of art and replicate it it probably won t be perfect but you will be learning from the best 8 x research source give yourself time to improve give yourself plenty of time to improve and test the direction your art is taking this means being patient and giving yourself time to stand back and obtain a bigger perspective of where you re headed most importantly keep at it personal style takes time to develop don t expect it to be innate it is like the sculptor chiseling away at the rock what you re capable of can take years to be revealed be strange vanderbilt psychologists have found that people who are a bit weird are more creative 9 x research source art that is unique generally sells better than art that simply shows a high level of skill having a distinctive style of living is often part of an artists trademark in other words bucking norms might help you become a more original artist and even if it doesn t it certainly makes for better marketing 10 x research source get out of here art is about recreating personal experience in an original way 11 x research source in order to do that you need to have experience doing something other than looking at a computer screen get out of the house and go see the world a walk through nature like a walk through woods or along the beach is thought to increase creativity these sort of walks allow us time to be alone with our thoughts and introduce us to experiences that we don t encounter in our everyday life 12 x research source travelling to another country can introduce you to a new culture and unfamiliar experiences a lot of studies have indicated that spending time abroad can improve creativity even thinking back to a time when you were out of the country can cause a temporary burst of creativity 13 x research source be aware of your influences it is common for great works of art to pull on the work of other artists it is also however easy to replicate other people s work without realizing it a particularly impressive image can be engraved in your memory so that you unconsciously recreate it while searching for something new expose yourself to a lot of influences and when you create something ask yourself how if it too closely resembles the work of someone else be prepared to change your style over time keep things fresh and be prepared to pursue new paths as you grow as an artist even if you have developed a signature style you might find that it gets old with time experimentation does not necessarily mean giving up what you have done before just developing a wider repertoire consider the value of a career art isn t necessarily about money but it is a lot easier to devote the time to developing your craft when you don t have to work a full time job at the same time think of the money you earn from art as liberating you to pursue what you love a career can cascade as you earn the money to support yourself you can spend more time developing skill and a reputation as an artist 14 x research source advertise you should build a portfolio of your own work and then do everything you can so that other people find and purchase it today that is normally done online post your work on social media and build a website that features your best images 15 x research source if you want to be old fashioned find a coffee shop that looks like it needs some extra decoration bring your portfolio and show the owner your work ask if she would be willing to put it on display and refer interested customers to you she will get a better the ambience out of the deal and you will get to advertise your work network subscribe to local art papers and be aware of art shows festivals or seminars when you attend events be yourself and be sociable try to meet people who could connect you to clients or galleries where you can sell you work perfect an elevator speech the principle of the elevator speech is that you can give it to someone on a short elevator ride and by the end they be interested in exchanging information with you in a few sentences you should be able to tell someone what makes your work interesting if it doesn t seem to work keep on revising it until you find something that grabs people bring a lot of business cards so that when you meet people who are interested in you work you can easily share your contact information include a website that features your work on the business card keep track of all of the business cards you receive and set up appointments to meet with people after the event 16 x research source join a community of artists become known in your art community as a supportive person with a genuine interest in the progress of your fellow artists when you make comments be constructive not destructive help people to learn through guidance and constructive feedback use this community to get feedback on your work and meet potential clients don t be jealous of other people if you develop a reputation of helping out other artists they in turn will help you 17 x research source consider forming a collective to pool your resources you can rent out a space to display your art or even share the expenses of a studio collectively in the end you won t just be saving money you ll be introducing one another to new customers 18 x research source hustle ultimately most artists don t make ends meet by doing just one thing they have multiple sources of revenue so that when one disappears backup jobs are still on the table sell works online put others in galleries look for public art contracts apply for grants and teach not only is this a good way to make ends meet you ll also learn about what the most lucrative business models are 19 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to determine if a painting is an original or reproduction,if you are buying a painting for your own enjoyment buy what you like and what feels reasonable but buying a work of art as an investment is very different it is not so much the art as who painted it and the provenance the proof of the artist s actual connection to the piece,do your homework research the piece know the artist s work look at many of his pieces compare signatures get close ups of the signature increasing your knowledge is critical to examining the piece and knowing what to look for when judging authenticity visit museums study the patinas if you ask to see the back of a painting the staff may show you examine the feel and look of old art works study the depth and number of layers of paint needed to achieve the color desired by the artist 1 x research source look at the front and back of the piece 2 x research source examine the patina of the piece itself dirt and dust of the ages texture the brightness of colors or lack thereof study the canvas do a thread count modern or old is there some patina on the back surface of the canvas look for anachronisms if the canvas is stapled on the back of a 1800 s piece of art something is wrong look at the patina of the wood to determine whether the wood is old determine how the frame is put together considering what kind of nails and hanger are used 3 x research source look for bristles painted copies sometimes will have hairs from the cheap paint brush still in the paint on the canvas 4 x research source use your nose when you do get your hands on the painting smell it it takes oil a while to dry and years to completely lose the smell of oil 5 x research source decide about how the piece feels to you balance everything many fakes for example have no depth of paint layers it s easy to copy a piece electronically but a photo copier cannot get the layers of paint a real piece has 6 x research source check for consistency a fake painted copy needs everything else to match frame wise and a patina is hard to reproduce get the work appraised if it is something you are in love with you need a third party to independently review it someone who is not in love how do you know if the appraiser is reliable he or she should have a certificate from one or more of the professional associations of art appraisers have a history of work with the particular artist or medium or period and preferably not be a dealer or broker of art himself one example is bernard ewell who is an expert in salvador dali whose prints are often copied research the market history of the artist what have other works of this artist sold for at other auction houses this size time frame and same medium 7 x research source note that some dealers perhaps including those on cruise ships may attempt to confuse the buyer with sizes and periods even mediums to sell a lesser piece at inflated prices look for signature and number for prints they must be signed and numbered signed in stone is of little interest because unlimited copies can be drawn 8 x research source research the gallery many pieces will have gallery stickers or information written on the back research that gallery to learn whether it is look for signs of wear there should be some signs of wear on the frame even the canvas sometimes wooden edges not quite as sharp after 50 100 years and drier research the artist for reputation know that some artists are known to have signed blank paper which later have prints drawn on from them which means the artist did not even supervise the pulls these would be of significantly lesser value salvador dali was know to have done this beware of a scam where the print is not numbered but another document is which is meaningless as any signed in stone can be used in place of the real item 9 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to talk about art,talking about art can be intimidating especially if you are not knowledgeable about the artist or the work of art you don t have to be an expert to look at experience and talk about art in fact art will often have a different impact on different people in order to talk about art learn appropriate terminology discuss the content of the image and assess how you feel about the image you can also spend time looking at the piece and reading up on the image and artist this will provide you with more information to discuss,talk about the materials used a variety of different materials can be used to make art and each of these materials will create a different visual effect for example sculptors can use stone marble wire or wood to create their art similarly painters can use watercolours oil chalk and pencil when you are looking at art comment on the materials or medium used to create the image if you can t identify them look at the label 1 x research source identify the style of art in order to sound knowledgeable while discussing art learn to identify the style of art for example some common and recognizable styles include abstract realist expressionist surrealist or impressionist a piece of art that uses realism can be easily identified because the artist attempts to create an image that looks real almost like a photograph 2 x research source alternatively an abstract piece of art does not attempt to mimic reality and instead can include random splatters of paint or lines to create a thought provoking image familiarize yourself with the different styles by searching online for images of the different styles of art for example search for impressionist images visit museums which often group art by style you may find yourself in a room of surrealist paintings for instance consider the content the style of art can also be described by looking at the content of the image for example learn the differences between portraits image of a person landscapes image of a place or still life image of an object works of art 3 x research source familiarize yourself with common descriptive terms it is also a good idea to know some descriptive words that you can use while describing art you can use them to describe the mood of the painting as you perceive it dynamic intimate suggestive challenging check the time period of the piece you may have heard of renaissance art modern art or cubism before these are a few different time periods and movements within art history to talk about a work of art check its time period consider how the historic moment impacted the way that art was created consider the movements that were happening at that time for example cubism was a type of modern art that was developed in the early twentieth century artists such as picasso departed from the romantic and realistic artwork of the late nineteenth century and began creating more abstract images 4 x research source think about any major world events such as war that may be reflected in the piece consider what was taboo at the time and place the art was made works that may not seem shocking now might have been then or vice versa talk about the composition and placement composition refers to the ways in which objects or shapes are arranged within a work of art for instance shapes may be placed near each other overlapping spaced apart or arranged in a pattern this influences the order in which you observe parts of the painting 5 x research source one way to notice things about the composition is to see where your eyes go naturally when you look at the painting for example you could say i m seeing that the artist has painted bright lights around the figure of the baby it makes it really hard to look away from that corner of the painting 6 x research source comment on the lines and brush strokes in some paintings you will be able to clearly see the brushstrokes and technique on the canvas you can comment on the way the brush strokes catch your eye and give texture to the image at other times paintings can look smooth almost like a photograph in this case the artist is likely going for a real life effect 7 x research source you could say this piece looks just like a photograph how does the artist create such smooth lines alternately you may notice really thick brushstrokes or blobs of paint you can comment on the sculptural thickness of layered paint notice the colors and contrast colour is another important element in art and can be used to capture your attention colours can create a contrast between light and dark or complement each other in a visually stimulating way when talking about art discuss how the color makes you feel and what you think it communicates 8 x research source for instance you could say the light and dark contrast in this image makes a sharp distinction between good and evil in this piece you can comment on the feeling of the painting that the color communicates this bright piercing blue invokes so much joy yet the muted red tones of the background feel more like a warning avoid delivering unnecessary judgements art is very personal and it is not always meant to make you feel good as a result you may offend people by giving harsh criticism instead you can comment on the art itself without saying whether or not you like it this allows you to comment on the work without giving your personal feelings avoid saying things like i could make that this type of comment is insulting to the artist and does not promote artistic conversation if you do dislike a piece you can explain that it s due to your personal taste for instance you can say i can see this is well composed i have trouble looking at this image though because it s so dynamic it almost feels violent ask questions a great way to assess a piece of art is by asking questions if you re going to talk about art questions are a great way to learn from your companions and promote conversation ask if your companion knows much about the artist or the art movement in question get the opinion of your companion about a piece acknowledge that you are not an expert if you are visiting an art gallery with a group of friends or colleagues and you do not know much about the kind of art you re viewing feel free to admit to confusion at any point some people in your group may actually be relieved to discover that they are not the only person outside of their comfort zone 9 x research source pretending to know a lot will be awkward and isn t necessary you might say wow i can tell a lot is going on here but i don t know where to start talk about how the art makes you feel the most important thing when you are thinking and talking about art is that it makes you feel something even if that feeling is unpleasant comment on how the piece makes you feel and why sometimes the artist will intentionally want the audience to feel uncomfortable this does not mean you need to judge the quality of work just the impression that the piece has left on you 10 x research source for example you may feel inspired sad happy confused uncomfortable angry etc take a long look at the piece of art most people only glance at a piece of art for example a survey done at the louvre found that the average person spends 15 seconds looking at the mona lisa this is not enough time to truly engage with a work of art try to spend at least a minute preferably longer looking at a piece of art this will allow you to take in the image look at the detail of the composition and determine how you feel about the piece by spending time looking at art you will more likely be able to talk about the piece and some of the finer details 11 x research source if you are able to stare at a work of art for long periods of time you may begin to create a dialogue with the piece this can be extremely interesting as you begin to see how the picture speaks to you read the title and description of the piece art galleries and museums will often place a small plaque near each piece to give the title and a small description this can sometimes provide you with details to help you interpret and discuss the art for example you may see a knot of light pink lines and feel confused upon reading the plaque you learn that the title of the work is my struggle with breast cancer the title of this piece may help you better understand what is being communicated through the art plaques can also include detailed information about the materials used date that it was created etc read up on the artist some galleries will also provide detailed information about the artists this material may be found in a pamphlet or in a small biography near the artwork learning about the artist may help you understand a bit about their interests and what inspired them to create this art this will give you more to discuss about the art,Arts-and-Entertainment

and this can give you a window into their unique perspective in contrast powerful institutions and people throughout history often commissioned artists to create pieces that endorsed their agendas this affects the intended audience of the art piece who was meant to see the art 1 x research source for example pablo picasso s guernica 1937 was created in response to the bombings during the

artist might have made certain choices for example painters in the egyptian school of art had certain rules that they had to follow like the size of any figure they drew was supposed to vary based on the social status of the person they were painting they also couldn t use more than six colors and each color symbolized a different aspect of life or death impressionism one of the largest 19th

14 x research source recognize the artist s effort to convey lines for visual works notice the artist s ability to create confident lines lines are created when an artist draws or paints marks on a page when a sculptor bends or shapes material or when a photographer angles their camera a certain way some ways to describe lines are dashed bold rough smooth or implied 15 x research source pay attention to the shapes that stand out in the painting note any interesting shapes that grab your eye when you look at a piece of art and think about how the artist achieved them shapes can be geometric or organic geometric shapes are simple commonly recognized shapes like squares or rectangles organic shapes are unique and free form looking at still life paintings of fruit is a great way to understand how artists have experimented with shape 16 x research source notice how the artist uses color ask yourself why the artist chose to use the combination of colors that they did and if these colors work in harmony or contrast color has an enormous effect on how we feel when we look at a piece for example pieces with blue undertones are known to have a calming effect on the viewer meanwhile yellow is associated with light and feelings of optimism 17 x research source study the brushwork of a painted piece brushwork or the way that the artist applied paint using their brush really sticks out when you are looking at paintings in person it s used to create certain effects in the art contributing to both texture and mood for example the feathery light brushwork in impressionist paintings is intended to mimic the qualities of light harsh and erratic brush strokes can communicate a sense of tension and anxiety in a piece 18 x research source keep an open mind you will never know if you like or don t like certain types of art if you don t try to enjoy them you can think of going to see new kinds of art as exposing yourself to new experiences rather than just seeing art 19 x research source evaluate how a work of art makes you feel be in touch with your own emotions as you view art do you feel excited calm anxious confused art can evoke a wide range of emotional responses so do your best to be conscious of yours offer your own interpretation of what the art means part of the fun of viewing art is that you get to come up with your own story about it art is very subjective so even if your interpretation of a piece isn t exactly what the artist intended it s okay there is often not just one right answer what s important is that you make a genuine effort to extract meaning from their work 20 x research source because every person has a different set of unique experiences it s valid for every person who views a piece of art to walk away with a different understanding of it this can lead to interesting discussions ask the person next to you what they think 21 x research source it s also completely fine to offer no interpretation at all and instead just enjoy the art for its physical properties 22 x research source applaud the ambiguity of abstraction abstract art art that doesn t look like anything in the real world can be a little harder to appreciate because the message or emotion that the artist is trying to convey is not always immediately clear to enjoy abstract art think about what grabs your eye first in the piece and why the artist might have wanted your attention to go there abstract art can be fun because it s like a puzzle you really have to give it some thought to come up with a potential meaning for it remember your meaning doesn t have to be necessarily correct learn what you like and don t like as you view more and more art you will start to develop an understanding of what you like and dislike in a piece of art this can help you seek out similar artists you don t have to love everything that you see artist statements or descriptive brochures can sometimes be misleading so if you unexpectedly don t like a certain type of art that s fine 23 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to annotate art,art annotations for gcse examinations or other situations might seem difficult but the pattern for writing them is actually pretty clear begin by examining the formal elements of design that comprise the work if you are annotating your own artwork follow up with a discussion of your creative process if you are annotating another artist s work spend some time discussing the context of the piece and its subject matter or message in either case you ll want to close with some evaluation of the work s strengths and a consideration of how the piece might have been created differently,make notes about the use of line line is one of the most foundational elements so a reflection on it is a great place to start you could consider things like 1 x research source what kind of marking techniques were used for example are the lines smooth or scratchy are there a range of thick and thin lines or are they generally the same thickness do the lines recall another artist s style jot down your thoughts on the use of tone when annotating art tone refers to the piece s use of lights darks and shading as you observe the piece you are working with notice the way it creates highlights dark areas and shades in between 2 x research source is the piece predominantly light dark or somewhere in the middle are there any highlights or dark areas that serve as a focal point in the work are there gentle gradients of tone or sharp shifts from light to dark describe the forms used in the work you can look to see if there are any regular forms in the work like squares or triangles make note whether these are pure geometric forms or only suggestions of them like a house may suggest a square shape a work might also contain organic freeform shapes if so describe them as best you can asking questions like 3 x research source are the forms rounded or angular are they solid or broken up are the forms flat or do they have depth list the colors used examine the full range of colors used in the artwork try to categorize them for instance are they mostly primary colors red yellow blue or a set of complementary colors like red and green or blue and orange you can also ask 4 x research source is the piece is monochromatic only uses one color in various shades are warm colors yellow orange and red or cool colors blue green purple prominent does the work make use of earth tones describe the textures you see artworks have real textures or the way the work itself feels such as the smoothness of a polished stone sculpture or the roughness of an oil painting a work can also have represented textures for instance the way a painting might depict the softness of fabric either way describe them 5 x research source are they smooth rough or both do the textures recall natural or manmade objects are the textures related to the subject matter in any way look for a pattern within the work pattern could mean a repeated arrangement of colors shapes lines textures or other elements if there is a pattern it might be obvious as in a floral print or checkerboard the pattern might also be more subtle like the way a piece could alternate between areas of red and areas of blue 6 x research source describe the overall composition how are the elements in the image or work arranged is the work more or less flat or do you see a foreground middleground and background are objects in the image close together or far apart is the work balanced or are important elements mostly to one side or the other 7 x research source put your thoughts together whether you are annotating your own work or a piece by another artist you ll want to write something about the formal elements of the work once you have gathered your thoughts on line form pattern and the other elements put together a solid paragraph or two discussing how these are used in the artwork summarize what you have made no annotation to your artwork would be complete without a reflection on what you have created start by writing a brief description of the piece itself including its medium basic subject matter and style for instance you might write my piece title constellation 3 is an oil painting on masonite board with embedded nails it depicts an angel in a night sky i rendered the work using a rough impasto painting technique and a cool color palette tell the story of your artistic process for annotations how you made the work matters as much as what you made spend some time describing the process you used step by step this can be a simple narrative of the work s development 8 x research source i started by laying black gesso over the masonite panel i drove nails through the panel at random intervals to create texture i then blocked out the subject s basic form using a light wash of thinned paint finally i built up the subject s form through successive layers of thick paint mention any sources of inspiration in creating your work you might have had other artworks or artists in mind or you might have been responding to something from culture like a movie historical event or performance make sure to give a brief statement that explains how you incorporated these points of reference you can also mention if the piece is related to other artworks you ve made for instance you might have been working on a series of paintings depicting night sky scenes acknowledge what you learned from making the piece annotations are often used as part of art education even if you are writing them for yourself taking a moment to think about what you learned from the piece can help you become more self aware as an artist 9 x research source for instance perhaps you learned intricate details about how oil paint of various thicknesses dries at different rates evaluate your work being able to honestly and accurately critique your own work is as valuable as evaluating the work of others when annotating your artwork you can ask yourself a couple simple questions what have i done well in this work try to list a few specific points what could i improve if i did the work over again here too list some specifics write it all out after you ve thought about how you developed your work your sources of inspiration and what you learned form the piece devote another couple of paragraphs in your annotation to these reflections for instance you can have one paragraph that describes your process and inspiration and another that evaluates your work and discusses what you learned or how you would create the piece differently if you were to do it over again if you are writing about your own work you can stop here make sure to proofread your annotation carefully correcting any spelling or grammar mistakes and polishing the style of your sentences to make sure they are clear and flow well give some background information when annotating other artists work you ll want to consider its context what is the work s title who created it what do you know about the artist s biography or the history of this work 10 x research source describe the work draw on your knowledge of the elements of art to write an account of the work itself describe its medium and overall composition as well as things like its use of color line texture and form 11 x research source state the artwork s meaning in your own words what is the subject or theme of the work is if focused on the depiction of an object or individual does a tell a story or is the work more abstract consider for a moment what the artist seems to be saying in the work and summarize it as a message 12 x research source you could also mention here whether the work seems to relate to something from culture or history or to reference other artworks evaluate the artwork mention which aspects of the work seem to be most successful then ask yourself what you would have done differently had you created the work you can also mention what you would ask the artist about the work if you were able to 13 x research source write your thoughts out if you are annotating the work of another artist instead of reflecting on your own creative process you ll devote a couple of paragraphs to an analysis of the piece you re studying for instance you could begin with a paragraph that describes the artist s background and the work itself you could then follow with a paragraph that gives your interpretation of the work s meaning and evaluates its strengths and how you might have approached the work differently after you have the annotations written out make sure to proofread for spelling and grammar polish your sentences stylistically as well so that your writing sounds clear and lively,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to get started as an artist,artists may use many mediums to express themselves and with practice perseverance and talent art can be anything from a passionate hobby to a lucrative career,practice with various mediums art is created with an almost limitless variety of mediums from oil paints to clay from stone to electricity here are a few popular media used by artists pencils and paper drawing is a fundamental art form probably first practiced with a piece of charcoal or some colored clay on a cave wall it is now a refined technique using a variety of paper and pencils pen and ink pen and ink is another form of drawing using heavy rag paper or scratch board and usually a nib pen and ink it can be used to create dramatic contrasts and exquisite detail pastels pastel sticks are pigment mixed with very little binder and rolled to form sticks that resemble colored chalks only the cheapest student grade ones are dyed chalk they can be used for drawing or painting on pastel paper heavy sketch paper watercolor paper or sanded pastel papers oil pastels these sticks resemble crayons and range from very inexpensive children s oil pastels to artist grade oil pastels made with expensive pigments much more opaque than crayons they work on paper boards wood canvas metal or almost any surface watercolors oils and acrylic paints these are vastly different media grouped together only because they are familiar to most people and are all used in what we know as painting ceramics this media is clay which can be hand shaped formed in a mold thrown on a potter s wheel or sculpted by other means sculpting with stone this is a challenging and physically demanding technique modern technology has created tools for removing stone to form a shape but traditionally it is done with a hammer and chisels photography a technique which is constantly in a state of change with new technologies emerging continuously from digital cameras and editing to special effects filters and lighting carving usually done with chisels and knives this is a traditional art form that has also benefited from technology with the emergence of die grinding tools for shaping saws and shapers to duplicate images and remove large amounts of wood quickly and glues and resins for refitting or laminating the work piece as it is worked there are many other media and simply too many techniques to cover them all in one article experiment with the above techniques and materials or others to see which is more enjoyable and productive to you as an individual look at classes offered in your area or even online many school districts offer art classes for students from elementary school through high school often these are elective courses beyond elementary school level and if you are interested in art try to work your school schedule to take all the art classes possible community colleges and universities sometime offer adult education classes in many art techniques check for studio classes or private art teachers if no classes are available where you live in former times almost all artists began as apprentices to masters those who had completed their own apprenticeships and were tradesmen in their craft now some artists will offer apprenticeships to talented individuals who learn from their teacher as they do other studio work as payment practice your medium keep a record or a portfolio of your work whether it is in a sketchbook an album or with photographs of sculptures or carvings this will enable you to see improvements and establish a personal technique work with your talents and skills when you have opportunity if you have talent and develop skill as a painter or in drawing you may get a chance to do some commission work making posters or signs for neighborhood businesses or events watch for contests or art shows which feature the medium you work in shopping malls community organizations and other groups often sponsor juried showings of work and invite members of the community to display and sometimes sell their work this will be an opportunity to share ideas with other artists and to see public reaction to your own work don t be disappointed when every project is not a success this is especially true of sculpture or ceramic projects which may literally fall apart in during the creative process look for inspiration everywhere you go be very observing and pay attention to the whole world around you from the trees in your local park to how their golden leaves glow in the natural light the world is full of shapes textures images colors and forms and many of what are regarded as masterpieces were created using a simple not beautiful subject and the talent of a dedicated artist,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to be an organized artist,artists can be notoriously messy but it isn t because they are lazy or dirty they re just too creative to deal with the squareness of staying organized but an organized artist is a more effective one able to spend more time working and less time searching for paint cleaning off the workstation or figuring out how to effectively sell their work,keep related supplies in the same area if you re a photographer keep all the necessary lens cords and batteries organized in the same quadrant of your home or studio paints should be kept with brushes cleaner and canvas print supplies should be by the ink etc make broader groups and areas for your supplies to make finding them easier limiting your search to a much smaller area some ideas include essential supplies area the things you use every day inspiration and reference area dedicated work area infrequent or secondary supplies area tucked out of the way 1 x research source make an effort to clean a dedicated workspace after every session this doesn t mean cleaning the entire studio it just means keeping the area immediately around the desk easel pottery wheel etc clean each night discard trash or unnecessary materials and wipe down dirty surfaces endeavor to leave the workspace in a way that you can sit down the next day and start working immediately without having to do any work or tidying even if the rest of your studio is a bit disorganized an organized workspace will help you get down to business every time you want to make art place loose supplies in large clearly visible containers as visual people a lot of artist clutter comes from a desire to keep track of supplies visually instead of tucked out of sight by using jars old glasses vases and cheap clear plastic drawers you can keep things in sight without leaving it strewn about haphazardly some ideas beyond those just mentioned include canvas shoe racks on the back of the door wine racks with cups in each slot to hold pens pencils plastic restaurant squirt bottles for paint pigment etc 2 x research source use clotheslines and clips to hang sketches photos and reference material simply string up the wires across a wall or along the ceiling and use them to hold essential papers that you don t want to cut or ruin with tacks or tape cheap and easy this is also a good way to handle papers and ideas you touch regularly or need to pin up and down for inspiration 3 x research source use every inch of the room for storage especially vertical space shelving is an artist s best friend and is a cheap and easy way to get more room in your studio or art space don t be afraid to get up high either especially for infrequently used supplies the upper reaches of the room are often the most under utilized but provide vital space for all your tools and materials 4 x research source use chalkboard paint to make space for drafting ideas right on the walls turning one wall into a chalkboard gives you a perfect space for ideas sketches and planning without requiring extra equipment or space you can even use it for smaller areas paint over jars or storage equipment allowing you to relabel them with chalk as your needs change purchase a label maker to make your organization strategy semi permanent a lot of disorganization comes when you keep moving the location of things trying to optimize your space by reorganizing frequently this usually has the opposite effect leading to lost items and uncertainty when cleaning but an afternoon with a label maker can solve everything instead of spending all of your mental energy looking for or storing things you can just follow the labels freeing your mind to think about art 5 x research source make a habit of throwing out old excess or useless stuff each month once a month do a purge of your studio if it isn t essential or part of a project either throw it out or file it away for later artists are constantly making new things experimenting and making a mess this is a good thing but only if you set aside time to declutter it may not be fun at the moment but it is a lot more fun than spending 30 minutes digging through junk to find the right paint or an old sketch don t be sentimental here if you haven t used it in the last six months there is little chance you ll use it in the next six months toss it keep your reference materials sketches articles photos etc in one easy to find place as you start planning for a project or work you ll likely be gathering scraps of inspiration and test sketches while everyone has a strategy there is nothing more maddening than digging through a book or the internet to re find the cool idea you saw three months ago try out dedicating 1 notebook preferably with insert folders to each project making a bookmark folder for each project on your internet browser to easily compile online inspiration tacking up physical inspiration on a wall or cork board near your workspace 6 x research source make studies or practice sketches to organize effectively for larger projects very few artists simply dive right into large projects almost 100 of the time they instead work on related smaller projects called studies to prepare for the larger work you might practice the face of the portrait you re making sketch our different composition ideas or practice a vulnerable or difficult part of a sculpture keep these organized as a way to prepare both the skills ideas and supplies needed for the final project limit the supplies you leave out to the project at hand at the end of the day artists are visual people and tucking everything away neatly and cleanly may not be conducive to the artistic process of course neither is losing or misplacing essential supplies find a compromise by packing away any supplies not currently in use and leaving a little bit of essential clutter it s okay to have inspiration scattered around the studio just make sure it s the inspiration you need for the current project just because you aren t organized is no excuse not to make an attempt don t feel like the only options are perfect cleanliness or an utter mess there is a middle ground keep an updated list of all of the necessary supplies and the quantities of each nothing is worse than spending a long night on a painting only to realize you ve run out of white paint halfway through a section once a week or more frequently if possible check in on the quantities of your supplies so that you can refill them before it becomes a problem a simple spreadsheet or notebook marked at the end of each artistic session is a quick and easy way to keep tabs on your stuff break down bigger works into more easily completed parts deciding to paint a mural is a huge undertaking but sketching the idea transposing the image onto the wall painting the basic colors then adding shading detail are four separate and more manageable projects organization is key to big projects even if it feels constraining to your creativity in reality organizing your work and progress frees your mind to actually be creative instead of worrying about logistics figure out the building blocks of each part of the project tackling each at once don t jump around across all parts of the project haphazardly keep all of your past work organized and accessible when you finish a project whether it sells or not don t just stuff it away in a drawer you never know when you ll want to revisit and idea or more excitingly when interest in your current work will drive up interest in past projects if you do electronic work back it up every 3 6 months on a dedicated hard drive there is nothing worse than an accident destroying all of your old projects 7 x research source record all of your artistic contacts and connections in one place more than many industries successful artists need to cultivate a diverse network of other artists curators instructors and gallery assistants to be successful you never know when someone will hit it big and provide a helping hand or when you ll have some work you want to place in a friend s art show don t leave meetings and connections up to chance organize and compile your contact information in once place for later make notes of phone number email location role in the art world how you met or connected 8 x research source log the costs of supplies needed for each project if you re looking to make a living off art you need to treat certain aspects of the process like a business this however does not need to interfere with your creative process simply holding on to your receipts and writing them down in one sheet is a great first step towards financial security and autonomy you can often write off almost all of these receipts on your taxes as they are private business expenses keeping expenses organized isn t just about time it is about saving money 9 x research source find out how much it costs you to make and sell each piece if you re making the same or similar pieces each day you can figure out how much each piece costs you to make them by dividing the cost in supplies by the number of pieces made so if 10 wood sculptures cost you 100 each sculpture cost you 10 to make 100 10 10 this may seem trivial but you need to have a complete picture of your finances if you hope to make money off your work at the very least ensure that you are not losing money on each piece pay attention to what other similar works of art are selling for if you want an organized productive artistic practice you need to know about the trends around your work keeping organized is about more than just your own studio it is about understanding the art market you re a part of peruse etsy visit galleries and show openings and follow art blogs and news to keep abreast of the latest developments and prices consider the cost of your time when pricing work while it doesn t have a dollar value make sure you value your time as well as your materials in the earlier example don t forget that it cost more than just 10 to make the sculpture your hours of work and experience are essential too so don t sell the piece for 20 if it took you a week to make while pricing your work is difficult don t balk at the high prices you see other artists selling for not everyone can do what you do and people are paying for your talent and experience at the very least consider what you d be paid if you used your time otherwise twenty hours spent painting could be worth 15 an hour at another job you should consider this missed money when pricing work if you want to make art your living you need to price the work high enough to take care of yourself careful financial organization is essential to pulling this off,Arts-and-Entertainment

current work showing what you are creating right now is important 4 x research source show your application to your art teacher show them your cover letter portfolio and any other pieces of the application besides your grades they will be able to help you craft your materials for the specific school you are applying to furthermore they will offer you guidance on which pieces of art you should and shouldn t include in your application find recommendation writers you will need between 1 and 3 recommendation writers for art schools you will want to ask your art teacher s to write these if you have multiple that is great if you only have 1 art teacher find recommendation writers who can speak about your performance as a student the best way to do this is to think about classes you have gotten especially high grades in with a teacher who likes you when you ask them to write you a recommendation phrase it like this would you be able to write me a good recommendation sometimes teachers and mentors aren t straightforward enough to tell someone that they wouldn t write a good recommendation a negative recommendation letter will hurt your application so make sure they have indicated that they will write good things about you submit the application on time make note of the deadline for the schools you want to apply to months in advance start working on the application immediately and ask your recommendation writers as soon as possible this will give all of you time to write and edit any application materials a good application will allow your art and grades to speak for themselves but only if you submit it think about your art while you are finalizing your application s reflect on your art the finishing touches to your application materials may benefit greatly from your ability to connect your art to bigger ideas this may involve talking about other artists or more general thoughts about your work,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to get your art submission ready,having your art shown at a gallery or a public space can be an exciting experience especially if you are just starting your art career whether you are submitting your artwork to an online gallery a local gallery or an art magazine you will need to create a strong submission that presents your work in the best possible way potential buyers gallery owners and art agents respond well to art submissions that are professional polished and thoughtful a good art submission will consist of a physical or online art portfolio a thorough artist resume and a brief artist statement once you submit your artwork for consideration make sure you follow up to find out if you ve made the cut,make a physical portfolio of your work use a 12 page hardcover art binder or folio this means you can have up to 24 images in the portfolio which is usually more than enough for an art submission avoid getting a 24 page art binder as that is too many images for one submission 1 x research source keep the spine and cover page simple by writing your name and portfolio use a clean minimal font for the entire portfolio print the portfolio on high quality paper and bind it properly so the pages lay flat submit an online portfolio most artists use online portfolios as they are easier to adjust and add to it may also be more convenient for gallery owners to click through images online rather than deal with a physical portfolio include your most recent work as well as a copy of your artist statement and your resume this will make it easier for gallery owners to find all your information in one place 2 x research source you can use free platforms like behance or adobe portfolio to create your portfolio other sites like wix squarespace and portfoliobox charge a monthly fee to host and maintain your online portfolio 3 x research source include high quality images of your artwork if you have a physical portfolio make sure your images are 4 by 6 inches 10 by 15 cm center the image so it is 4 5 inches 11 cm down the page if you have an online portfolio only use high quality jpegs that are 600 pixels or higher 4 x research source some galleries will ask for images of your artwork on a disc make sure you use high quality jpegs that are compatible with mac and pc name your image files with a number starting with your most recent work followed by your last name and the title for example 01_lastname_title you should also label the disc with your name and contact information caption each image with the title media and size put the title in italics include the height and width of the artwork you can also include your artist name list these details at the bottom of the images of your artwork 5 x research source for example you may write nightview sadie lee oil on canvas 14 x 20 or explosion fiona crackle mixed media 50 x 80 prepare a price list for your submission if necessary if you are selling your artwork you may include a price list for each work make a price list with a thumbnail of the images on a separate sheet or page this way you can submit your portfolio without attaching the price list if you d prefer 6 x research source for art submissions to a festival or magazine you may not need to include a price list if you are submitting to a gallery or an online site they may ask for a price list write a brief biography with your contact information note your full name your date of birth and where you were born you should also list your email your artist website or online portfolio and your contact number 7 x research source this information should be listed at the top of your resume preferably in the header for example you may write sadie lee b 1987 canada sadie_leeart gmail com http www sadielee com 567 541 2345 include your art related education include any post secondary schooling you have done in the field of visual art list the name of the school the degree received and the year you graduated for example you may write concordia university master of fine arts 2011 8 x research source if you do not have a degree in the visual arts field and are self taught you can leave this area blank do not list other types of education that do not relate to the artwork you make list your previous art exhibitions if any start with your most recent exhibitions include the year the title of the show in italics and where it was held such as a gallery space or a museum 9 x research source for example you may write 2011 some works the new gallery montreal if you have a large number of different exhibitions that you d like to list you can also note solo group and duo exhibitions for example you may write 2012 dysphoria group exhibition moca toronto make a bibliography of press or media about your artwork if you have done any news articles magazine interviews or had features in a publication about your work list them in your resume include the author of the piece the title and the publication as well as the publication date the volume and the page number 10 x research source for example you may write coupland douglas on dysphoria world art magazine vol 3 february 2012 p 45 50 list any art related awards grants or residencies make sure all the awards and grants relate to your artistic practice include the year and title of the award or grant 11 x research source for example you may write 2013 new artist award or 2011 new york arts council grant you can also note any artist residences you have done listing the year name and location of the residency for example you may write 2012 studio residency the new school new york give background information about your submission in a document separate from your resume write an artist statement that describes the inspiration for your artwork mention any themes or ideas you were considering while making the artwork use simple straightforward language to give the reader a bit of practical information about your work so they can put it in context 12 x research source for example you may write i was inspired by the elaborate traditional mourning shawls worn by my jewish grandmother or these pieces came out of my love of nature in the winter discuss the materials and processes used in your submission mention how you made the artwork including what types of art materials you used to create it you can also outline your creative process to give the reader a better sense of how you came up with the artwork 13 x research source for example you may write i created these pieces with oil drawn to the vibrant colors and textures of this medium or i made these pieces by layering lace fabric on wood and then spray painting the fabric black keep the statement under 500 words avoid writing a long winded multi page statement instead keep it short sweet and to the point only include the necessary details and get rid of any fluff aim for 500 words or less 14 x research source include an artist proposal if applicable only include a written artist proposal for the exhibition if the submission requirements asks for one the proposal focuses on a specific plan for an exhibition including a brief overview of the concept of the show and a number of works that are going to be included you can also note the details of the installation and a timeline for installing the show the proposal should be no longer than 500 to 750 words or one page 15 x research source you should also include short biographies of the artists and curators that will be involved in the show including yourself make the artist proposal a separate document from your artist statement email or mail in your submission some galleries and publications only accept email submissions make sure you include links to your online portfolio or high quality images of

how to pretend to understand art,if you don t have a lot of background in art talking about art whether at a museum or in conversation can be a little stressful you might be worried that you won t get the art or that you ll look silly in front of others preparing for a museum trip by getting some background information and carefully studying art that s in front of you can help you can also use conversational techniques to make it seem like you get art,study the artist s background beforehand knowing something about the artist when you visit the museum can help you understand the context of their artwork it can also give you something to say during conversations about the artist and their work 1 x research source browse the museum s or artists collections online depending on which museum or gallery you re visiting you might be able to preview the collection you re seeing on a website this gives you more time to look at and think about the pieces you ll be seeing and you can do so without the pressure of feeling like you have to contribute to the conversation happening around you for example if you are about to visit moma the museum of modern art in nyc you could do some research about modern art in general and research some of the pieces in the gallery ask a friend who won t judge perhaps one of your pals has an idea of what kind of art you may be seeing and or even have personal information about the artist ask them to share some of their knowledge there s nothing wrong with admitting you don t know much about the artist or type of art you ll be seeing and asking someone to educate you look carefully at the piece once you get to the museum or gallery you re visiting choose a piece of art and really look at it even if you have no previous knowledge of the artist or the collection you can ask yourself some questions about it what is it a painting a photograph a sculpture what s it made of paint pencil plastic how did the artist approach the medium does it look rushed like it took a lot of time looking at the piece and asking yourself questions can give you some material to work with when you re talking to your friends 2 x research source consider the piece as a whole once you ve noted what the piece is what it s made out of and how the artist might have approached it look at the piece as a whole how do the different elements come together in one piece of art how does it make you feel is there something sad about the medium used joyful consider the big picture of the piece of art and how the smaller components contribute to it being able to discuss those things can help you seem like you get art 3 x research source interpret the piece try to place it in the historical context in which it was created that s where those plaques next to artwork come in handy they might tell you about the artist s life why the artist used specific materials or what was happening in the world when the piece was created use those context clues to draw meaning from the art 4 x research source trust your instincts it s totally okay to look at a piece of art and decide that you like it or don t based only on your instincts but if you do feel that way take some time looking at the piece and trying to figure out why you do or don t like it it could be because of the colors or maybe the shape of the piece or the way someone or something in it looks being able to articulate why you do or don t like a piece of art can make you seem like you get it in conversation with others 5 x research source ask what other people think if you can t think of anything to say in conversation about art ask others what they think this takes the attention off of you and is a good conversational practice you should interest in other people you re speaking to 6 x research source really pay attention to what others are saying it s good manners and they might say something that gives you an idea for your own contribution to the conversation draw comparisons to things you know better if possible draw comparisons between the art you re looking at and or discussing and a topic you re more comfortable with it gives you the chance to speak about something you re more comfortable with it can also make you look like you understand art even more because you can connect it to other things 7 x research source for example maybe you re an avid reader and you have a favorite author does any of the artwork you re discussing remind you of the way you ve imagined a scene in a book share that give a general response sometimes you just might not be able to think of anything to say and that s okay you can say something like i don t know much about that or i m not really feeling it responding in a general way can also signal to other people that it s okay for them to talk a little more if they know more about the topic 8 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to identify prints,before digital and photographic technology images were transferred to paper from stone metal and wood part of a good education in art history involves studying and identifying these different printing processes while printmaking is a field you can study for life you can learn the basics of identifying relief intaglio and planographic lithography to start building your identification skills,understand the process of relief printing relief printing is the oldest and most traditional printing technology and involves reproducing images at its most basic in relief printing a wood or metal relief block is carved by cutting away the areas of the picture that will not be printed then ink is applied to the raised areas either by dabbing the areas to be printed or rolling the ink on the final stage of the process involves transferring the ink to the page by laying a sheet of paper and applying pressure examples of relief prints include wood block printing linocut type set examine the rim of the print one of the quickest and most reliable ways of identifying relief prints is to examine the edges of the print for evidence the process by which ink is transferred from the block via pressure will produce a characteristic rim around the edges of life this is a feature that is only characterized by relief printing processes so it s always a sure sign 1 x research source for comparison purposes examine the serial number on any bill of us currency you should notice the rim of the numbers is slightly darker than the inside this is a sign of relief printing look for this tendency in the piece that you re examining 2 x research source look for signs of embossing another fairly reliable way of identifying relief printing is to look at the back of the piece for signs of embossing another result of the transfer process in relief printing examine the page and feel with your hands for signs of raised perforation and pressure signifiers of the paper being pressed on the relief block compared with intaglio printing the pressure required to make relief prints is relatively minor meaning that embossing will sometimes be difficult to see and differentiate from that of intaglio printing which is more severe reflectance transformation imaging rti is often used to highlight and document the physical signifiers of embossing in relief printing 3 x research source look for signs of cutting in the cross hatching or shaded areas while it might seem obvious one of the best ways of distinguishing relief from intaglio printing is in examining the black marks as closely as possible and trying to decide whether it looks like they were raised or the white marks were raised on the original block this is part intuition and part experience but one of the best places to look is in shaded or cross hatched areas on relief prints you should be able to see that shading is made by cutting out little wedges between short lines then cutting a long line at right angles leaving smooth outside lines understand the process of intaglio printing intaglio is italian for incis ing and correspondingly revolves around a process of applying ink into the grooves or etches or engravings then using a lot of pressure to transfer that ink from the indents onto the page this usually results in slightly crisper more substantial lines that you can learn to identify the process was developed in the 1500s engraving and etching are both styles of intaglio printing with slightly different techniques and signifiers 4 x research source engraving is typically done on copper plates using a burin a v shaped cutting tool to remove slivers of metal from the surface of the plate the shape of engraved lines are typically quite clean and pointed at each end where the lines will swell or shrink etching is done using acid to draw freely over wax placed on the copper plating using a needle etched lines will have a blunter end than engraved lines and you should be able to see signs of the wax in unevenness and crumbling at the edge of the lines in general etched lines are less precise look for plate marks because lots of pressure is used to transfer the ink the metal printing plate will leave an impression in the paper on intaglio prints the corners of these marks should be rounded since sharped edges would rip the paper and the edges will often retain traces of ink that wasn t completely wiped off the plate during the printing process plate marks are always signifiers of intaglio printing whether engravings or etchings if you don t see a plate mark that isn t necessarily the sign that it isn t an intaglio print it won t show up on every intaglio if the plate was wiped off completely look for raised ink because of the way the printing process works the strongest and darkest lines should be raised when compared with the surrounding areas because it will take more pressure and more ink to make the darker line pop out this is one of the most reliable signifiers of intaglio printing etched or engraved look for varying intensity of color in single lines in intaglio printing the lines will have varying levels of intensity in terms of the ink displacement compared to relief printing which should be relatively uniform this is because the depth of the grooves can be adjusted resulting in darker or lighter printed lines accordingly in the same line look along longer lines to see whether or not they become darker in the interior if so it s almost surely a sign of intaglio printing look at the shape of the line engraved lines will flow smoothly swelling some before tapering to a point while etched lines lines will have shakier round edges often intaglio prints will involve bits of both types of printing as is found on us currency in the printed pictures on the front and back study more intaglio techniques there are lots of subcategories of intaglio printing that will display particulars of the process so you can narrow your identification skills even more specifically other intaglio techniques include aquatint mezzotint steel engraving stipple engraving understand the different varieties of lithography lithography is a big term often used to refer to many different styles of printing contemporary and classical but in pre photographic terms planographic lithography is that which is printed from a flat surface in planographic printing plates are prepared by laying down an image in a greasy or oily substance typically called tusche that will hold ink the blank areas of the plate will then be washed off with water removing the ink from those areas types of planographic lithography include chalk manner prints which are made by using wax crayon to draw the image onto limestone chromolithography which are identifiable based on the stippling of multiple colors on the plate tinted lithography is made via two plates one of which uses broad individual background strokes of tinting to give the image background color transfer lithography isn t transferred directly from stone to paper but from transfer paper to the stone itself meaning that the image needn t be drawn in reverse originally magnify the image unlike some of the other varieties of pre photographic print identification planographic lithography needs to be examined using at least 10x magnification to notice the signifiers necessary for proper identification since the absence of intaglio and relief printing marks doesn t necessarily mean you re dealing with a lithograph it s important to look closely at the images and not take absence for proof look for the absence of plate marks if you find plate marks you re always dealing with a relief or more likely an intaglio print because the image is taken directly from a flat stone there will never be plate marks of the sort you d find on those prints on a lithograph look for the flatness of the ink upon close examination you should notice that there is no difference in the depth of the ink and the blank paper everything should be on the same level with no imprinting of whiteness or darkness noticing this will require serious magnification but it s a good indication that you re dealing with some variety of planographic printing since the ink has come from a flat surface that didn t imprint itself in the paper look for the illusion of shade created by multiple layers since the planographic surface holds and repels ink on the same level tonal variation is created by varying the amount of surface area covered and not covered by varying the quantity of ink deposited on the paper either by using multiple layers and multiple prints or by applying areas of heavier wax on the stone usually shaded areas will be spotty shooting almost stipple like dots that have the same tonal value one mark will not be lighter or darker than the other surrounding marks nor should they be evenly spaced this creates the illusion of shade a print with multiple colors will overlap those colors in certain areas in general you won t find green but overlapping areas of blue and yellow a more efficient process of printing shade in color prints is typically made via variation of tone 5 x research source look for blurriness typically fine details will be somewhat blurrier in transfer lithographs than in other types of printmaking often the paper won t quite stick or will otherwise shift around when pressure is applied to the paper and the details tend to suffer when this happens this is typically a sign of planographic lithography processes 6 x research

how to survive an art school critique,art school can be intense especially when it comes to critique time whether it s an in class critique with your peers a studio visit with an instructor or a review with a panel of strangers critiques can be emotionally draining through proper preparation and confidence in your work you will be able to survive your critique with ease,develop a timeline for creating and finishing your project waiting until the last minute to create artwork can often be disastrous and you may find yourself creating something that you are not proud of and that will not be evaluated favorably by your professors and peers 1 x research source in order to create the most quality project possible as soon as you are aware of the assignment begin scheduling staggered deadlines for yourself to complete various stages of the project use a calendar or planner either paper or online to set deadlines for yourself so you remain on task breaking the task up into smaller parts can make it feel less overwhelming and can ease your stress both during the semester and on the day of the critique develop key talking points before the critique if you have a well thought out why to your work what it depicts its purpose and your thought process in creating it you will fare much better in the oral aspect of your critique a strong sense of knowledge and awareness of a piece that you created will be particularly helpful if your art is not its best on that particular project write down some bullet points on a note card or keep some thoughts in your mind to help begin and further along the discussion if your project is a collection of pieces be sure that you are prepared to articulate how they are related and interconnected communicate any questions or concerns to your professor your professors and instructors have an expansive knowledge of art and technique and are often more than willing to help should advice be solicited consult with them if you have any concerns or hesitations about making major decisions about projects for instance if you are confused about an assignment you might want to reach out to your professor via email and ask something like is there a specific painting technique we are required to use or any question related to the topic at hand breathe in stressful situations the body can often tense up making you forget to breathe which can lead to greater levels of anxiety and stress you will be better able to cope with the intensity of the moment and to discuss and defend your work if you are breathing properly one quick breathing exercise that you can do before during and after the critique is as follows breathe in deeply and slowly through your nose filling your lungs pause for three seconds and then exhale slowly through your mouth with your lips slightly parted stand by your idea if you ve made decisions for a specific reason explain them in an articulate and meaningful way if your reasoning for employing a certain design or technique is important share that information don t allow others to believe that your decisions were random or arbitrary if they were intentional for example if a classmate or your professor refers to your color choice as random you might want to speak to how the color you choose is symbolic and has a deeper meaning for instance the color red might symbolize passion blood or war keep an open mind to critiques and try not to be defensive it can be difficult to hear people pick apart your work but remember to listen to reactions and opinions they can help you further develop the piece and make it more successful and help you to develop your skills as an artist 2 x research source it can be helpful to ask for clarification if you are confused about a certain point if you still feel that a rebuttal to a comment is necessary search for something in the speaker s critique that you can agree with while respectfully disagreeing with their larger point for example you might say i do agree that my brush strokes in that area could have been more precise but i do not think that a change in scenery would convey the message that i sought to portray don t dominate the conversation though you should certainly speak to the strengths of your work as well as your design process allow for a thorough critique from others you will want to receive feedback on your craft so that you can improve your work don t interrupt anyone as they are critiquing your work but rather listen as intently as possible take notes or have someone take notes for you critiques can be a bit of a whirlwind and it is easy to forget names of artists suggestions and reactions often times you will receive so many comments and suggestions that it would be impossible to remember them all therefore having everything written down will help you as you incorporate relevant suggestions later the experience can be an overwhelming one so try not to dwell too much on the details in the moment but revisit them later in your notes instead don t take it personally it is more likely than not that most of those offering critiques are truly trying to help and are not doing so maliciously don t take their comments as being inherently negative but rather use the collective knowledge and strength in the room to your advantage later when editing your project in addition to not overreacting to negative critiques you should also not allow positive feedback to overinflate your ego a positive critique is always welcome but too much confidence can make you lazy with future projects 3 x research source reflect on the feedback given talk about it with someone if you need to vent sort out your thoughts or celebrate you may want to discuss the information with classmates who have endured similar critiques or with fellow artists in general make sure that you consider both the positive and the negative critiques offered use the notes taken during your critique to think critically about your work read over them carefully and thoughtfully and begin to ponder on how you can synthesize these critiques to create a stronger project be selective in the critiques you choose to incorporate into your work don t feel like you have to listen to everything everyone says as this is very likely impossible as many may have conflicting ideas on how to improve your work from the feedback you receive pick and choose which ideas appeal to you and make any alterations to those suggestions that you deem appropriate get to work now you ll want to begin actually improving upon your work and incorporating the new approaches that you see most fit creating a project that successfully and strategically synthesizes good feedback will result in a stronger piece of artwork that will likely be critiqued even less for example if you agree with certain feedback presented about your project you will want to incorporate these improvements someone may have suggested that you lighten up the work using more pastel colors so you could employ this in your art to create a stronger and more pleasing aesthetic,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to write an artist s statement,it is quite hard to write a really good artist statement even if you re a good writer the statement accompanies a piece or set of work you ve painted drawn photographed created and it must sum up such elements as motivation description and backstory ultimately if you can use the appropriate words to convey the meaning of the art from your perspective it will add another layer of meaning for the viewer to learn from,ask yourself some questions before you can write your statement you should ask yourself some important questions your statement is your chance to discuss your art process your ideas and how your art fits in the field be honest with yourself as you answer these questions 1 x research source what are my influences e g personal historical theoretical cultural what themes ideas and subjects are in my art what do i do how do i do it why do i it what do i want other people to understand about my art is there anything about my art that i do not want to discuss why write down your ideas set a timer for 15 minutes and write down your responses to these questions if your responses lead you down another path write about those things as well this exercise helps you move your ideas from your head to a piece of paper you can incorporate drawings into this writing process as well it may be helpful to target your writing to one specific question instead of trying to answer multiple questions for example you may choose to write about why you use oil to paint you can also write on multiple pieces of art paper instead of a notebook so that you can rearrange your ideas and make them more visual mind map your ideas a mind map is a visual diagram that lets you connect information to once central idea think of it as an idea tree 2 x research source write the answer to one of your questions in the middle of the page the you can use arrows or dotted lines for all of the answers to your questions 3 x research source all of the arrows and or dotted lines do not have to connect to the center of the diagram some of them may connect to each other you can also use pictures or drawings to communicate your thoughts and answers read some examples reading examples of good and poorly written artist s statements can help you craft your statement pay special attention to artists whose work is similar to yours and artists that you admire 4 x research source you may want to read examples after you have finished brainstorming this will help you format your ideas without being influenced by others check out books exhibition catalogs and periodicals to find examples if you are in school ask your teacher for examples or talk to a librarian take note of the phrasing that people use to describe their work talk to your friends it can be hard to write about your art display your art and invite some of your friends over video and or audio record the conversation so you can listen to it later you should also take notes during the discussion 5 x research source pay special attention to any questions and critiques about your work these things are often what people really want to know about your work consider discussing your work with both artists and non artists this will allow you to see your art from multiple perspectives another option is to have a friend interview you about your work create an image with your words your artist s statement should stand on its own someone should be able to read your statement and imagine what your work looks like 6 x research source create a list of words and phrases that describe your work your process and your influences once you have created your list edit down your list to the items that most reflect your work and who you are as an artist create sentences using the words and phrases that you have identified you can combine and arrange your sentences until they flow in a logical order you may need to repeat this process multiple times until you are satisfied with the outcome also think about the time and space that you would like the reader to view your work describe what kind of art you make this section of your statement is where you write exactly what you make let your readers know what your project is include information about why you are interested in this type of work and any themes that may be found in your work you can describe your art in any way that you choose just remember that you must support your description with the how and why you make the art 7 x research source write the methods you used to make your art once you describe the art you make describe the methods you use to make the art what materials e g paint wood paper etc do you use what tools e g brush hands etc did you use do you paint on the floor or do you use an easel do you always listen to music when you work what techniques do you use 8 x research source you do not have to write down every single step of the process that was used to create the work note the things that are most important if you do something particularly unusual during your process include that in your statement write down why you make your art your motivation and purpose for creating art provides a context for people that view your art it also helps people understand your point of view as an artist is your art commentary on current events or social circumstances are you trying to draw connections between different concepts 9 x research source are you using your art to tell a story what does your art mean to you if your motivations changed while you were working on the project let the audience know that is well maybe you were influenced by a trip you took a book you read a movie or a family member all of these things help the audience get a better understanding of you and your work for example if you wanted your art discussed within the context of feminism you should clearly outline that in this part of your statement 10 x research source use clear concise language your statement should be easy to understand do not include any language that is too specific to the art world also avoid using complicated complex words your statement should sound genuine and real your statement should add information that can not be gathered from looking at your art do not use the statement to simply describe what the audience can see with their own eyes 11 x research source try not to use a quote from another artists or philosopher if you do use a quote do not use more than one and keep it short also be sure that you have correctly interpreted the quote avoid phrases such as i am trying to i am hoping to and i would like to 12 x research source just state what you have done be as objective as possible your statement should not be used to promote your art or talk it up 13 x research source let your audience interpret your work on their own determine where your statement will be used you may need to modify your statement based on where your statement will be used if you artist statement is for a particular piece or project your statement should be tailored to that specific piece if you artist statement is part of your portfolio it should be a broader description update your statement every time you add a new piece of work to your portfolio 14 x research source you may also need an artist statement when you apply for scholarships grants or schools 15 x research source always check the guidelines when you are submitting it as part of an application edit to one page or less artist statements are usually 25 words one or two paragraphs or one page one page statements are used to describe your whole body of work or to accompany an exhibition or as part of a grant application one or two paragraph

how to write about contemporary art,contemporary art is a wide field encompassing everything from huge immersive light and sound experiences to modern pottery to graffiti art but writing about art does not have to be an intimidating process start by analyzing the artwork itself then use your observations to form an argument and start drafting your piece finally work on revising your writing to make it as polished as possible,examine the content of the artwork itself when looking at the artwork examine the contents of the pieces and consider what you can learn from them some questions to consider include are there recognizable figures or objects within the artwork if so how are these portrayed if people are included what are the people doing in the artwork what can you tell about them from the way they are painted their pose or objects that are included in the artwork around them does the artwork portray a particular place or location if so how do you recognize it what objects are portrayed in the artwork if any are there other particular details about the artwork that stand out to you look at the medium and the materials the artist has chosen to use what materials has the artist chosen to create this particular piece of art and how is it presented to the viewer the choice to use paints on a canvas for example is a very different decision from using clay to create a sculpture the medium of the artwork may be only one or two things such as clay or paint and canvas or it may be a blend of different mediums and objects working together to create a whole consider how the items and materials the artist has chosen help to convey a certain idea or effect through the artwork ask yourself why the artist might have chosen these materials specifically do any of the materials or elements of the piece explore movement or action consider whether the artwork is meant to convey any kind of motion or if it has elements that move and how this adds to the overall effect decide whether there is any symbolism present in the artwork symbolism in artwork can take many different forms some of the most common ones include allegory is using concrete images figures or objects to convey abstract ideas ask yourself whether the artwork is looking to use specific images or objects to call to mind more abstract ideas such as emotions abstract shapes lines and forms can also be used to convey symbolism look at the artwork and see if you feel that the artist is looking to represent something by using abstract elements look at whether there are central objects or motifs within the artwork is your eye drawn to a particular place within the artwork does the artist use repeating design elements or symbols take notes on what your emotional response is to the artwork try to go deeper than simply considering whether you like the artwork or not good points to consider are does the artwork bring up any particular feelings or emotions for you when you look at it what kind of mood do you think the artist is trying to convey with this piece what particular elements of the artwork contribute to your feelings about the piece overall 1 x research source develop a thesis statement for your piece your thesis statement should be your overall argument about the artwork it should be one or two sentences that summarize your argument and essentially tells your reader what your piece will be about if you are having trouble coming up with an argument good questions to ask yourself are what do you think the artwork is meant to demonstrate or show to the viewer how does this piece of artwork compare to others either by the same artist or a different artist what details did you notice about the artwork and why might they be important identify examples to help prove your point once you have your main argument identify specific examples and evidence to help support your point these should be specific features of or about the artwork that you feel help demonstrate your argument and that you can talk about in detail don t be afraid to revise your argument if you have to sometimes the evidence for your argument can wind up leading you in a new direction make sure you choose examples you can talk about remember that most of your piece will be spent discussing specific examples outline your overall piece once you have chosen some examples it s a good idea to sit down and outline your piece as you work through your outline write down what you plan to talk about in each paragraph in turn you do not have to go into great detail to start just a few words or sentences to jog your memory later is sufficient note which examples you are going to use and where you are going to use them this will help you make sure you have gathered all your evidence and are not repeating examples write your body paragraphs examining your examples in detail once you have your outline sit down and work on writing through a first draft of your piece try to stick to discussing a single idea or example in each paragraph this will help keep your argument focused when discussing your examples remember to always be telling the reader how each example supports your argument don t worry too much about whether your writing is perfect it s more important to get a first draft done than to have it turn out perfectly wrap up your ideas in a final concluding paragraph your conclusion should briefly re summarize your argument for your reader once you ve written your conclusion take a look back at your thesis statement does your thesis match the argument you make in your conclusion if not consider revisiting your thesis it s not uncommon for your argument to shift or become more in depth as you are writing 2 x research source give yourself a break before going back to your draft don t turn around and start trying to revise your piece as soon as you ve finished it stepping away from your writing for a while will help you come back to it with a fresh perspective focus on the big issues in your piece rather than things like punctuation and spelling while smaller issues are easy to deal with and often easier to spot save those for the very end of your editing process when you first go back to you draft consider larger issues about the piece such as does your argument remain consistent throughout the piece do you still agree with your thesis statement do your examples successfully support your argument do you take time to analyze your examples in detail do your ideas transition smoothly from one point to the next does your piece follow an order that makes sense remember that good revision takes time it s unlikely that you will find yourself rewriting the entire piece but remember that you will probably wind up doing a lot of reworking after your first draft read your writing aloud to someone reading your work to a friend or colleague is one of the best ways to catch mistakes in your writing as you read take notes on any changes you want to make try to make brief notes such as rewrite this sentence rather than rewriting the sentence on the spot stopping too often will make it hard for your listener to follow ask your listener for specific feedback especially if there were any places where they did not understand what you were saying or found it hard to follow your ideas don t try to tackle every single revision at once after reading through your first draft you may have a lot of notes and changes that you want to make don t feel as though you have to complete every single one at first running through multiple drafts is part of the process try choosing just a few things to focus on such as your examples or your organization with each draft save proofreading for your last draft but if you see mistakes as you are working on your revisions don t hesitate to correct them 3 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service

print in either case cut your dry mounting paper to size your dry mounting paper should be the exact same size if not only slightly smaller than the size of your print if you need to adjust the size of the sheet or roll of dry mounting paper layer your print over the top and outline it if you re worried about getting the dry mounting paper the exact same size measure it to be ⅛ inch short on every side this way there won t be any overlap and possible smearing of the heated paper prepare a clothing iron although you can use a dry mounting press to dry mount your prints they tend to be very expensive and not incredibly easy to get your hands on if you d rather take the frugal route a regular clothing iron will work perfectly 4 x research source use one that doesn t have a steam attachment or that allows you to turn the steam off as any moisture used on the dry mounting paper and print will ruin it it is best to have a separate iron to use for dry mounting from your regular clothing iron as one that you use on a regular basis is likely to be dirty or have scratches that could ruin your print instead of purchasing a brand new clothing iron look for one at a local thrift store and pay half the price just make sure the platen is clean and scratch free so that you don t damage your prints heat up your iron follow the package directions on your dry mounting paper to see what temperature is needed for the mounting process typically this should range between 160 200 f 71 93 c turn on your iron and allow it to preheat while you begin getting your print prepared for mounting line up your print paper and backing layer your print over your dry mounting paper and your chosen backing so that everything is centered make sure that none of the dry mounting paper is sticking out from under the print as this could damage the front side of your print when heated tape your print in place you will start heating the center of your print to dry mount it before you get to the edges so keep your print in place by taping the edges with painters tape or masking tape make sure the print paper and backing are all secure before you begin dry mounting because you won t be able to move them back into place once you start place a piece of blotting paper over your print although your print should withstand heat without damage direct heat from the platen of the iron could scorch or bubble the ink or paper lay a piece of blotting paper over the top of the taped in place print in order to act as a shield against damage place your iron on the center of the print the heat from the iron will glue the three layers together keeping them in place for the rest of the mounting process let the iron set without moving it on the center of the print for 3 5 minutes when the print is firmly attached to the backing you can move onto the next section 5 x research source continue mounting the corners with the iron follow the same practice as above by moving the iron to each of the corners and edges of the print and allowing it to sit and heat the dry mounting paper for 3 5 minutes moving the iron around or back and forth during this process will make it take longer for the dry mounting process to complete so just watch the paper to make sure it isn t too hot without moving it each time you are ready to move to a new corner set the iron in the center and slide it out to the corner this will remove any bubbles that might have formed under the print from the dry mounting paper un tape the sides of the print when you are ready to dry mount that area be careful not to pull the print away from the freshly mounted backing when you remove the tape finish up when your print is securely attached to the backing on all sides then the dry mounting process is complete allow it to cool for several minutes and then remove the paper at this point you are finished follow up with a picture frame for a truly completed look,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to remove a painting from a frame,sometimes it is necessary to reframe a painting due to its value uniqueness or in order to transport it compactly instead of throwing away the work of art removing and reframing can give a picture a renewed display time,assess the damage to the painting if serious you may need to hire a professional restorer examine the front and back of the frame determine the method of attachment removal is reversal of assembly 1 x research source note which staples go to which part of the assembly remove staples nails or screws from back of frame 2 x research source it is not necessary to take out the staples holding the stretcher bar itself use pliers to remove the staples if they don t come out easily 3 x research source continue around the back of the picture smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb b b9 img_3623_208 jpg 460px img_3623_208 jpg bigurl images thumb b b9 img_3623_208 jpg 728px img_3623_208 jpg smallwidth 460 smallheight 345 bigwidth 728 bigheight 546 licensing div class mw parser output p author took photo 1 08 pliers removing staple from frame n p p image by uploader br nlicense a rel nofollow class external text href https creativecommons org licenses by 3 0 creative commons a n p div carefully wedge in the screwdriver to get a grip on the spline remove the spline from all the way around the painting pull any staples nails found holding the canvas to the frame being careful not to rip the canvas material too much it may need to be re attached to another stretcher bar if the current one is not reusable gently push the canvas backward or frame forward to separate from each other slowly poke under the canvas 4 x research source the wood stretcher bar holds the canvas giving it shape there is a crevice into which the spline used to fit pinching the canvas taut this is the same principle a screen door uses continue around the edge of the frame picture there may be many years that the canvas has been pressed folded it is not glued to the wood but may be stuck slightly if transporting carefully roll up around a foam cylinder and place in sturdy carton 5 x research source wrap loosely so paint does not chip and break off,Arts-and-Entertainment

cause all sorts of damage so you want to store your art in a dark place choose a windowless room such as a finished basement or study to store your artwork 1 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source keep the room at a temperature of about 70 f 21 c for most artworks a steady cool temperature is ideal more extreme climates can crack paint warp or yellow paper and foster mold growth 2 x research source if the room you ve selected goes through drastic changes in temperature during different seasons you should pick another location to store your art if you are not storing art in your home your next best option is a storage unit give nearby storage companies a call and ask if they have temperature controlled units available if you have a local art gallery near you you can call and ask them for recommended storage services 3 x research source maintain a humidity of 50 in the storage room materials like paint and wood are especially sensitive to humidity keeping a constant moderate level of humidity in the storage area will keep your artwork from changing shape or getting moldy 4 x research source you can moderate the room s humidity using a humidifier or dehumidifier 5 x research source put on gloves before touching any art some art materials are hypersensitive even to the natural oils on your fingertips wearing cotton or powder free latex gloves when handling your art can prevent you from accidentally causing it harm 6 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source check to see if all works are dry if you re storing any paintings sculptures or ceramics make sure they re completely dry before handling some artwork such as oil paintings can take up to an entire year to dry 7 x research source clean your art cleaning artwork before storage will help extend its lifespan a dry microfiber cloth rag or paper towel is enough to clean most artwork gently sweep it across frames glass panes ceramics and acrylic paintings you can brush over painted surfaces drawings and mixed media with a wide soft makeup or paint brush 8 x research source clean metal sculptures or frames with an oil based polish and buff with a dry rag 9 x research source you can use masking tape to gently lift dust off of an oil painting 10 x research source protect framed paintings with acid free tissue acid is in many paper and packing materials and will age art much faster and can change its color using acid free tissue wrap around the painting to protect it and give it breathing room then roll it into a padding like bubble wrap to protect the frame you can wrap paintings with plastic wrap instead of tissue but you risk sealing humidity inside if your art is part of a valuable collection steer clear of it 11 x research source group smaller prints together in a folder put acid free paper or tissue between the prints if they are unprotected slip your prints into sturdy folders with about 10 15 in each 12 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums

glassine online at a printmaking shop or in an art supply store cut a sheet of glassine about two times the size of each piece wrap it as you might a present then tape it facedown onto a piece of foamcore 13 x research source you also have the option to roll your work into the glassine but it may be more difficult to flatten once you remove it from storage wrap sculptures and other 3d objects in bubble wrap when preparing to store sculptures wrap them in bubble wrap use multiple layers if necessary tape the bubble wrap in place place all wrapped artwork into boxes you should try to give each item its own sturdy cardboard box though you can place folders horizontally in a box together once you ve put your art in boxes stuff the rest of each box with newspaper to prevent the art from shifting around 14 x research source handle one piece at a time you don t want to ruin all of your hard work and preparation by trying to store it too quickly move your artwork piece by piece when

how to light artwork on a wall,when it comes to wall art lighting can make all the difference choosing an appropriate lighting fixture can give your wall art the perfect spotlight it needs to stand out the type of bulb and the temperature of its light will also make a difference bright white lights can add a more modern gallery like aesthetic to your home while warmer more yellow lights can provide a cozy intimate feel how you display the artwork on the wall can complement and elevate your design scheme while ensuring the artwork s colors stay vivid over time,install track lighting for flexibility and a modern industrial look track lights can slide along the installation beam which is useful if you regularly change your art display or decide to move your art pieces around on the same wall you ll need to consider the height of your ceiling before you install the track lighting to ensure the light hits the artwork at a 30 degree angle 1 x research source if your ceilings are 8 feet 2 4 m high install the track 24 inches 61 cm away from the wall where the art is hanging for a ceiling 10 feet 3 0 m high the track should be 33 inches 84 cm away from the wall for a ceiling 12 feet 3 7 m high place the track 51 inches 130 cm away from the wall use a wall washer with multiple bulbs to evenly illuminate a large piece a wall washer is a long strip of several small lights in a single unit washers are great for lighting wall art because each bulb ensures even light is projected onto the piece you can either mount them from the ceiling near where it meets the wall or from the wall itself about 8 inches 20 cm to 12 inches 30 cm above the top of the artwork 2 x research source wall washers mounted from the ceiling directly above the artwork are ideal for lighting artwork with lots of texture if you want to use recessed washers in the ceiling take the height into count for example if you have 8 ft 2 4 m ceilings mount the washing fixture 18 inches 46 cm to 24 inches 61 cm away from the wall so the light hits the artwork at a 30 degree angle mount a picture light on top of art frames for an intimate viewing experience picture lights can be more inviting and cozy which is ideal for a small den or family room they typically use low wattage lamps that will invite you to stand closer to the piece to look at it a picture light won t work if the art doesn t have a sturdy frame that you can attach it to 3 x research source if you re a renter this is a great option because it doesn t require cutting or drilling holes in the ceiling note that some picture lamps have cords so you ll need an outlet nearby other types require batteries typically aaa size that you ll need to replace as necessary the shade size of the picture light lamp should be at least 1 2 the width of the artwork e g do not use a picture lamp that s less than 12 inches 30 cm long for a painting that s 24 inches 61 cm wide 4 x research source mimic a professional gallery with bright white halogen lights most art galleries and museums use halogen lights because of their high color rendering index cri which is a number that determines how correctly a light brings out the true color of an object halogen lights typically score the highest with a cri of 95 to 100 5 x research source one downside to halogen bulbs is that they get extremely hot so it s important to keep them away from flammable materials and the painting itself halogen bulbs have an average lifespan of 2 000 hours so you ll need to replace them more often depending on how long you leave them on each day halogen bulbs are a great choice if you plan to install track lighting because it will be far enough from the painting to provide a spotlight and not so close that the heat might damage the painting use led bulbs to showcase oil paintings while using less energy many galleries use led bulbs because they emit a diffused more uniform light that won t cause uneven streaks and highlights on oil paintings they re the most energy efficient bulb and last 10 000 to 25 000 hours the longest lifespan of any type of bulb 6 x research source led lights come in a variety of temperatures from warm white light to cool white and daylight consider using a dimmable led bulb if you like the flexibility of highlighting or lowlighting your artwork choose an incandescent bulb for a warm yellow light incandescent bulbs will highlight the red yellow gold and orange tones in an art piece which can also create a flattering contrast for blues and greens they re perfect for accenting artwork in a cozy bedroom den or dining room 7 x research source incandescent bulbs typically come in 60 70 or 100 watt varieties so choose a wattage that s higher than the other bulbs in the room to make the art piece pop a disadvantage is that incandescent bulbs aren t considered environmentally friendly they produce a lot of heat decreasing their already short lifespan of 750 to 1 000 hours and emit carbon dioxide flatter cool toned artwork with compact fluorescent light cfl bulbs cfl bulbs are the more energy efficient version of traditional fluorescent and incandescent lights a 23 watt cfl bulb will emit the same amount of light as a 100 watt incandescent bulb the light tends to be on the cooler side which is perfect if you have paintings with a lot of cool colors like green blue and purple 8 x research source while they can be more expensive than regular fluorescent bulbs they ll last about 9 000 hours cfl bulbs also come in low color temperature ranges that emit warmer yellowish light that flatters paintings with warm colors red orange and yellow hues a disadvantage of cfl bulbs is that they have a relatively low cri compared to other bulbs 50 to 90 meaning it won t render the colors as true as they re meant to be note that cfl bulbs emit a small number of uv rays so it s best to only use cfl bulbs with art that s framed with uv filtering plexiglass pick a color temperature that complements the colors of the artwork the color temperature of the bulb is reported in kelvins look at the painting and assess whether you want to highlight the warm or cool tones that is red yellow and orange hues versus gree blue and purple tones look at the bulb s package to determine it s kelvin value 9 x research source a low range 2700 to 3000k emit a warmer light much like incandescent bulbs and will enhance red and yellow tones cool colors might look a little dull under this type of light higher values 3500 to 6500k give off a brighter white light that will bring out blues and greens in the artwork at a very high level reds yellows and oranges might look slightly distorted place the artwork on a wall that isn t exposed to sunlight sunlight can cause colors to dull over time so hang your artwork on an interior wall that doesn t get any sunlight throughout the day if this isn t an option use curtains to protect your artwork from the strong morning and afternoon light 10 x research source another option is to frame the artwork with uv filtering acrylic plexiglass instead of regular glass for unframed paintings purchase uv protecting varnish from any art supply store and spray it onto the painting adjust the light so it hits the art at a 30 degree angle whether you re using recessed pendants or surface mounted lights the light should hit the artwork at a 30 degree angle increase the angle to 35 degrees to highlight any textural aspects of the art just don t go over a 45 degree angle because it will cause a distracting glare either from the frame s glass or the from the artwork s varnish 11 x research source lighting a piece from a 10 degree angle is too close and may end up casting shadows onto the art if you re using a picture light choose one that sticks out a little from the painting so it s not being lit from directly overhead however feel free to break the 30 degree rule if you like the look of direct overhead lighting on a particular piece of art hang artwork at eye level or 57 inches 140 cm from the center to the floor galleries and museums abide by this rule because it s the most comfortable viewing angle for most people use a tape measure and pencil to mark a spot 57 inches 140 cm from the floor hold the painting up to the wall to determine where exactly you need to hang it so that point meets the center of the painting 12 x research source note that you will not be putting the nail into the center marking you ll need to make a hole higher on the wall depending on the length of the wire hanger if you re hanging artwork over a couch the bottom of the painting should be 8 inches 20 cm to 10 inches 25 cm above the back of the couch however feel free to break this rule as you like by leaning a tall painting against the wall hanging a small painting over a doorway or hanging it higher to create the illusion of tall ceilings 13 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to clean an oil painting,the surfaces of oil paintings are unique and sensitive and over time they can collect dirt grime and stains since you can t use water alcohol or household cleaners to get the job done you may be unsure how to clean an oil painting without damaging it use a dry soft paintbrush to clean surface dust and dirt or you can use your own saliva and a cotton swab to remove grime if your painting is valuable or antique take it to a professional conservator to be cleaned,place the oil painting on a stable surface if the painting is stable where it s already hanging on the wall you can leave it in place to clean it however it s usually recommended that the painting be taken down and placed on a flat stable table or propped up against a sturdy easel for the best results removing the painting from the wall also allows you to look at the painting in different lighting conditions and get a better view of the dirt on the surface select a dry soft paintbrush the larger the painting the larger the brush should be otherwise you might be dusting a large piece with a small paintbrush for hours no matter what size you choose feel the bristles first to make sure they re soft and free of moisture before you get started 1 x research source sable bristled paintbrushes are known for their softness and considered to be safe for this procedure 2 x research source feather dusters may seem soft but they are not recommended for this task feathers have barbs that can scratch the surface of an oil painting dust the first section gently with the paintbrush starting at one of the top corners swish the paintbrush very lightly back and forth across the surface working on several inches at a time then work your way slowly down that section of the painting until you reach the bottom 3 x research source working from the top down ensures that the dust is removed rather than just moved around continue working in small sections until the entire painting is dusted move to the next section and starting at the top lightly brush back and forth as you work your way down the painting continue in this way until you ve dusted the entire piece take your time and don t increase the pressure of your brush strokes this technique only removes superficial dust and dirt from the surface of the painting ingrained grime deep soiling stains and other issues can t be cleaned this way no matter how hard you push the brush into the surface 4 x research source work slowly be gentle and take your time for the best results dampen the end of a cotton swab with your saliva brush the cotton swab lightly across your tongue until the cotton feels damp but not saturated using your spit to clean a work of art might seem extremely odd but museum curators and other professionals around the world have been using this method effectively and safely for centuries 5 x research source saliva has enough enzymes to break down dirt and grime but not so much that it will damage the paint it s best to use high quality cotton swabs since those tend to have the softest tips swipe one of the corners first to gauge the painting s reaction before wiping down the entire painting with a q tip it s best to do a spot test in one of the corners so you can make sure the saliva isn t damaging the surface saliva is generally considered to be safe and effective but it s best to be cautious 6 x research source if any of the paint color shows up on the cotton swab do not proceed dab the moistened cotton swab over the painting in small sections it s best to work on 1 square inch of the surface at a time so this technique can be very time consuming don t move the cotton swab from side to side though swipe it up and down in small light dabbing motions 7 x research source switch to the clean end once the cotton swab starts to look grimy simply moisten the other end by running it over your tongue and continue swiping when that end gets dirty discard the swab and grab a fresh one depending on the size of the painting and how dirty it is you may go through many many q tips before your task is complete it s important to switch to a fresh swab frequently to avoid swiping the painting s surface with a dirty tool take valuable or antique oil paintings to a professional conservator the surface of an oil painting is fragile and it can be permanently changed or damaged by home cleaning techniques if your oil painting is old worth money or holds great sentimental value cleaning it at home is not recommended take it to a professional conservator to have it cleaned 8 x research source get valuable paintings insured before allowing a professional to clean it 9 x research source if you re determined to clean the painting yourself practice on a non valuable oil painting first to gauge the results of your techniques 10 x research source do not use bread or potatoes to clean your oil painting many amateurs will tell you that wiping the surface of an oil painting with a slice of doughy bread or a cut potato is a great way to remove dirt and grime from the surface this is not a good idea especially if your painting is valuable or old food based cleaning techniques can leave behind crumbs and residue 11 x research source if your piece is extremely dirty and you re willing to risk the possibility of damaging it consider trying food based techniques avoid water rubbing alcohol and baby oil using water can change the appearance of the oil paint on the canvas and rubbing alcohol can remove the paint completely some people think that baby oil can return suppleness to the surface of an oil painting and make the colors look brighter but baby oil actually makes the surface sticky and even more susceptible to attracting dirt 12 x research source your painting can be irreversibly damaged by using any of these substances to clean it 13 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source if you re willing to take the risk lightly dampen a soft cloth with water and brush the surface gently with it to remove dirt and grime take oil paintings to a professional conservator to remove varnish varnish is a clear protective layer on the surface of an oil painting if the varnish looks dirty but you think the painting itself is clean underneath it you may be tempted to remove the dirty varnish yourself and apply a fresh layer unless you ve been trained or have experience with this don t attempt it 14 x research source an oil painting can be permanently damaged if this is

how to clean an acrylic painting,these days it s becoming increasingly common for artists to use water based acrylic paints in their pieces because of their softer texture however these paints have a tendency to attract dust and dirt and hold them in place in order to properly maintain a collection of acrylic paintings it s essential to know the best way to clean them without damaging the medium usually a gentle dusting or wipe down will be enough to touch up most acrylic paintings use a soft brush or a mild soap solution to clean your art then see that it s stored properly to preserve its original beauty for years to come,make sure the paint is dry the most important thing to keep in mind when preparing to clean an acrylic painting is that the paint must be completely dry if it s still wet you may smudge the outermost layer of paint dulling the colors and wearing down distinctive features such as the artist s brushstrokes once acrylic paint has cured you can carefully clean the outer surface without worrying about causing damage 1 x research source wait at least 24 hours before attempting to clean newly completed paintings the slightest blemish on an original piece of artwork may be enough to depreciate its value purchase a soft bristled brush look for a brush with a wide base and fine bristles made from natural materials like hair you can use this tool to whisk away loose dirt and debris clinging to the acrylic paint in many cases a good dusting every now and then is all a painting will need to keep it in good condition 2 x research source a makeup brush or hand duster will work well for this purpose the brush should be clean and dry before it comes into contact with the acrylic painting 3 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source brush off the surface of the painting go over the exterior of the painting lightly using long fluid strokes work from one of the upper corners of the painting across and down until you ve dislodged all visible dust and dirt be careful not to apply too much pressure as this may leave behind marks on the soft acrylic 4 x research source don t forget to address dust that s built up on the frame or surrounding surfaces as well 5 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source to remove a heavier layer of dust hold a vacuum cleaner hose close to the painting as you brush it dust your paintings regularly acrylic paintings should be dusted thoroughly every couple of months this is especially important if the painting is being stored or displayed in a private residence or somewhere else that doesn t provide the benefits of highly regulated storage conditions frequent dusting will reduce the chances of dirt being absorbed into the acrylic paint as it undergoes textural changes 6 x research source when it comes to preserving works of art prevention is always more effective than cleaning 7 x research source be aware of the risks of cleaning the painting yourself even though they re less temperamental than other types of paint acrylics can still be ruined with inappropriate materials and techniques before you employ diy cleaning methods understand that tampering with a painting may ultimately lower its value 8 x research source consider having valuable works cleaned professionally by a qualified art restorer though it will cost more you ll be able to rest assured that the painting is receiving proper treatment never use harsh chemicals or abrasive tools to clean a painting this includes traditional substances such as mineral spirits and turpentine as well as commercial cleaners combine soap and water in a large container fill a sink or bucket with clean warm water add a few drops of a non astringent liquid dish detergent and stir the mixture by hand until it forms a mild solution you can use this solution to spot clean cured acrylic paintings 9 x research source the detergent will help emulsify dirt and grime to lift them from the surface of the paint while the water flushes them away dampen a cloth or sponge for best results use a cloth made from a soft material like cotton or microfiber saturate the cloth with the soap solution then wring out as much excess water as possible if you re using a sponge give it a good shake before you begin it should just barely be damp make sure there s no heavy soap residue on the cleaning cloth some types of acrylic paint are water soluble if there is too much moisture in the cloth it may begin to dissolve the paint creating a blotchy fuzzy appearance 10 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source wipe down the painting carefully go over the painting with long smooth strokes from top to bottom and from side to side clear away as much accumulate grime as you can don t scrub or apply too much pressure as this is practically guaranteed to strip the paint off if necessary make multiple passes allowing the surface of the painting to dry between each attempt 11 x research source fold the cloth a few times to create a wider surface area this will help distribute the moisture more evenly over the paint and help you avoid pressure smudges test the soap solution on a corner or another out of the way area to see what effect it has before wiping the entire painting 12 x research source apply a varnish varnish is a type of resin based clear coat that can protect painted works from dust dirt moisture and other factors that can cause deterioration brush or spray a thin coating of varnish over the unprotected surface of the painting then let it dry overnight afterwards the painting will be more resistant to dust making it easier and safer to keep clean 13 x research source make sure you select a varnish that has been specially formulated for use on acrylic paints if you choose the wrong kind it may severely degrade the paint 14 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source brush off the surface of the painting before you apply a varnish to keep dust from becoming trapped in the clear coat store paintings in a dust free environment because acrylic paints are slightly tacky they can easily trap dust particles floating around in the environment for this reason it s best to keep prized artwork somewhere with a minimal amount of dust make an effort to vacuum and dust high traffic areas on a consistent basis to cut down on the amount of dust in the air that might find its way onto nearby paintings 15 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source paintings are more likely to gather dust when they re mounted

artwork at a considerable savings you ll be left with a beautiful finished print and a full wallet,choose a dry mount paper there are many different brands of dry mounting paper available on the market today the paper can be purchased in pre cut packages or in rolls depending on the size you are going for the primary thing to consider when choosing a paper though is whether or not it is acid free and archival traditionally dry mounting paper can cause bubbling and damage to prints for a bit more money though you can purchase specialty paper that won t ruin your prints over time most dry mounting is also permanent although there are some options that are removable 1 x research source fotoflat is dry mounting paper that is removable with low heat after application on the downside if your print is exposed to sunlight or heat it may remove itself from the backing on its own mt5 is a permanent dry mounting paper that requires high temperatures in order to adhere to the print the con of this paper is that the necessary high temperatures may damage or burn the print colormount is a permanent dry mounting paper used specifically on resin coated papers but it has a very small range of adhesive temperatures too high will cause bubbles to form while too low won t make the paper stick fusion 4000 is a permanent dry mounting plastic often considered superior to the other mounting papers but when melted can become runny as a result some of the paper may transfer onto the front of the print or the print may shift choose a backing you can mount a print using dry mount paper to nearly any backing although there are some made specifically for this purpose because dry mounting is permanent in nearly all cases you need to be certain that you like the appearance of the backing you select visit a local art supply store to see the types of backing that are available or make your own with thin sheets of wood or plastic 2 x research source if you plan to have the edges of the backing act as a frame be sure that they are painted in a color you like prior to mounting the print some dry mounting paper can be purchased in package deals along with the backing board for your print cut your print to size decide if you are going to have your print bleed mounted or border mounted bleed mounted is when the backing and print are exactly the same size so there is no visible border created by the backing 3 x research source border mounting is when the backing is slightly larger than the print so as to create a border around the edge cut off all excess paper from your print in either case cut your dry mounting paper to size your dry mounting paper should be the exact same size if not only slightly smaller than the size of your print if you need to adjust the size of the sheet or roll of dry mounting paper layer your print over the top and outline it if you re worried about getting the dry mounting paper the exact same size measure it to be ⅛ inch short on every side this way there won t be any overlap and possible smearing of the heated paper prepare a clothing iron although you can use a dry mounting press to dry mount your prints they tend to be very expensive and not incredibly easy to get your hands on if you d rather take the frugal route a regular clothing iron will work perfectly 4 x research source use one that doesn t have a steam attachment or that allows you to turn the steam off as any moisture used on the dry mounting paper and print will ruin it it is best to have a separate iron to use for dry mounting from your regular clothing iron as one that you use on a regular basis is likely to be dirty or have scratches that could ruin your print instead of purchasing a brand new clothing iron look for one at a local thrift store and pay half the price just make sure the platen is clean and scratch free so that you don t damage your prints heat up your iron follow the package directions on your dry mounting paper to see what temperature is needed for the mounting process typically this should range between 160 200 f 71 93 c turn on your iron and allow it to preheat while you begin getting your print prepared for mounting line up your print paper and backing layer your print over your dry mounting paper and your chosen backing so that everything is centered make sure that none of the dry mounting paper is sticking out from under the print as this could damage the front side of your print when heated tape your print in place you will start heating the center of your print to dry mount it before you get to the edges so keep your print in place by taping the edges with painters tape or masking tape make sure the print paper and backing are all secure before you begin dry mounting because you won t be able to move them back into place once you start place a piece of blotting paper over your print although your print should withstand heat without damage direct heat from the platen of the iron could scorch or bubble the ink or paper lay a piece of blotting paper over the top of the taped in place print in order to act as a shield against damage place your iron on the center of the print the heat from the iron will glue the three layers together keeping them in place for the rest of the mounting process let the iron set without moving it on the center of the print for 3 5 minutes when the print is firmly attached to the backing you can move onto the next section 5 x research source continue mounting the corners with the iron follow the same practice as above by moving the iron to each of the corners and edges of the print and allowing it to sit and heat the dry mounting paper for 3 5 minutes moving the iron around or back and forth during this process will make it take longer for the dry mounting process to complete so just watch the paper to make sure it isn t too hot without moving it each time you are ready to move to a new corner set the iron in the center and slide it out to the corner this will remove any bubbles that might have formed under the print from the dry mounting paper un tape the sides of the print when you are ready to dry mount that area be careful not to pull the print away from the freshly mounted backing when you remove the tape finish up when your print is securely attached to the backing on all sides then the dry mounting process is complete allow it to cool for several minutes and then remove the paper at this point you are finished follow up with a picture frame for a truly completed look,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to protect acrylic paintings on canvas,when acrylic paintings aren t protected they can slowly start to become discolored cracked or warped luckily there are lots of ways to prevent this from happening you can seal your canvas with varnish protect it with a glass frame and keep it in the right environment so it stays vibrant for years with just a little bit of time and some protective measures your acrylic painting will stay as good as new,pick out a liquid varnish if your painting has a flat uniform surface liquid varnishes that you apply using a paintbrush are the most well known and are great for acrylic paintings that aren t super textured choose a liquid varnish that s designed to go over acrylic paint from your local art or big box store 1 x research source a liquid varnish will likely give your painting a glossy finish protecting it from dust dirt and other types of damage opt for an acrylic resin varnish if you want a glossy clear finish this type of varnish is super strong and great for protecting your canvas resin varnishes typically come in two liquid parts that you mix together equally before pouring it onto the canvas and spreading it evenly resin varnishes are toxic so it s best to use them in a well ventilated area 2 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source purchase a resin varnish kit from your local craft store or online if you use this type of varnish you ll want to apply an isolation coat to protect your painting select a polymer varnish for a non toxic option polymer varnishes offer a great shine and protective layer like resin though they re not quite as strong polymer varnishes are easy to apply with a paintbrush and are safer to use because they re not toxic look for a polymer varnish at your local craft store 3 x research source pick out a matte polymer varnish if desired the polymer varnish is easy to rinse out of brushes using soap and water if you re applying a an isolation coat you ll need to purchase a gloss for paint as well choose a spray varnish if your painting is textured if you have an acrylic painting that has a lot of layers or distinct textures that you want to preserve a spray varnish might be best this type of varnish comes in a can and will leave a layer of protectant over your painting without any brush marks pick out a spray varnish that works on acrylic paint 4 x research source if your acrylic painting has collage aspects or other types of media attached a spray varnish is the best choice apply an isolation coat to protect your painting in case you remove the varnish an isolation coat is often a coat of diluted gloss that separates the acrylic painting from the varnish this way if you decide to remove the varnish with a solvent you won t accidentally remove the acrylic paint too mix 2 parts of a gel gloss with 1 part water and apply this to the canvas using a paintbrush before you apply your layer of varnish 5 x research source purchase a gloss from your local craft store that s safe on acrylic paint wipe away any dust from your painting before applying the varnish use a feather duster or soft clean paintbrush to swipe away any dust on your acrylic painting this will make sure that the layer of varnish doesn t trap any dust or dirt on the painting so you get the best look 6 x research source it s also okay to use a lint free soft cloth to wipe down your painting avoid wetting the cloth to wipe down your painting because the moisture might damage the acrylics place your canvas on a flat surface to varnish it with a paintbrush if you re using a liquid varnish cover a table or other surface where you re working with plastic or layers of newspaper to protect it from the varnish set the canvas down on the table so your painting is horizontal 7 x research source clean your surface beforehand so dirt or liquids don t leak through the newspaper and onto your canvas brush the varnish onto the canvas in even layers use a flat clean paintbrush to apply the varnish dipping the brush into the liquid and wiping the excess off against the side of the can brush the varnish onto the canvas using even strokes start at the top left of the canvas and brush the varnish on using even strokes moving to the far right of the canvas before working your way down 8 x research source applying multiple thin layers of the varnish instead of one thick one is best so you get even coverage follow the instructions on your can of varnish to make sure you apply it correctly hold a can of varnish 12 in 30 cm away from the painting to spray it shake the can of varnish before you spray it so its contents are well combined spray the varnish across the canvas starting at the top of the painting and going from left to right in even rows for extra protection spray 2 3 layers of the varnish onto the canvas 9 x research source choose a well ventilated area to spray your varnish continue shaking the can every couple of minutes as you re spraying the canvas holding the spray 1 ft 0 30 m from the canvas will make sure the varnish isn t too concentrated in one area let the acrylic painting dry for several days in a dust free space your specific type of varnish will tell you how long it takes to dry but it s best to let your painting sit for a few days just to be safe make sure your painting is drying in an area that isn t super dusty or dirty so the dust doesn t get into the drying varnish 10 x research source dust your acrylic painting with a feather duster to keep it clean swipe the feather duster gently over the canvas to get rid of any dust moving from side to side evenly to be sure you clean the entire surface the feather duster is gentle enough that it won t damage your acrylic painting 11 x research source a large sable brush a soft bristled paintbrush will work as a duster too bring your painting to a professional art cleaner if it s super dirty or you re worried about damaging it avoid touching your painting with your fingers the oils on your skin can damage your acrylic painting over time causing it to do things like discolor as you re cleaning your painting be careful that you don t touch its surface with your fingers to keep it in great shape 12 x research source keep your artwork away from bright sunlight lots of exposure to the sun will make your acrylic painting fade over time so the colors aren t as vibrant when you hang your painting choose a spot on the wall that gets less sunlight to keep the canvas in good shape 13 x research source for example avoid placing the painting on the wall that s facing a sunny window cover your painting in glass so it s in a protective frame placing a frame with glass in it will protect your acrylic painting from dust and dirt as well as any accidental touches if you re worried about sun damage opt for a uv protected plastic that looks similar to glass so your painting won t fade as easily 14 x research source keep your painting out of areas that are super dry or very humid humidity can cause your painting to warp while air that s very dry can cause cracking or other damage if the place where you re putting the canvas is humid use a dehumidifier to take the excess moisture out of the air while a humidifier will help a super dry space 15 x research source an ideal humidity for the canvas is 55 if you re not sure what the humidity is in your space purchase a hygrometer from a big box or home improvement store that will tell you store your acrylic painting in a cool dark place if you re not hanging the acrylic painting at the moment place it in an area that doesn t get too much sunlight and that s cool in temperature hotter temperatures can cause damage to the canvas like warping 16 x research source if you re storing more than one acrylic painting together place something between them like a clean board so they re not directly touching bring your acrylic painting to a professional if you notice signs of aging these signs might be things like discoloration warping or cracks in the paint instead of trying to fix these problems yourself take your canvas to a professional painting restorer so they can take good care of your canvas 17 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to pack paintings,if you need to transport paintings you have to be extra careful to avoid damaging them and ruining their value whether you re moving to a new house sending the painting to a gallery or transporting it home after buying it the prep techniques are the same start by protecting the painting from moisture and dirt with a layer of glassine paper then cushion the paper with multiple layers of bubble wrap or a similar packaging material load the painting into a box that matches its dimensions so it doesn t bounce around finally tape up the box and send it out for shipping,make an x across the glass with masking tape if the painting is framed if the glass breaks during the moving process it can destroy the painting making an x prevents the glass from shattering completely if it breaks protecting the painting use masking tape or painter s tape sticky tape like duct or packing tape will leave remnants behind and could ruin the glass 1 x research source if your painting isn t framed then skip this step don t let any tape touch the painting itself you can also remove the painting from its frame for moving and follow this process to pack an unframed painting lay a blanket on a table to cushion the painting while you work don t let your painting directly touch a hard surface cushion it with some padding a thick blanket or sheet will work lay this down on the surface you re working on 2 x research source make sure anything you use is clean if you have foam or something like that this will also work anything that pads the painting and prevents it from pressing on a hard surface is fine if you re wrapping a larger painting then spread the padding out on the floor instead of a table don t work on a table too small for your painting or it could fall over cut a layer of glassine paper 2 in 5 1 cm longer than the sides of the canvas measure out a sheet that leaves about 2 inches 5 1 cm on each side of the painting so it wraps around the canvas cut the paper to the correct size if you have to for especially wide paintings you may need to lay 2 sheets side by side 3 x research source glassine paper is a non stick material that protects the painting from moisture and dirt it is available online or from craft stores if you don t have glassine paper don t use wax paper as a substitute this could stick to your painting for short trips or less valuable paintings the glassine isn t crucial just be sure to unwrap your paintings as soon as you arrive at the location if your painting isn t framed or canvassed cut 2 pieces of cardboard the same size as the painting then sandwich the painting between these 2 pieces instead of using glassine lay the painting face down on the glassine paper don t press it down or apply any pressure just gently lay it down in the center of the paper 4 x research source cut away some of the paper if it s too long remember to leave about 2 inches 5 1 cm of glassine on each side tape the glassine paper to the back of the canvas with artist tape fold the glassine over the side of the canvas so it reaches the back of the painting use a small strip of artist tape to attach it to the wooden part of the canvas fold the remaining 3 sides and tape them the same way 5 x research source only use artist tape for this step any other type of sticky tape could damage the painting glassine isn t necessary for paintings that aren t framed or canvas you can add it for an extra layer of security if you prefer get a box that leaves 2 in 5 1 cm of space on all sides of the painting this empty space allows enough room for cushioning measure your painting s perimeter then find a box that allows 2 in 5 1 cm of cushion space on all sides 6 x research source plan to use one box per painting unless you have a specialized box for transporting multiple paintings if you can t find a box the right size you can always cut one to the correct size or make your own out of sheets of cardboard place cardboard on each corner if the painting is framed this extra layer of protection prevents the wooden frame from being damaged either get cardboard corners from the store or make your own out of cardboard scraps 7 x research source to make cardboard corners cut 2 strips of cardboard the width of the painting tape them together to make a corner then cut 2 cardboard triangles and place their corners at the joint where the 2 cardboard strips meet tape up the whole shape and slide it onto the corner of the painting make 3 more to cover all 4 corners you can also do this if the painting isn t framed it s not crucial but if the painting is very valuable then it would be a good idea measure the depth of the box you re using this tells you how much padding the box requires to prevent the painting from bouncing around measure the box depth then subtract the width of the painting the result is how much padding you need on each side 8 x research source for example if the box is 8 inches 20 cm deep and the painting has a width of 3 inches 7 6 cm then it needs 2 5 inches 6 4 cm of padding on each side wrap the painting with bubble wrap until it reaches the box depth lay out a sheet of bubble wrap with the flat side facing up place the painting on top and begin rolling it in bubble wrap measure every few layers to see how thick the package is stop when it reaches the depth of the box 9 x research source make sure only the flat side of the bubble wrap touches the painting the bubbled side could leave impressions on the painting rolls of bubble wrap are usually cheap check online or at an office supply store if you don t have this much bubble wrap then wrap the painting with 2 bubble wrap layers then use blankets styrofoam or a similar padding material to fill out the rest of the box fold all the edges of the bubble wrap and secure them with packing tape start at the end of the painting roll the remaining bubble wrap towards the painting and tape it down then apply a strip of tape along any bubble wrap edges to prevent them from getting caught during the moving process 10 x research source it s okay to use packing tape at this point because none of the tape will touch the painting directly don t use masking or artist tape for this task these aren t sticky enough and the wrap could come loose slide the painting into the box carefully position the box so the open side faces up then take the painting and lower it into the box work gently so you don t slam the painting onto the ground 11 x research source work with another person for larger paintings if you find that the painting doesn t fit remove it and take off a few layers of bubble wrap try again and see if it fits now test the box to make sure the painting doesn t shift or rattle before taping up the box make sure the painting has enough padding pick the box up and shake it a little if you hear the painting sliding around then it may not have enough padding take it out and add some more bubble wrap or packing material then test it again 12 x research source use duct or packing tape on all the sides of the box in case you slide it first use packing tape and seal up the box opening then tape up all 4 sides of the box this prevents the box from ripping open if the movers slide it around during transport 13 x research source don t use painter s tape for this because it is too weak to protect the box or keep it closed mark the box as fragile professional movers are always careful with that they transport but make sure they know that a fragile item is in this box so they re extra careful write fragile on every side of the box in red marker so it s easy to spot 14 x research source if you re transporting several paintings also label the box with the painting inside this will make unpacking much easier while a paper painting without canvas may be less fragile still mark the box as fragile it s still a valuable item,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to remove a painting from a frame,sometimes it is necessary to reframe a painting due to its value uniqueness or in order to transport it compactly instead of throwing away the work of art removing and reframing can give a picture a renewed display time,assess the damage to the painting if serious you may need to hire a professional restorer examine the front and back of the frame determine the method of attachment removal is reversal of assembly 1 x research source note which staples go to which part of the assembly remove staples nails or screws from back of frame 2 x research source it is not necessary to take out the staples holding the stretcher bar itself use pliers to remove the staples if they don t come out easily 3 x research source continue around the back of the picture smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb b b9 img_3623_208 jpg 460px img_3623_208 jpg bigurl images thumb b b9 img_3623_208 jpg 728px img_3623_208 jpg smallwidth 460 smallheight 345 bigwidth 728 bigheight 546 licensing div class mw parser output p author took photo 1 08 pliers removing staple from frame n p p image by uploader br nlicense a rel nofollow class external text href https creativecommons org licenses by 3 0 creative commons a n p div carefully wedge in the screwdriver to get a grip on the spline remove the spline from all the way around the painting pull any staples nails found holding the canvas to the frame being careful not to rip the canvas material too much it may need to be re attached to another stretcher bar if the current one is not reusable gently push the canvas backward or frame forward to separate from each other slowly poke under the canvas 4 x research source the wood stretcher bar holds the canvas giving it shape there is a crevice into which the spline used to fit pinching the canvas taut this is the same principle a screen door uses continue around the edge of the frame picture there may be many years that the canvas has been pressed folded it is not glued to the wood but may be stuck slightly if transporting carefully roll up around a foam cylinder and place in sturdy carton 5 x research source wrap loosely so paint does not chip and break off,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to preserve expensive oil paintings,valuable oil paintings are only as valuable as the condition they re in it s important that if you ve inherited or acquired an expensive oil painting that you take the proper steps in preserving it while many of these steps are easy to do it s important to note that restoration or repair should be handled strictly by a professional,dust your painting twice a year use a natural hair artist s brush or japanese brush when dusting tilt your painting forward on a clean padded surface so that the dust rolls down once your painting is safely secured dust it in a back and forth motion until you ve cleaned the entire painting do not dust your painting if the paint is chipping or cracking 1 x research source do not use conventional feather dusters or rough cloths to prevent scratches don t use water sprays or cleaners that may interact with the varnish or paint store your paintings in a dry room wrapped in tissue paper moisture can destroy and warp a painting and its frame so it s important that you store paintings carefully use tissue paper breathable sheets or foam to protect your oil paintings while you store them avoid using material like bubble wrap because it can trap moisture in 2 x research source make sure that the painting has air circulation store it in an area that is not prone to bugs animals or dust hire a professional to clean and preserve your paintings this is especially important if your painting is damaged flaking cracking or peeling painting conservators have years of experience and will be able to preserve and restore your painting without affecting its value they can also give you additional tips on preservation while you store or display the painting at home to find a licensed conservator visit the website for the american institute for conservation of historic and artistic works or the aic 3 x research source re varnish your painting before re varnishing a painting make sure you consult with a professional so they can advise you varnish protects the paint in your art by locking out dirt and dust it also evens out the appearance of oil paintings 4 x research source use a flat varnishing brush and apply the varnish from the top working your way down the oil painting in a crisscross pattern use a flat surface to work on and don t apply the varnish vertically make sure to cover the entire painting and let it dry in a warm dust free room 5 x research source virtually all oil paintings are varnished and over time need to be re varnished handle one painting at a time each painting requires its own special attention to avoid damaging it in any way avoid stacking paintings on top of each other when moving or storing them as this can easily damage them and reduce their value 6 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source if a painting is too large for you to move yourself have a friend help never lean your painting against a sharp object or something that could scratch it hold the art by the frame when moving a painting if you are transporting a painting wash your hands and avoid touching the surface of the art 7 x research source use both hands and lift the painting by the frame with your hands securely centered on each side of the frame the natural oils in your hands can leave fingerprints and damage a painting s value 8 x research source remove jewelry or other sharp accessories that could scratch the painting hanging jewelry or wearing other sharp stones could potentially scratch or poke the surface of your painting 9 x research source poking the backside of a canvass can create a bulge that will create spider web cracks along the surface of your art 10 x research source fix improper framing and replace missing keys a faulty frame could cause the painting to fall out of your hands and get damaged frame keys are small triangular wedges that regulate the dimensions of the stretcher frame and can fall out over time make sure to replace these by inserting new ones if they fall out 11 x research source you can buy framing keys at most art stores you can have your art re framed by a conservator with brass mending plates and screws for extra security and longevity 12 x research source keep your painting out of direct sunlight and heat do not hang your painting over a direct heat source like a radiator hot water pipes fire or in direct sunlight as this can destroy your painting exposing your paintings to heat could create cracking and blistering keep the temperature at 70 75 degrees fahrenheit 21 24 degrees celsius 13 x research source keep humidity and moisture away avoid areas with high moisture or humidity like a damp basement attic bathroom or kitchen damp areas could cause mold to grow on your art which will need to be removed by a professional keep the humidity level between 40 and 60 14 x research source purchasing a dehumidifier can help you regulate humidity in your house prevent extended exposure to ultraviolet light uv lights are used to inspect paintings for restoration work but should not be used over prolonged periods of time 15 x research source the reflection of the uv light on the surface of the painting can create cracking or lifting when you re inspecting your expensive painting make sure that when you re done you turn off all the uv lights that were used to inspect it certain dyes and colorants used in oil paint will fade and dull over time if exposed to uv lights 16 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source use painting hooks screwed into wood studs never screw your painting into the wall using drywall use a stud finder to find wooden studs then use painting hooks to secure your painting to the wall make sure that it s secure and doesn t tilt or move to one side the painting hooks will prevent the art from falling which could damage your art and your wall make sure to use a tape measure and level when hanging art never drill directly into the frame unless you have frame screws do not use nails with your expensive art display your painting under plexiglass or glass a glass or plexiglass encasement is an added precaution you can take when displaying valuable paintings this will preserve them from dust or any unwanted fingerprints that may occur in an open area 17 x research source museum grade glass and certain plexiglass also come with uv filtering to prevent the painting from being damaged from prolonged exposure to sunlight 18 x research source regular glass is heavier and easier to break but plexiglass is a polymer that may interact with your oil painting

how to mail artwork,whether you re selling your own work assisting a gallery dealing with an estate or relocating there are times when shipping art is an unavoidable procedure even experienced artists often find themselves intimidated by the prospect of mailing valuable unique artwork not to worry a few simple steps will help you ship your artwork safely professionally and confidently 1 x research source,buy supplies a few dedicated supplies will help the process of transporting your artwork go much more smoothly especially if you plan on shipping art frequently you ll need glassine or acid free paper bubble wrap lots of it insulated foam or thick cardboard packing tape high quality if possible tape gun artist tape cardboard corner protectors determine an appropriate box size a good rule of thumb is to have about 2 inches of clearance on each side of your artwork that means adding 4 inches 10cm for each dimension to get an ideal box size so if a painting is 16 x 16 x 1 an ideal box size would be 20 x 20 x 5 2 x research source buy a box you can get boxes from shipping companies or stores like staples wal mart or home depot you ll want to use a box that s pretty close to the ideal size you determined so don t count on finding a free one lying around make sure you have at least 1 inch of clearance on all sides you ultimately want your package to be quite snug so don t round up too much use wide artist tape on framed artwork apply tape in a star pattern to the frame s glass this will ensure that even if your glass breaks during transit it won t harm the artwork itself 3 x research source four strips covering the length of the piece is usually sufficient use a few more strips for larger pieces the smaller your uncovered patches of glass are the better don t worry about this step if your artwork is unframed cover the front with glassine cut a sheet of glassine slightly larger than your artwork such that you ll have enough extra on each side to fold over the edge 2 inches is typically sufficient gently lay your work face down on the sheet fold the glassine up over each edge and secure it to the back of your painting with artist tape try to tape to the glassine itself rather than the piece similar to gift wrapping 4 x research source for larger pieces you may have to use multiple sheets of glassine ensure the entire front of your piece is covered snugly by at least one sheet of glassine don t worry about covering the back side if you don t have glassine any acid free tissue paper should do in a pinch you can use a garbage bag 5 x research source sandwich your piece in foam or cardboard cut two sheets of insulated foam or two ply cardboard slightly larger than your artwork an inch of extra room on each side is plenty sandwich your artwork between these two sheets 6 x research source tape the bottom and sides of the cardboard together so that the foam stays put it s possible to skip this step but it s a good idea if you desire extra protection especially with framed artwork use bubble wrap generously cover your entire piece with two layers of bubble wrap at the minimum use packing tape to secure the wrap bubble wrap is your primary means of keeping your artwork safe so be generous if there is extra wrap on the sides of your artwork fold it over and tape along the edges to provide extra protection 7 x research source a large roll of bubble wrap makes this process much easier consider investing in one if you plan to ship artwork often keep the size of your box in mind when deciding how much bubble wrap to use a snug fit is ideal box it slide your wrapped artwork into your box if available use cardboard corner protectors for added protection fill empty space with additional bubble wrap making sure to eliminate any extra space in your box 8 x research source you want to ensure that your work won t be bouncing around inside of your box when in doubt add more bubble wrap tape your box use high quality tape and a taping gun if possible cover all the seams of your box entirely if desired apply tape around the length and width of your package to add more rigidity think of tape as your first line of defense try not to leave any snags that could potentially tear 9 x research source double check the address providing an incorrect address or using incorrect postage will lead to the package being returned this means extra shipping increasing the chances for the piece to be damaged save yourself some hassle by double checking everything add warning labels shipping companies have different protocols on how to label packages as fragile it s a good idea to supplement with your own label packages as glass encourages better handling mail handlers will be more worried about the item potentially breaking 10 x research source use large easily noticeable type 11 x research source decide on a shipping company there s no clear answer on which shipping company is kindest with fragile packages 12 x research source you re better off prioritizing cost and convenience when deciding which shipping company to go with if you re using the us postal service priority mail costs slightly more but is much faster than parcel post 13 x research source you can also consider their flat rate boxes when their sizes are appropriate buy shipping insurance this is usually a no brainer for valuable artwork no matter how careful you are accidents do happen shipping insurance is almost always a worthwhile investment,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to store art,whether you collect art as a hobby or have a studio of your own you may eventually need to place your artwork in storage to properly protect and store your artwork you have to choose a storage environment and packing materials that won t cause premature aging or damage handle all work with care,pick a room that s as dark as possible light is one of artwork s biggest enemies it can cause all sorts of damage so you want to store your art in a dark place choose a windowless room such as a finished basement or study to store your artwork 1 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source keep the room at a temperature of about 70 f 21 c for most artworks a steady cool temperature is ideal more extreme climates can crack paint warp or yellow paper and foster mold growth 2 x research source if the room you ve selected goes through drastic changes in temperature during different seasons you should pick another location to store your art if you are not storing art in your home your next best option is a storage unit give nearby storage companies a call and ask if they have temperature controlled units available if you have a local art gallery near you you can call and ask them for recommended storage services 3 x research source maintain a humidity of 50 in the storage room materials like paint and wood are especially sensitive to humidity keeping a constant moderate level of humidity in the storage area will keep your artwork from changing shape or getting moldy 4 x research source you can moderate the room s humidity using a humidifier or dehumidifier 5 x research source put on gloves before touching any art some art materials are hypersensitive even to the natural oils on your fingertips wearing cotton or powder free latex gloves when handling your art can prevent you from accidentally causing it harm 6 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source check to see if all works are dry if you re storing any paintings sculptures or ceramics make sure they re

how to clean a painting,paintings are a lovely addition to any home but keeping them clean can be a challenge unlike other pieces of decor paintings can t be cleaned with the wipe of a dusting cloth fortunately you can clean dirt and dust from your paintings with minimal risk of damage the best way to clean oil acrylic and watercolor paintings is to brush away dirt and dust with a soft bristle paint brush for stubborn dirt on oil or acrylic paintings you can use saliva as a paint friendly cleaning solvent if your paintings are valuable old damaged or pastels however it s a good idea to call in the professionals,rest your painting on a soft surface with the painting upright this ensures that the dirt and dust will fall away from the painting as you dust it increases the likelihood that you ll be able to remove debris rather than just redistribute it if you can have someone else help you hold the painting steady 1 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source for example you could drape a soft throw blanket over a chair then set the painting on it the back of the chair will help you keep the painting upright select a new soft bristle paint brush with clean dry bristles your brush should have a wide base and flat shape look for natural bristles as they are softer and finer 2 x research source the ideal brush size for cleaning dust is 3 5 to 5 centimetres 1 4 to 2 0 in you can use brush cleaning for oil acrylic and watercolor 3 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source you can attempt to clean pastels using the brush method but you may damage the artwork as pastels are easily altered for oil and pastel paintings choose a brush labeled for oil painting for acrylic paintings choose a brush labeled for acrylic paintings for watercolor paintings use a watercolor brush it s especially important that the brush be dry never use dust cloths feather dusters or stiff bristles to clean a painting even a soft cloth or duster can damage the painting 4 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source work from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner starting at the corner ensures that you brush the entire surface of the painting simply work in straight lines moving from 1 corner to another then move down the painting in sections that are no larger than the width of your brush 5 x research source this will be the corner that is on your left as you face the painting make small gentle brush strokes moving horizontally it s best to make several little strokes as you move across the surface of the painting hold your brush above the painting never pressing down the bristles should lightly graze the surface 6 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source if you press down on the brush you could leave a mark in the paint horizontal strokes go back and forth repeat the brushing process making vertical strokes return to the top left corner then start working in a downward motion your first pass should go from the top left corner to the bottom left corner continue working across the surface of the painting until you ve dusted all of it 7 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source vertical strokes go up and down use spit to clean paintings with stubborn dust or dirt it may seem gross but saliva is commonly used by museums and historians to keep paintings clean 8 x research source saliva contains enzymes that break down dirt and dust but it s also gentle enough that it doesn t harm the paint not only is saliva the perfect solvent for cleaning your painting it s also free 9 x research source cleaning with saliva can take a while so make sure that you re committed to the project it will likely take several hours at the minimum you can use spit cleaning for acrylic or oil paintings but never use it for watercolors or pastels don t eat or drink for at least 30 minutes before using your saliva food and drinks can alter the chemistry of your saliva making it possible your painting could be damaged they could also color your saliva or add food particles if you do need to take a snack break wait 30 minutes before adding new saliva to your bowl when you need to take a drink so that you can make more saliva water is a safe option just make sure you don t spit any water into your saliva bowl 10 x research source collect your spit in a small bowl this will make it easier to clean the painting once you get started fill the bowl with as much spit as you reasonably can which will mean spitting several times 11 x research source you can add more spit to the bowl later so don t worry if you don t produce much right now test the saliva on a lower corner to check the effect although saliva is very safe you still want to see how it ll work on your painting before you make noticeable changes choose a small spot on a lower corner to try it out lightly dab the corner with a cotton swab dipped in the saliva check the results to make sure they match your expectations 12 x research source make sure that the saliva didn t alter the paint in any way for example it shouldn t be flaking and shouldn t have marks on it check that the dust and debris are gone dip a cotton swab in the saliva then wipe away dirt and dust make small gentle swipes along the surface of the painting the cotton should barely touch the surface of the painting as you don t want to leave an impression 13 x research source if any dirt and dust remain you can make a second pass continue to use gentle pressure you ll need to have a lot of patience as the cleaning process can take a lot of time work in 1 inch 2 5 cm sections until the entire painting is clean focusing on small sections at a time will help you make sure that you successfully clean the entire painting it will also help you avoid becoming overwhelmed 14 x research source you can adjust the size of your sections if you need to for example you might want to work in very small sections if the painting is very dirty use both ends of the cotton swab then get a new swab when a cotton swab starts to look dirty you need to switch to a clean swab expect to go through many cotton swabs as you clean the painting 15 x research source it s best to start with a full or mostly full box of cotton swabs you won t use all of them but you ll be sure that you have enough obtain art insurance on the piece before getting it cleaned in the unlikely event that your painting is damaged by the conservator insurance will protect you from financial loss you can add fine art insurance onto your homeowner s policy or you can take out a policy from a company specializing in fine art insurance they ll ask for proof that the art work is yours and then you ll need to get an appraisal to estimate the current value of the work you can prove ownership with a bill of sale or other legal documents you should get your artwork appraised every 3 5 years to make sure your policy reflects its current value insurance can also cover your painting during transportation just check with your insurer to make sure your policy offers this coverage 16 x research source take valuable notable or older pieces to a professional conservator although getting a painting cleaned by a professional conservator can be pricey it can save you a lot of heartache if the painting needs special attention it s easy to damage a painting especially if it s already old a professional conservator is trained in the best practices for preserving and cleaning artwork which limits the risk of harm 17 x research source for example if you own an expensive original painting from a famous artist it s best to get it professionally cleaned similarly you ll need to hire a conservationist if your watercolor painting has damage other than dust for example they can remove mold from the painting 18 x trustworthy source american library association oldest library nonprofit association in the world dedicated to promoting libraries and library education internationally go to source keep in mind that an art conservator is different from an artist or a curator don t turn your painting over to anyone without properly checking their credentials contact the nearest art museum or art school to get a referral an art museum or art school should be able to put you in contact with a qualified conservator in some cases the person may work at the museum or school preserving the artwork in their holdings going through a museum or art school will give you confidence that the person knows what they re doing 19 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source if you don t know of any art museums nearby do an internet search you can also do a simple search for art conservators select a conservator experienced with the type of painting you possess ask them about their education work history and specializations then look at examples of their past work ideally they should have experience in handling artwork from a similar time period to yours and in the same medium 20 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source for example you wouldn t want to have a classical renaissance painting restored by someone who only has experience working with contemporary art allow the conservator to evaluate the painting and create a plan each painting has its own issues so every professional cleaning process will be different the conservator will evaluate the quality of the paint existing damage and the presence of varnish that may be protecting the paint they can also determine if prior restoration efforts have been done after their evaluation they ll provide you with a restoration plan 21 x research source in many cases they will look at the paint under a uv light to check the varnish and paint layers at the very least the conservator will remove debris it s likely that they will also remove the top layer of varnish if the painting has other damage such as tears or flaking paint the conservator will repair these as well they may even touch up the paint with your approval 22 x trustworthy source the smithsonian institution leading group of museums and research institution funded by the u s government go to source ask the conservator to get approval from you before they begin this can protect you from unwanted changes or a high bill have them explain what they want to do to your painting such as removing the varnish or touching up paint next check the proposed fee make sure that you are happy with everything before you approve the plan 23 x research source if a painting needs minimal cleaning conservation may cost a few hundred dollars if it requires more work costs for a small painting may range from 800 1 000 a larger painting that has damage may cost as much as 10 000 15 000 to conserve and restore most conservationists are paid by the hour and will not disclose costs until they can evaluate a painting additionally x rays of the painting add to the cost 24 x

how to light artwork on a wall,when it comes to wall art lighting can make all the difference choosing an appropriate lighting fixture can give your wall art the perfect spotlight it needs to stand out the type of bulb and the temperature of its light will also make a difference bright white lights can add a more modern gallery like aesthetic to your home while warmer more yellow lights can provide a cozy intimate feel how you display the artwork on the wall can complement and elevate your design scheme while ensuring the artwork s colors stay vivid over time,install track lighting for flexibility and a modern industrial look track lights can slide along the installation beam which is useful if you regularly change your art display or decide to move your art pieces around on the same wall you ll need to consider the height of your ceiling before you install the track lighting to ensure the light hits the artwork at a 30 degree angle 1 x research source if your ceilings are 8 feet 2 4 m high install the track 24 inches 61 cm away from the wall where the art is hanging for a ceiling 10 feet 3 0 m high the track should be 33 inches 84 cm away from the wall for a ceiling 12 feet 3 7 m high place the track 51 inches 130 cm away from the wall use a wall washer with multiple bulbs to evenly illuminate a large piece a wall washer is a long strip of several small lights in a single unit washers are great for lighting wall art because each bulb ensures even light is projected onto the piece you can either mount them from the ceiling near where it meets the wall or from the wall itself about 8 inches 20 cm to 12 inches 30 cm above the top of the artwork 2 x research source wall washers mounted from the ceiling directly above the artwork are ideal for lighting artwork with lots of texture if you want to use recessed washers in the ceiling take the height into count for example if you have 8 ft 2 4 m ceilings mount the washing fixture 18 inches 46 cm to 24 inches 61 cm away from the wall so the light hits the artwork at a 30 degree angle mount a picture light on top of art frames for an intimate viewing experience picture lights can be more inviting and cozy which is ideal for a small den or family room they typically use low wattage lamps that will invite you to stand closer to the piece to look at it a picture light won t work if the art doesn t have a sturdy frame that you can attach it to 3 x research source if you re a renter this is a great option because it doesn t require cutting or drilling holes in the ceiling note that some picture lamps have cords so you ll need an outlet nearby other types require batteries typically aaa size that you ll need to replace as necessary the shade size of the picture light lamp should be at least 1 2 the width of the artwork e g do not use a picture lamp that s less than 12 inches 30 cm long for a painting that s 24 inches 61 cm wide 4 x research source mimic a professional gallery with bright white halogen lights most art galleries and museums use halogen lights because of their high color rendering index cri which is a number that determines how correctly a light brings out the true color of an object halogen lights typically score the highest with a cri of 95 to 100 5 x research source one downside to halogen bulbs is that they get extremely hot so it s important to keep them away from flammable materials and the painting itself halogen bulbs have an average lifespan of 2 000 hours so you ll need to replace them more often depending on how long you leave them on each day halogen bulbs are a great choice if you plan to install track lighting because it will be far enough from the painting to provide a spotlight and not so close that the heat might damage the painting use led bulbs to showcase oil paintings while using less energy many galleries use led bulbs because they emit a diffused more uniform light that won t cause uneven streaks and highlights on oil paintings they re the most energy efficient bulb and last 10 000 to 25 000 hours the longest lifespan of any type of bulb 6 x research source led lights come in a variety of temperatures from warm white light to cool white and daylight consider using a dimmable led bulb if you like the flexibility of highlighting or lowlighting your artwork choose an incandescent bulb for a warm yellow light incandescent bulbs will highlight the red yellow gold and orange tones in an art piece which can also create a flattering contrast for blues and greens they re perfect for accenting artwork in a cozy bedroom den or dining room 7 x research source incandescent bulbs typically come in 60 70 or 100 watt varieties so choose a wattage that s higher than the other bulbs in the room to make the art piece pop a disadvantage is that incandescent bulbs aren t considered environmentally friendly they produce a lot of heat decreasing their already short lifespan of 750 to 1 000 hours and emit carbon dioxide flatter cool toned artwork with compact fluorescent light cfl bulbs cfl bulbs are the more energy efficient version of traditional fluorescent and incandescent lights a 23 watt cfl bulb will emit the same amount of light as a 100 watt incandescent bulb the light tends to be on the cooler side which is perfect if you have paintings with a lot of cool colors like green blue and purple 8 x research source while they can be more expensive than regular fluorescent bulbs they ll last about 9 000 hours cfl bulbs also come in low color temperature ranges that emit warmer yellowish light that flatters paintings with warm colors red orange and yellow hues a disadvantage of cfl bulbs is that they have a relatively low cri compared to other bulbs 50 to 90 meaning it won t render the colors as true as they re meant to be note that cfl bulbs emit a small number of uv rays so it s best to only use cfl bulbs with art that s framed with uv filtering plexiglass pick a color temperature that complements the colors of the artwork the color temperature of the bulb is reported in kelvins look at the painting and assess whether you want to highlight the warm or cool tones that is red yellow and orange hues versus gree blue and purple tones look at the bulb s package to determine it s kelvin value 9 x research source a low range 2700 to 3000k emit a warmer light much like incandescent bulbs and will enhance red and yellow tones cool colors might look a little dull under this type of light higher values 3500 to 6500k give off a brighter white light that will bring out blues and greens in the artwork at a very high level reds yellows and oranges might look slightly distorted place the artwork on a wall that isn t exposed to sunlight sunlight can cause colors to dull over time so hang your artwork on an interior wall that doesn t get any sunlight throughout the day if this isn t an option use curtains to protect your artwork from the strong morning and afternoon light 10 x research source another option is to frame the artwork with uv filtering acrylic plexiglass instead of regular glass for unframed paintings purchase uv protecting varnish from any art supply store and spray it onto the painting adjust the light so it hits the art at a 30 degree angle whether you re using recessed pendants or surface mounted lights the light should hit the artwork at a 30 degree angle increase the angle to 35 degrees to highlight any textural aspects of the art just don t go over a 45 degree angle because it will cause a distracting glare either from the frame s glass or the from the artwork s varnish 11 x research source lighting a piece from a 10 degree angle is too close and may end up casting shadows onto the art if you re using a picture light choose one that sticks out a little from the painting so it s not being lit from directly overhead however feel free to break the 30 degree rule if you like the look of direct overhead lighting on a particular piece of art hang artwork at eye level or 57 inches 140 cm from the center to the floor galleries and museums abide by this rule because it s the most comfortable viewing angle for most people use a tape measure and pencil to mark a spot 57 inches 140 cm from the floor hold the painting up to the wall to determine where exactly you need to hang it so that point meets the center of the painting 12 x research source note that you will not be putting the nail into the center marking you ll need to make a hole higher on the wall depending on the length of the wire hanger if you re hanging artwork over a couch the bottom of the painting should be 8 inches 20 cm to 10 inches 25 cm above the back of the couch however feel free to break this rule as you like by leaning a tall painting against the wall hanging a small painting over a doorway or hanging it higher to create the illusion of tall ceilings 13 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment

pen diagonally at a 30 to 60 degree angle a calligraphy pen isn t used quite the same way as a regular pen the tip or nib of the pen should point diagonally away from you to the left as you write 1 x research source don t twist the nib as you write the tip of writing tool used to do calligraphy is called a nib regardless of the letters you are forming the orientation of the nib should remain consistent whether you re doing straight lines or loops the tip of the nib should always point in the same direction 2 x research source lead the nib backwards or sideways across the paper the nib should move backwards or sideways from the direction it s pointing in pushing it forward away from your hand leads to blotting and uneven letter formation 3 x research source apply light pressure using too much pressure can make for messy letters or scratches in your paper pressing too hard can also damage the nib so do your best to apply the pen to the paper with a light consistent pressure try not to lean heavily on your hand or forearm either which creates stilted lettering 4 x research source keep your lines parallel vertical horizontal and diagonal lines in various letters should be parallel to corresponding lines in other letters this will make your writing look more consistent and professional 5 x research source for instance try to make the vertical line the letter d parallel with the vertical line in the letter b trace the alphabet numerous times select and print a sample calligraphy alphabet and cover it with a piece of tracing paper try to recreate the strokes of the alphabet letters until you can successfully write the letters on your own 6 x research source use the correct stroke order each letter or symbol will be made up of several different sections which are done in a single movement called strokes practice upward and downward strokes until you can make them consistent keep in mind that when writing letters the stroke order is also important and differs by style so refer to a calligraphy guide to learn which strokes come first based on the letter 7 x research source for instance in western calligraphy write vertical lines first followed by horizontal lines such as when writing the letter t 8 x research source in asian calligraphy strokes begin at the top of the character and move downward to the to bottom of the character 9 x research source for islamic calligraphy begin with the largest strokes of the letter and progress to the smallest strokes and dots 10 x research source try the grid method set up a grid to practice with by filling a piece of paper with 1 inch 2 5 cm squares use pencil to make the grid then fill in each row with repeated versions of whichever letter you wish to practice until your strokes are even and clean looking 11 x research source use templates to perfect your spacing calligraphy templates will help you master letter formation and keep your spacing consistent they also keep your letters and words from slanting up or down across the page do an internet search for free guids or templates or pick up a calligraphy guidebook to practice with 12 x research source practice freehand once you get the hang of how to form calligraphy letters practice writing notes messages or journal entries in calligraphy anything you need to write down can be done so in calligraphy to get you used to connecting

you place in your pen or pots in which case you fill the pen yourself ink sticks which will also require an ink stone are sticks of ink which must be ground and mixed with water in order to form the ink you will write with they are an excellent option for calligraphers because they allow you to get many different tones from the same ink depending on how it is mixed these are often used in asian calligraphy use rulers or other guide instruments for consistency you may want rulers or t guides to create guidelines for yourself and ensure that your writing is straight or perhaps you wish to write across a curved or circular line and need a reference even experts use rulers and other guide instruments to make their writing as beautiful and consistent as possible 17 x research source keep your paper in place with tape or weights use painter s tape or weights to hold the paper in place while you are writing this will keep you from skewing or bumping the paper and messing up your letters

how to write with a calligraphy pen,calligraphy is writing style that has flourished over thousands of years in many different cultures around the world whether you are an artist a writer or just a hobbyist learning to write with a calligraphy pen is a valuable and rewarding skill,understand the four most common types of calligraphy pens each pen has a different type of ink and ink is one of the most important elements of writing calligraphy well choosing a calligraphy pen is a highly personal decision as the ink must be suitable for calligraphy the pen must fit your hand well and you must be comfortable writing with it there are four types of pens that are considered ideal for calligraphy including 1 x research source felt tip pens these are good for beginners as they are cheap easy to use and do not require you to prepare the ink before use however felt tip pens tend to run out of ink fast and the ink can soak through the paper or your writing surface these pens are good for practice but should not be used for important documents or works of art fountain pens these are commonly used by intermediate and advanced calligraphers these pens contain changeable nibs and ink cartridges the ink feeds into a nib and is fed on to the page via the slit in the nib dip pens these pens are used by advanced calligraphers but they can be used by beginners with patience and practice dip pens consist of three components the handle nib holder or shaft which is what the calligrapher grips when she writes the nib which is usually made of metal and has a slit which releases the ink and the reservoir which is the small cup or depression that feeds the slit some reservoirs sit on the top of the nib and some sit underneath the nib the reservoir holds a small supply of ink for the nib so you can write several lines or letters before replenishing the ink brush pens these pens consist of a thin brush between 6mm to 20mm wide with a head made of nylon or sable the brush head should be made of short and stiff bristles to give you more control over the lines as you will need to dip the brush into the ink to write writing calligraphy with a square brush is different than using a pen with a nib as the brush will respond to pressure by producing a thicker line and the brush will make a scratchy or lined look when it starts to run out of ink these pens are also messy to use for beginners and may be more challenging than using felt pen or a fountain pen try one to two different pens at a time choosing the right calligraphy pen may be a process of trial and error pick two different pens for example a felt pen and a fountain pen to get a sense of how each pen writes 2 x research source you may also want to narrow down your choices by thinking about how messy you want the writing process to be and how simplified you would like your calligraphy set up to be a brush pen for example will require preparing the ink and constant dipping in the ink as you write but it may write smoother lines than a felt tip pen which requires no preparation but may not write as smoothly if you are deciding between a fountain pen and a dip pen keep in mind dip pens give you more freedom to choose nibs inks and different holders or handles however they can be messier and more temperamental than a fountain pen a fountain pen or another cartridge filled pen will be less messy and more convenient as you do not need to prepare ink before you write but you are limited to only certain kinds of inks and nibs when you use a fountain pen and fountain pens will be less flexible to write with than a dip pen or a brush pen 3 x research source buy the ink for a dip pen or a brush pen if you are using a dip pen or a brush pen you will need to purchase the ink for the pen use calligraphy ink rather than fountain pen ink calligraphy ink is more viscous and will cling to the nib better which will give you more control over the ink as you write 4 x research source look for thicker inks like india ink or chinese stick ink avoid india inks that contain shellac as this substance dries quickly and can damage the nib in your dip pen or brush pen many brush pens and dip pens will come in sets that contain the ink and the nib get ink cartridges for a fountain pen many fountain pens will come with ink cartridges and nibs recommended by the manufacturer start with the manufacturer s recommendations when you first start writing calligraphy 5 x research source some pens may also have converters so you can use different inks in the pen once you get comfortable with basic fountain pen ink fountain pen ink is thin so it will not clog the pen as you write but the nib unit in more fountain pens is rigid so it will not be as flexible as a dip pen or a brush pen other fountain pens may be piston pens these come with an internal converter so you can dip the pen in the ink and basically have the pen suck the ink into the cartridge with piston pens you do not need to invest in ink cartridges or a converter choose a nib for your pen fountain pens dip pens and brush pens use nibs to hold the ink in the pen and provide a supply of ink as you write contrary to popular belief it is not a good idea to literally dip your calligraphy pen into a pot of ink this will lead to blots and uncontrolled ink flow instead invest in a nib there are two types of nibs 6 x research source italic nibs these nibs are usually used to write styles like gothic and italic in calligraphy italic nibs have a blunt edge and are rigid so they are not very flexible and don t allow you to vary your lines or strokes when you write flex nibs most calligraphers use flex nibs these nibs are rounded with two tines that end at a point the more the tines split on the nib the wider the line width available on the pen you must apply pressure as you write to separate the tines and create wider or thinner lines load the fountain pen with the ink cartridge your fountain pen will consist of three components the cap the nib and the barrel you will need to load the ink cartridge into the nib to get ink flowing in your fountain pen to do this 7 x research source remove the cap and then remove the barrel from the nib by turning it clockwise insert the cartridge into the nib by pushing it firmly on the non pointed side of the nib once the cartridge is attached to the nib you will hear a small click you can switch between bottled ink and ink cartridges with a fountain pen as you get more advanced in your calligraphy writing use an eyedropper to put ink in the reservoir of the dip pen or the brush pen due to the nature of dip pens and brush pens you will need to reload the reservoir on the pen with ink after several letters or words to put ink in the reservoir 8 x research source hold the pen horizontally in your writing hand use your other hand to dip the eye dropper into the pen ink so there is several drops in the dropper apply ink from the dropper into the reservoir on the pen continue to hold the pen horizontally so you do not get any ink spots on your paper or your hands put the dropper on a saucer next to the ink you will need to reload the pen again after a few minutes of writing test the ink flow of the pen on a piece of scrap paper before you practice calligraphy on your main piece of paper write on fountain pen paper not regular office paper low quality paper that is thin like office paper will cause your ink to bleed all over the paper and will likely ruin your calligraphy look for paper that is fountain pen friendly at your local craft store 9 x research source most fountain pen friendly paper will be thicker and of higher quality to prevent ink bleeding or feathering when you are first learning how to write calligraphy you may want to use practice sheets with lines and margins you can access a practice sheet here and print it out on thick paper this will help you get used to writing within certain guidelines so that as you continue practice you can write on calligraphy paper with no lines use a sloped writing surface for dip pens or brush pens these pens work well if they are writing on a sloped surface like an angled writing desk an easel or a board on your lap that is sloped against the edge of a table 10 x research source always use a stable writing surface that cannot slide or shift you should also adjust your seat so you are at a comfortable working height over the writing surface keep the calligraphy ink within reach of your non writing hand as well as the eye dropper so you can re fill the nib of the pen easily you should also have a small saucer for resting the brush in case you need to leave your work area this will ensure there are no splotches on your paper or your hands fasten the paper to your writing surface use masking tape or paper clips to keep the paper flat against the writing surface a shifting paper can lead to blotches and broken lines when you are practicing your calligraphy 11 x research source if you are using a practice sheet of paper with lines you may want to place another thicker piece of paper under it so the ink does not soak through your writing surface you may also want to place a guard sheet under your writing hand so the oils from your hand do not absorb into the paper or get onto your calligraphy do a basic downward stroke hold the pen so it is horizontal to the top writing line this is a zero degree nib angle keep the nib flat to the paper as you make a vertical downward stroke on the paper maintain equal pressure as you make the downward stroke you should have a downward stroke that shows the thickest downstroke possible with your pen 12 x research source to get the thinnest stroke pull the pen horizontally across the paper from left to right make thick downward strokes and thin horizontal strokes to form the boxes this will help you get a sense of how much pressure is needed to make thick strokes and thin strokes with your pen use your arm rather than your wrist to write with the pen this will help your arm stay steady and give your writing flow make upward strokes adjust your pen so you are holding it at a forty five degree angle use the boxes you drew as a marker forty five degrees is halfway between o and 90 so cut one side of the box in half and place your nib parallel to that diagonal line practice making upward strokes with your pen at a forty five degree angle starting at the bottom line on the paper 13 x research source apply various amounts of pressure for each stroke the more pressure you apply on the pen the thicker your strokes will be thinner strokes are created with less pressure on the pen as you make the upward stokes do a sawtooth pattern use the lines on the paper to create a jagged pattern that will help you practice angling the pen keep your pen at a forty five degree angle 14 x research source make diagonal upstrokes that are thin and vertical downstrokes that are thick you should form a sawtooth like pattern lift your pen every third stroke and do one downward stroke and then one upward stroke continue to make sawtooth patterns for an entire practice sheet use practice sheets for different writing styles practice creating boxes and strokes with your pen until you feel comfortable with these basic lines you can then move into writing script such as letters and words in calligraphy 15 x research source there are several different writing styles from gothic to italic to cursive writing each type has rules and guidelines for writing letters and words with a calligraphy pen print off practice sheets of each of these writing styles and practice each letter until you get comfortable enough to create short words and phrases,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to use a brush pen,learning to use a brush pen can seem like a daunting task but it mostly requires dedication and practice if you want to perfect the skill learning how to hold your brush pen and mastering the basics of writing with it will help you create sleek strokes in no time you can take your brush pen work to the next level by adding more advanced techniques like blending colors and using different fonts,hold your brush pen close to the nib the nib of a brush pen is the marker part of the pen holding your brush pen right above the nib will give you the most control over your brush pen strokes experiment with holding your pen closer and farther from the nib to see what feels most comfortable and produces the best results 1 x research source use your entire arm to keep your script steady and even practice keeping your wrist straight and fingers stationary allowing the motion of your arm to guide your brush pen when you need to change your application of pressure let that force come from the strength of your arm rather than from a change of position or pressure in your fingers or wrist 2 x research source trace individual letters of a printed font tracing the letters of brush or handwritten fonts printed from your computer will help you get comfortable with using your brush pen to create scripts you will quickly learn that you must adjust the pressure on your brush pen and its angle to the paper to successfully trace the letters of a font 3 x research source practicing by tracing a font can also help you develop a consistent style of writing across individual letters words and sentences 4 x research source use upstrokes to create thin lines prepare to make the upstroke by holding your pen at about a 90 degree angle to the paper applying light pressure draw your brush pen upwards on the paper 5 x research source use downstrokes to create thick lines prepare to make the downstroke by holding your pen at about a 45 degree angle to the paper applying heavy pressure draw your brush pen downwards on the paper 6 x research source use paper with guidelines to practice writing as you start writing words and sentences writing within a designated area will keep your script level across the word or page you can use lined paper graph paper or you can draw your own straight lines across blank pages to make your own guideline paper 7 x research source think about how much space you need to create crisp strokes and smooth line transitions when buying or making your guideline paper 8 x research source if you want to produce hand lettering without guidelines but aren t quite ready to do so lightly pencil in your guidelines and then erase them after you re done writing use fonts as a reference for consistent style as you practice writing with your brush pen keep a printed font reference nearby try to mimic the font you choose to guide the style of your letters and words master the art of connecting letters instead of picking your pen up in between letters give the letters in your words a tail that trails out from the letter itself kind of like connecting cursive letters your tail should be a thin brush stroke that you can easily draw up to connect to the next letter in the word you re writing 9 x research source if you re having difficulty connecting letters in succession try giving your letters tails and then going back later to gently make the final connecting stroke between the tail and the following letter 10 x research source experiment with creating different fonts mastery of brush pen lettering can be evidenced by how many different styles you can letter in once you can produce consistent brush pen lettering in one font find other fonts you like and work on adding these new styles to your repertoire 11 x research source you can revert to tracing printed fonts as a means of easing yourself into writing with your brush pen in new styles learn to create a watercolor effect you ll need a plastic surface a watercolor painting pallet works great and a water brush in addition to your brush pens use your brush pen to deposit ink onto the pallet then wet your water brush and use it to pick up some color from the pallet finally paint onto your paper with the color on your water brush 12 x research source by adding water the colors from your brush pens will blend together in the same way that watercolors blend 13 x research source,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to write in gothic calligraphy,gothic calligraphy is a style of beautiful hand lettering that s been around since the middle ages 1 x research source the actual term for this type of calligraphy is blackletter and while there are a number of variations this form of writing is beautiful and ornate whether you re addressing wedding envelopes or you re just looking for a new hobby learning blackletter is a fun and challenging pursuit that anyone can enjoy,work on a sloped surface if you have one sitting hunched over a regular writing desk can restrict your arm movement and can create tension in your neck and shoulders since you have to move your whole wrist and arm to create calligraphy a desk that s sloped down toward you can give you more freedom of movement resulting in neater lettering 2 x research source if you don t have a sloped desk try propping a piece of wood on a thick book on top of your desk try to create about a 45 angle if all you have is a flat surface that s okay too just keep in mind it might be easier if you can find something to prop up to create a slope especially if you plan to do a lot of calligraphy choose a dip pen and ink bottle for the most traditional setup while you can practice calligraphy with any writing implement original hand lettering was done with a pen fitted with a nib you then dip the nib in a bottle of ink such as india ink a small chamber inside the nib called the vent fills up with ink and the ink flows out of the nib while you re writing 3 x research source india ink is a thick black ink that is most commonly used for hand lettering look for a dip pen with a nib holder that s about 15 20 cm 5 9 7 9 in which is about the length of a regular ink pen you can find dip pens and ink at a craft supply store or online you may also be able to find them where office supplies are sold opt for a 2mm 3mm round nib with medium flexibility when you re choosing a nib you don t want it to be too flexible as it will be difficult to create smooth straight lines also if you choose a nib that s too small it will be hard to see the serifs or the horizontal flourishes at the top and bottom of the letters a 2mm 3mm nib with a rounded tip and medium flexibility will be the easiest to control 4 x research source look for a package that says rounded on it to find the right nib only the very tip will be rounded off so the nib will still look pointed at first glance use heavy printer paper or cardstock to practice on most regular copy paper or notebook paper is too thin for the liquid ink to help prevent the ink from bleeding through your paper try using at least 120 gsm 32 lb printer paper to practice on if all you have is thin paper stack 3 4 sheets together so the ink doesn t bleed through to create a finished project consider using heavy cardstock you can also find notebooks specifically for calligraphy practice these are typically already lined look for these wherever stationary or crafting supplies are sold print out sample alphabet sheets and prop them close by your work stations there are several different styles of blackletter calligraphy including textualis rotunda schwabacher and fraktur search online for the different styles and choose the one you like the most then print out the alphabet so you can use it as a reference while you re practicing textualis may be the easiest to start learning since there aren t as many curved lines textualis is ornate and square and is perhaps the most common form of blackletter the letters in rotunda as the name suggests are more round schwabacher and fraktur are both rounded as well though not as much as rotunda and the two styles look very similar to each other however there are certain distinctions for specific letters 5 x research source for instance in fraktur the capital s looks similar to a modern capital g but in schwabacher it looks more like the s that s used today however the capital letter a is nearly identical in both styles resembling a modern lowercase u keep tissues paper towels or a cloth nearby to wipe up ink working with a dip pen can be messy you may get ink on your fingers or your desk or you may need to wipe up extra ink from the end of the nib to make cleanup easier it s best to have some sort of cloth or tissue at your work station before you ever get started 6 x research source you may also want a small bowl of water nearby to make cleanup easier but it isn t necessary line your paper if it isn t already lined draw a short horizontal nib mark near the top of your paper then move the tip of the pen down to the bottom right corner of that mark and draw another line repeat this for a total of 8 marks to create what looks like a pixelated diagonal line then use a ruler and a pencil to draw 4 horizontal lines across the paper start the first line above the first nib mark make the second between nib marks 2 and 3 put the third line between marks 6 and 7 and the last line below the 8th nib mark 7 x research source when you re finished you ll have a middle row that s 4 nib widths high with a top and a bottom row that are 2 nib widths each the middle row is called your x height and it s where most of your lines will be drawn letters like c m and o will be entirely included in the x height the top row is for your ascenders like on the letters b d and h while the bottom row is for descenders such as on g p and y dip the pen nib in the ink then shake it firmly when you re ready to start writing dip the nib in the bottom of ink to fill the vent then with the pen still held just inside the bottle give the pen a quick downward shake this should help remove any excess ink built up on the pen tip 8 x research source hold your pen at about a 40 angle to the paper you don t need a protractor to get exactly the precise angle but you should practice holding the pen the right way use a normal pen grip then hold the pen so it s perpendicular to the paper or straight out with the nib pointed at the sheet then bring the pen down until it s angled almost halfway between parallel and perpendicular 9 x research source this will give you more control over the pen making it easier to create the strokes start by drawing a simple downward stroke touch the tip of the nib to the top of your x height or the middle row on your lined paper then using even pressure draw the tip of the nib straight down to create a vertical line 10 x research source repeat this several times trying to leave an equal amount of space between each line add a serif stroke to the bottom of a line once you feel comfortable with your vertical strokes it s time to add a flourish draw a vertical line just as you did before then stop about 1 nib width above the baseline and pull the pen to the right 11 x research source the serif should be a horizontal line about 1 nib width across if you lift the pen before drawing the serif make sure it s completely connected to the previous stroke without any spaces practice this several times as well create a serif stroke at the top of a line many letters also have a serif at the top to create this start at the waist line or the second line on your ruled sheet and draw a horizontal stroke that s about 1 nib width to the right then without picking the pen up from the paper draw a line straight down to the baseline 12 x research source you can also practice starting your serif at the top line rather than the waist line practice a line with a serif at the top and the bottom now that you ve practiced creating serifs on the top and the bottom of the letters it s time to put it all together draw a serif at the top of your waist line then draw a straight line down stopping about 1 nib width from the baseline finish by drawing another serif at the bottom of the line 13 x research source keep practicing until the top and bottom serifs are the same size each time you draw this shape this is a basic lower case i or a lowercase l if you start from the top line try tracing the letters before you draw them on your own it can sometimes help to trace a letter to get a feel for its construction once you ve mastered drawing a line with a serif lay a sheet of printer paper over the sample alphabet you printed then trace over the letter with your calligraphy pen trying to match the serifs and flourishes as closely as possible it can be helpful to practice one letter several times before moving on to the next one start practicing letters that fit in your x height once you feel comfortable tracing the letters start writing them freehand try practicing letters that are entirely contained in the x height to start letters made up of all straight lines like i m n and w are the easiest to learn first 14 x research source you ve already practiced drawing i and l so try drawing m next this is an easy letter because it s made of 3 straight lines then 2 serifs as connectors the letters a c e i m n o r s u v w x and z will all be contained within the x height draw ascenders above the x height the row above the x height is for your ascenders or the long lines reaching up above letters like b and h the top serif on the letter t also goes into your ascender row although it s not quite as tall as the other ascenders 15 x research source other letters with an ascender are d f k and l mark your descenders in the space below the x height for letters that drop down like g or j draw your lines below the baseline reaching all the way down to the bottom row in some cases you might add decorative flourishes that reach down in the descender s row also other letters with descenders are p q and y make a hairline stroke with the pen to dot the letters i and j when you re dotting an i or j a dot will look too small while a full nib mark will be too wide instead use the tip of your pen to create a very thin angled stroke on top of those letters 16 x research source typically the mark will be angled upward from left to right however you can play around with this if you d like to take more of a creative approach to your calligraphy sit up straight and relax your arm muscles practicing good posture with your back straight and your shoulders back will give you better control over the pen and it will help keep your letters neat and even also try to keep your arm relaxed if you grip the pen too tightly your letters will be messy and it will hard to get the artistic flair that s characteristic of this lettering style 17 x research source try keeping both feet on the floor while you re writing if you notice yourself getting stiff or tired stand up and stretch for a few minutes move your whole hand and wrist when you re writing calligraphy is about broad strokes so you don t want to just move the pen with your fingers make sure your whole hand is engaged including your wrist as you create the strokes 18 x research source although it might not seem like it this will actually give you more control over your letters and it will get easier with practice lift your pen between strokes in calligraphy letters are typically made with a number of strokes to ensure your serifs are visible and each line is precise lift your pen after you make each stroke 19 x research source it s okay to make a line and a serif without lifting your pen if you d like practice lower case letters first then upper case upper case gothic calligraphy tends to be more ornate than lower case letters with extra serifs and flourishes that can be difficult for a beginner take your time studying lower case letters first once you re comfortable with those move on to capital letters 20 x research source compare the negative space in your letters to the samples to find errors the empty space in a letter like the opening inside of an o or the space between the lines in an m can be helpful when you re trying to correct a shape that isn t quite right look at the spaces and compare them to your sample letters to see if you can spot where you re making an error 21 x research source for instance by looking at the negative space you might notice that there s an uneven amount of space on either side of the middle line in an m or that one serif is too low when you re drawing the o,Arts-and-Entertainment

how to clean calligraphy dip pen nibs,one of the most important parts of writing calligraphy is cleaning your pen and continuing to keep the nib clean dip pens are cleaned similarly to fountain pens but the designs are much less complicated however dip pen nibs are changed often and new nibs require an initial cleaning to remove the protective manufacturer s oils,soak a soft sponge with clean water and apply a button sized amount of de greasing dish soap most dish detergent soaps are made to scrub off grease and are excellent at removing the oils from pen nibs this can also be done with a soft toothbrush instead of a sponge gently scrub the nib from all angles for about 30 seconds if the nib has a removable reservoir remove it and clean it as well if the nib has a non removable reservoir be sure to get soap under it and scrub it as best you can without bending the reservoir away damaging the nib rinse the nib in water for a few more seconds until your confident all the soap is off dry the nib with a soft cloth and you re ready to write when you dry it drawing the nib across the cloth as if you were writing helps to draw out any water left in the reservoir moisten a soft toothbrush with clean water and apply a very small amount of toothpaste toothpaste oddly enough can do an even better job at removing the oils than dish soap gently scrub the nib from all angles for about 30 seconds if the nib has a removable reservoir remove it and clean it as well if the nib has a non removable reservoir be sure to get under it and scrub it as best you can without bending the reservoir away damaging the nib rinse the nib in clean water for a few more seconds to remove the toothpaste dry the nib with a soft cloth and you re ready to write when you dry it drawing the nib across the cloth as if you were writing helps to draw out any water left in the reservoir rinse as much ink off as you can using dish soap and a soft sponge or toothbrush gently scrub off any more ink rinse the nib again to for a few seconds then remove the soap or toothpaste if the ink is dried on and your having trouble cleaning it off drop the nib in a bottle of pen cleaner and let it soak for 30 minutes to several hours depending on how bad the dried ink is after letting it soak remove the nib from the cleaner and rinse it with clean water for several seconds to remove the ink and cleaner you may need to use soap again dry the nib with a soft cloth a store it in a safe place when you dry it drawing the nib across the cloth as if you were writing helps to draw out any water left in the reservoir,Arts-and-Entertainment
how to do nib painting,nib painting involves using the nibs found on the ends of calligraphy style or old fashioned ink pens painting with nibs can be done using oils or watercolors there are different nibs namely round long and short tips and each provides a different painting texture when used it s a good idea to experiment with the nibs when you re a beginner to familiarize yourself with the end results this article will provide you with a short and easy nib oil painting tutorial to get you started in this intriguing and fun craft,assemble the items needed to undertake the project for this project you ll need both straight and round nibs the remaining items needed are listed at the end of the article lay down a felt cloth on a piece of strong cardboard glue it in place this becomes the work board that you can use again and again for the paintings try out the nibs do some small and simple painting to get a feel for how the nibs work with the oil paints cut the velvet cloth with desired size mark two centimeters along the perimeter of the cloth to enable the painting to be framed this area will not be painted so check the size against the frame you d like to use before you begin painting lay over the felt piece in readiness for drawing and painting on make a rough sketch on the cloth of your desired image you can either mark this directly onto the fabric or use tracing paper and transfer the image to the fabric take about 0 5 cm of paint from the oil paint tube place it on your index finger for smoothing the paint use the nib and rub the paint in the same manner as you d mix sugar into milk dab a small part of this paint on the nib start applying the paint from nib onto the cloth in its respective place while painting you will note that it appears like a line you have to paint like this all over continuously adding more lines to form the image parts you can mix two colors while painting to get beautiful shading in the scenery or image use the round nib for details for example if small flowers are to be painted use a round nib just keep the nib in the paint and make sure not much paint is settled on the top of the nib press the nib where the petals of a small flower or a cloud are to be made take your time there is no need to finish the painting at one sitting you can take several days to complete it as desired allow to dry once the painting is done leave it aside for two to three days to dry up it won t be ready for framing until it is completely dry,Arts-and-Entertainment

is characterized by bold disjointed strokes though striking artistic touches can be difficult with the pens used in this style 1 x research source the pens used in broad edged calligraphy can only be pulled when writing which limits your range of artistic motion somewhat 2 x research source with enough practice many of the techniques used in pointed pen calligraphy can be imitated even with a broad edged pen focus on pointed pen calligraphy for creative results pointed pen is the second and more common style in western calligraphy this style is smoother more responsive and allows more creative freedom though generally considered more difficult this style will yield the flowing calligraphy most familiar to people learning more than one style at a time will make it easier to confuse the unique characteristics of each so you might want to master them one at a time buy a calligraphy starter kit along with your pen you re also going to need ink paper and nibs writing tips if you re using a straight or oblique holder these supplies are often bundled together in calligraphy starter kits sold online and in hobby stores fountain pens are versatile and good for on the go calligraphy but straight and oblique holders for nibs which are then dipped in ink are the traditional standard holders generally require nibs and even fountain pen nibs will wear out with time some nibs might work better for you than others but nikko g nibs are a favorite among calligraphers 3 x research source purchase smooth non fibrous paper like rhodia lined paper most kinds of cartridge paper work as well and are relatively inexpensive 4 x research source each ink will have unique features walnut ink is one of the easiest to use but iron gall ink and walker s copperplate are two popular brands to keep in mind familiarize yourself with different calligraphy alphabets alongside the two styles of calligraphy there are uncountable alphabets in calligraphy alphabets also called scripts are the equivalent of font each script has its own unique features six common alphabets you might look into include roman rustic capitals imitate the grand capitals on ancient roman structures uncial is easy to read and conveys a serenity quality try it with poems and quotes gothic textura quadrata is bold and striking it works well with titles and headings roundhand is a simple style that is easy to pen

letter with your designs to create a full and dynamic illustration 6 x research source for example you could decorate the letter s with a snake and create the illusion that the snake is coiled around

colors go over your pencil sketch with color when you re happy with your designs use ink pens markers colored pencils or paint to fill your letter with any colors you like color in the elements of

start learning the strokes necessary to write with brush lettering and should you want to improve your writing skill further there are helpful techniques you can use such as using graph paper and tracing the work of others,choose a suitable pen a brush lettering calligraphy pen looks a lot like a regular marker however these special pens work similarly to a watercolor brush the nib of the pen its writing tip is flexible this will allow you to use just the point for fine lines or more of the nib for thicker lines 1 x research source in many cases you can find brush pens at your local craft store like michael s or hobby lobby check online for coupons these pens can sometimes be expensive if you re having difficulty finding a brush pen search for one online a popular brush pen used by calligraphers is the fude brush pen fude foo day means writing brush in japanese 2 x research source purchase calligraphy paper if desired although plain paper should work well enough for practice in some cases low quality paper can cause the ink to feather or bleed calligraphy paper can be bought from many craft stores specialty stationary stores or online calligraphy paper can be expensive an inexpensive alternative is 32 lb laserjet paper this works great for practice and can be found at office supply stores 3 x research source hold your pen correctly for the most part a brush pen should be held much like a regular pen generally you should hold the pen to the paper so that it forms a 45 angle you may find you have better control over the pen by holding it close to the nib 4 x research source keep your grip relatively relaxed when holding your brush pen maintain only a slight bend in the middle finger of your writing hand while writing depending on your hand you may find that a grip unique to yourself works best mainly try to support the pen with your thumb index and middle fingers instead of trying to control the pen with them 5 x research source prepare your writing surface because a brush pen is more like a paintbrush it can apply a lot of ink to paper very quickly while getting used to writing with a brush pen you may want to lay a cover below your practice paper like newspaper or scrap paper this will prevent ink from bleeding through and getting on your writing surface 6 x research source if you have extra sheets of paper you can use a few of these to prevent bleed through from getting on your writing surface you could also write on a clipboard or a piece of cardboard print out and use practice sheets if desired although practice sheets aren t necessary they can be a big help many practice sheets break down letters into numbered strokes so you ll have an easier time knowing which stroke to make first and whether it s an upstroke or a downstroke there are many free calligraphy resources online do an online keyword search for brush calligraphy practice or brush lettering practice and print practice sheets if you don t have a printer you can always pull up practice sheets on a computer and imitate them on a separate sheet of paper 7 x research source moderate your pen pressure according to stroke direction a downstroke is whenever your pen moves in a downward motion increase your pressure on downstrokes to make these thicker upstrokes are when your pen moves in an upward motion decrease your pressure for these to make them thinner if you have difficult making downstrokes thick you may want to slightly decrease the angle between your pen and paper this will allow more of the nib to touch the paper making a thicker line when making upstrokes you may find that increasing the angle between your pen and paper so that the pen is directed more closely to straight up helps to thin your lines 8 x research source learn the 8 basic strokes of brush lettering there are 8 strokes that make up nearly every letter in the brush lettering alphabet stroke 1 is a thick downward line that slopes down from right to left stroke 2 move upwards from left to right to form a slightly inward bowing line these are the simplest of the 8 basic strokes stroke 3 forms a u shape it starts with a downstroke on the left and thins to an upstroke at the bottom of the u stroke 4 forms an upside down u it starts with an upstroke on the left and changes to a downstroke at the top of the upside down u stroke 5 forms an o the left half of the circle should be thick and the right thin stroke 6 forms an n shape starting on the left an upstroke transitions to a downstroke and then finishes with an upstroke stroke 7 forms a top loop an upstroke curls back on itself to form a loop and transition into a downstroke the up and downstroke should cross at about the downstroke s middle stroke 8 forms a bottom loop a downstroke curls backwards in a loop to an upstroke the upstroke should cross the downstroke at about the halfway point of the downstroke 9 x research source familiarize yourself with the stroke order of letters now that you ve mastered the 8 basic strokes it should be much easier to learn letters practice each letter on its own multiple times until you ve mastered each letter both upper and lowercase 10 x research source when practicing the stroke order of letters be sure to follow the order indicated on your practice sheet or web resource carefully incorrect stroke order will affect the appearance of your brush lettering practice slowly when mastering strokes learning brush lettering is almost like teaching yourself again how to write this can be frustrating and lead to you trying to speed through your practice but be sure to take your time learning stroke order incorrectly could lengthen the time it takes for you to learn brush lettering if you learn something incorrectly you may have to re learn it the right way down the road master connecting letters together once you ve mastered the stroke order of letters you can start working on putting letters together it may take some time before you get the hang of connecting letters together in this writing style start by practicing simple combinations like those found in your name the names of friends and so on 11 x research source the final stroke of a letter you are writing will determine whether you ll need an up or downstroke to connect the letters if the ending stroke of the letter just written is higher than the first stroke of the next letter use a downstroke and vice versa you can also connect letters by extending the ending tail of the letter you are writing so that the first stroke of the next letter intersects it this will give the appearance that the letters are connected 12 x research source use graph paper to improve the balance of your writing graph paper will make it easier to see when the balance of your lettering is off or lopsided some practice sheets may have graph lines drawn in to help you see the distribution of properly drawn letters 13 x research source write out full words in brush lettering little by little increase the length of your writing practice write out common words in brush lettering then try your hand at composing full messages or writing full length letters using this writing style the more you practice writing with brush lettering the more engrained it ll become with enough practice it should become second nature 14 x research source trace the work of others or pre printed messages if you notice you have trouble putting all the basics together to write full messages this can be a powerful practice tool print out a message written in brush lettering trace this printed message to improve your sense of the flow of this writing style if you have a friend who s good at brush lettering ask them to write you a short message trace this to practice and improve your own technique use brush lettering regularly the more you use brush lettering the more familiar and easier it will become however if you stop using this writing style for a length of time you may notice that you get

around you and reflecting it in your art work notice how the light changes during the day how colors affect you how an interaction makes you feel as the saying goes it is actually really important to

style the best way to define yourself as a unique artist is to create your own style within the medium that you have learned no one can teach you your own style you need to discover it for yourself try experimenting with different techniques break yourself out of your comfort zone 7 x research source for example if you like to paint still life paintings try painting a still life by adding your own touch to it rather that simply replicating what is in front of you change the colors make the subjects look cartoon y or distorted in some way play around with it enroll in local art classes

many months you will be taught by other artists who can show you how to master the basics of your medium while also helping you to follow your own artistic path to find art classes in your town you can look at local newspaper event listings talk to friends you might have in the artist community or simply run a search for art classes in name of your town on your favorite internet search engine study the masters visit museums and peruse books on all sorts of art and design learn from the masters by looking carefully at their works a great way to hone your skill is to try to imitate the art of someone considered to be a master the world over try motifs and techniques that catch your interest a great way to improve in your artistic medium is to select a work by a master and try to replicate it as best you can for instance if you want to improve your painting skills pick a painting by vincent van gogh such as starry night and try to paint it when you have painted it as close to the original as possible paint it again this time allowing yourself to go a little outside the original add details that you think you would have added had you been standing next to van gogh looking up at that starry sky perhaps the colors would be different the tree more or less defined etc go to art school if you want to take your art career to the next level you could consider going to art school some things to consider when picking an art school include reputation costs strength of the courses and professors location and facilities do they have a dark room a kiln etc consider if you think this school will bolster your strengths and improve your weaknesses you will have to apply for any art school you want to attend find out how to do that here you should also consider going to an art school vs attending university some universities have excellent art programs the main difference is that art schools will tailor their general education classes around art for instance a history ge course that might normally be history of the united states would instead be artists in the american revolution make friends in the artist community making friends that have the same passion for art that you have is a great way to really immerse yourself in the world of art having artist friends can be beneficial because they can offer you criticism on your work and actually know what they re talking about teach you new techniques and inspire you with their own work to find like minded artists see if your town school or church has any artist clubs that you could join you could look in newspaper event listings or search for local groups on the internet you could even consider joining a virtual art group there are many online forums that you can become a part of and chat with people who love art as much as you do visit art studios another great way to see what other artists are creating in your medium is to go to art gallery openings in your area art galleries are great places to meet people and see other artists work you may find that you are inspired to try a new technique 8 x research source create an art portfolio a portfolio is a collection of your best work that you show

in the art world as an artist just joining the art world you will want to make as many connections as possible your network can consist of your family friends classmates professors bosses mentors etc ask these people in your network if they know of any artistic opportunities that you may be able to get involved with ie gallery openings free classes places that like to show local art work etc look for art networking events in your area run an internet search of art events and networking opportunities in your area go out of your way to meet people who you think may be able to help you become a better artist or boost your career if a professor says her world famous painter friend is coming to town and you are an aspiring painter ask your professor if you could perhaps briefly meet with her friend don t be let down if she says no there are truly thousands of opportunities for you to build your network find a venue where you can show your work showing your work is one of the best ways to get recognition for the pieces you have created find out if any local coffee shops bars restaurants etc ever hang the work of local artists on their walls if they do bring in a portfolio and show them some of your work find out if they would like to hang up your pieces for a set amount of time you could also talk to local galleries and see if you could get some of your pieces into their next show galleries often like to promote local art get internships with a master artist in this case internships are more like apprenticeships being a studio helper for a great artist in your medium can be one of the best ways to learn more about your medium while also lodging you in the inner circle of the artist community if you have gone to art school find out if any of your professors need a studio assistant or any help with projects that he or she is working on professors can be a great link to the more prominent art world and working with them in their studio will help you to practice what they have taught you in their classes,Arts-and-Entertainment

maintain for the duration instead of having to start over get dressed when you are finished with your session put on your robe and return to your private changing area and put on your clothes make sure you don t leave anything in the studio you should wear comfortable clothes it is a good idea to have a bag for your dirty robe or towel so you can wash these after your session be prepared when you say goodbye to the artist you will want to discuss any further sessions at this time have your date book and pen handy when you come out of the change room in case the artist would like to work with you again it s also a good idea to prepare a business card to hand to the artist ask for feedback from the artist once you ve worked with the artist a few times you can even ask for a letter of recommendation that you can use to help you find future work follow up with your artist you want to show initiative and enthusiasm if you want to be hired again call or email to confirm a time and

successive degree of b pencil is softer blacker and smudgier 2b is a good sketch pencil 4b is a great one that gives good shading and 6b or higher is almost like using charcoal for ease of smudging and shading 2 x research source purchase some how to drawing books this includes books on specific subjects like how to draw animals how to draw horses how to draw seascapes etc whatever you like most or get interested in try to accomplish at least one drawing a day you can even frame them and put them up on your walls to inspire you to keep going through the next day you can also check out drawing books from your local library and find out which one inspires you the most before buying it work through each of the exercises in turn rather than trying to do everything in the book at once date your daily sketches they don t need to be complex or difficult a five minute gesture sketch is as useful for learning to draw as a half hour spent doing a detailed drawing if you have a half hour spending it on half a dozen shorter sketches will actually give better practice try to get it right but don t worry about perfection you ll achieve good recognizable drawings by constant practice more than anything else 3 x research source choose a favorite subject this might be your favorite animal a favorite flower a rock a bottle with light coming through it anything you would really like to draw well and care about personally draw the same thing over and over many times in many different ways repeated drawing of the same subject or type of subject each of your cats your cat from several different photos your cat s paw one day your cat s nose the next will give you a much richer grasp of the anatomy and proportions of that subject when you ve drawn your pet cat enough times it becomes easy to sketch a tiger on the first try draw enough pebbles and a mountain becomes easy and understandable sketch and draw anything you see it could be the homeless dude begging for change or the little girl skipping around with a balloon in her hand whatever you see that looks interesting draw or sketch it 4 x research source still life is one of the easiest subjects for beginners to draw literally the objects don t move choose simple ones at first a vase without too many curlicues a few pebbles a flower without too many petals a clear bottle with an interesting shape etc draw each of the objects separately as a study then start arranging them together in different ways to see how they go together the big advantage to still life is that your models don t move and if you do it indoors the light from your lamps doesn t change with the time of day either animal drawing may be your passion start with your pets start when they re sleeping even if that doesn t seem like an exciting pose it s when the animal s more likely to hold still long enough to be drawn use photos of your pets visit zoos with a camera and snap photos of every animal you see and like then work from your own photos look for open source photos like wikipedia commons and other photos where the photographer gives permission to draw from them you can also contact photographers who take good animal photos and post them on flickr or facebook asking permission to draw from their photos many will be happy to give permission and most will want to see your drawings when you re used to drawing animals fast from life try drawing at the zoo or wildlife like the birds at your feeder life drawing of animals is a good way to learn to do quick gestures and detail them later buildings and architecture study perspective as it s important in buildings more than anything else to make them look real find a good book on perspective and do all the exercises be careful about working from photos because they will sometimes distort vertical lines and alter perspective you may have to correct the photo once you understand what you re doing this is another popular fine art subject that never loses its appeal like still life you can go out and draw buildings in person without your model getting up to walk away 5 x research source landscapes are a traditional fine art subject sketch your own yard from life often sometimes a small beautiful area sometimes trying for the big panoramic view go out on camping trips or visit local parks with your sketchbook in hand do several quick five minute or less gesture sketches to get the main elements of your landscape design down just rough outlines then pick the best small thumbnail and draw that view larger this saves a host of troubles over starting with the details of a leaf and only finishing one branch of that tree in an hour details are actually easier than doing the big shapes of things landscape drawing is about textures shapes and light that changes quickly so learn to draw fast get the shapes of shadows down first thing because the angle of the light will change in half an hour and so will the shape of the shadows people are a popular subject for drawing start with the friends and family members you can convince to sit still for a half hour or more to let you draw them paint the ones you love sketch anyone who interests you
