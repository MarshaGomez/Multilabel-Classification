how to understand and develop insight,insight as a means to develop understanding features strongly in a range of eastern and western philosophies as well as the arts and sciences developing insight for example is a main component to developing buddhism which is often called vipassana essentially insight is the best way to learn more about a subject about life and if we are specialized to end stress and understand the mind and body dynamic as a whole rather than bits of our emotions thoughts and reactions this article provides one guide to developing your own insight as well as how to apply the understanding gained to life s problems,seek to understand what insight is insight in essence is both knowledge and understanding derived from an inward sight or more simply looking inside your own mind and body and observing it it can be a natural process or an intentional process as sometimes you need to see things differently to see them clearly but most important is knowing which lens or style to use to make it clear when seeing and studying something you might gain an understanding on how and why it happens simply by seeing it as it happens and not passing judgement the more you watch and the greater your depth of observation the more information you can pick up knowledge is the understanding that is gained and is the part that you can use 1 x trustworthy source association for psychological science nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences go to source in its simplest example you might learn that fire is hot but only through touching its heat likewise if you don t remember that it s harmful and use that knowledge next time you reach to pick up something hot you will burn yourself the skill is all about developing insight so it becomes more than basic survival skills but a way to improve skills and our quality of life and learn things on a much deeper level of understanding start to consider ways to be able to observe your subject general mindfulness and meditation is a classic format when observing the mind and body but also for any subject you wish such as when gazing at a beautiful garden complex poetry or art or when studying a recipe book instruction manual or textbook its best to be aware that meditation or any means used to gain an inward perspective typically consists of two things 1 the initiation of a laboratory like or study field literally the moment you pay attention to it generally everyone has practiced observation and had insights of various degrees throughout their life but it generally is on a superficial level until the person decides to get to the bottom of the matter or when they have observed so much of the subject it is more apparent 2 when practiced to the degree of deep focus or absorption meditation allows the mind to become far more clear calmed and focused and can look at things without distortions or personal agendas 2 x research source consider this metaphor seeing a sample under a microscope is a lot more detailed and focused than just looking at the sample in the hand developing the mind through meditation as well as other methodologies both sharpen your focus and gives you a clearer boundary on the thing you focus on however it would be inaccurate to conclude that very deep meditation is the only way to the goal itself although it certainly does help you might see the finer detail through a microscope certainly but an example to consider is how expert geologists can tell the quality and type of soil in their hand just through the naked eye or by using specific gravity tests and other chemical analyses these skills are learned through experience and testing their understanding they might have used a microscope in their training and career or they might never have done so in this instance it is like a bird with two wings observation such as meditation is one wing examining and understanding is the other wing if the bird has only one wing it can t fly well it will just go round in circles learn about some of the traps and misconceptions that can block the attainment of insight they typically arise more in an intentional guided or an intensive style of study practice rather than those rare but life changing insights that simply happen if you are familiar with them you can at least recognize them when they happen and if they do pop up arguably you can learn even more if you turn your attention to these very obstacles there is occasionally the idea that the means to the end is actually the end itself the complication here is the process or relationship to the process has become more important than focusing on the subject this can be quite a common experience many go through and some do end up going to universities and colleges all their life or studying the mind in meditation in a routine style but never really making any breakthroughs try not to rush things this is another common challenge as people hope to find a magic switch to get full understanding on their subject be it science psychology arts literature and so on or a cure for their troubles as the metaphor goes when the penny drops in the mind and things make sense this often takes time to happen naturally however repeated observation and testing not only helps the penny drop sooner but also the extent of the insight is broadened and many different facets can of the same experience can become clear in this way a person can learn to think and act more creatively and skilfully some also end up stuck with nowhere to go when the insight or knowledge gained is presumed as the goal itself insight is just one half of the story the other half is doing something with it consider that a surgeon through his or her experience designs a new scalpel or forceps but it s only until these tools are used in surgery that they are going to be useful in the same way care must be taken to continuously apply and test any insights gained as well as how to use them as practical tools which in itself can expand the depth of understanding the application of understanding relationships is most important and it goes awry when people prefer to focus on the intellectual rather than the practical for example a chemist might discover a new medicine through testing samples but if the treatment is never made available or ever taken by the patient it does nothing the medicinal discovery itself does not destroy the disease in the same way you have to apply your understanding to achieve the goal for the discoveries are just a means to an end develop your levels of observation and the subsequent knowledge that arises test it out observe and study your subject be objective and look at everything as if you have never seen it before observe it as if it s a totally unique thing but most importantly observe your relationship or interaction with the experience and the object the ways we can learn the most about a subject as well as how to gain the best outcome is to observe our relationships how do we feel about the experience is the mind open or closed to the experience this helps you observe life more completely rather than being selective or allowing parts of the mind to cloud the issue 3 x research source ask yourself often to identify what you see as you might not always know even if you do identify it but a secondary feeling or idea arises then identify that as well once you can identify them you can explore them just like once you ve identified the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle you can start to put the puzzle together and you can gain practical understanding and skills luckily in essence there are very few cases when the solution to many of our life challenges aren t already within the problem we experience or in essence our relationship with the problem by exploring the foundation of the problem a solution can be found or if a solution is simply impossible then a person can then start to come to terms with accepting the realities of life and finding a silver lining or creative opportunity if they are practical in life aspects many of our frustrations unhappiness depression and sorrows happen because we aren t looking at things completely and applying our understanding or observing the issue to understand it generally it is wise to go back to the beginning and examine the central facts and test those in relation to what you see you might be studying to gain an insight into a maths project but if you are too tired or not interested then it is useful to identify this feeling as this is your relationship with the subject be sincere sincerity is actually deep in the practice and benefits of understanding if you are seeing something that is real and can be retested to give the same result then you will have to satisfy yourself that it is what it is it might mean consequently you have to let go of other ideas or wishes but ultimately that is up to you to let them go because you cannot progress beyond these hurdles you have to climb over them until you can leap over them 4 x research source keep observing the subject in order to improve both the depth of understanding and observation for example it took a while until you could repeat the alphabet without error some people can learn it quickly but these are very rare people so it pays to keep observing and learning very often things can suddenly make sense like a light bulb moment even things you have seen dozens of times before through life experience your mind develops the tools needed to put together pieces of the puzzle as well as identify different angles and ways that the experience can be improved the mind is often able to relate what has been seen to prior experiences in order to make connections by using an inward observation eventually even this tool and skill gathering becomes apparent find practical uses for insight the ultimate goal is to become intimately familiar with your mind and body how it reacts to certain things and how they inter relate the key benefit to knowing your mind so well is that you can take one glance at something and know instantly if it s of benefit or harm you may then let go or avoid things that are harmful it takes time but it gets more effective the more you practice it you learn more each time you examine something in a relationship context insight and mindfulness as the two wings of the bird are useful everywhere at work school home and all times in between it has clear uses in empathy being able to understand the challenges and issues we and other people face and then relating and acting appropriately 5 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source in a work or business context insight is also incredibly useful in any area requiring creative thinking as well as conflict resolution many of our problematic relationships between co workers or between boss and employees arise because we don t understand each other and the pressures both sides experience it s these pressures and how we interact with them that limit compromise and flexibility so by applying our insights we can find a middle ground as well as new ideas in a mental well being context there comes a stage in most people s lives that the desires of our chattering mind becomes a common thread in the tapestry of life as well the understanding that it makes us unhappy and dissatisfied with what we have dawns upon us insight is important here in understanding how to let go of shallow desires by correctly identifying your true needs as a stress relief tool eventually what insight helps us to do is to learn what stress actually is how to let it go of it as well as forgive it and to become so practiced in both recognizing and letting go that you just release stress without trying then you are free of so many of your daily troubles in a quality of life tool what insight practices do eventually reveal is that every moment is absolutely unique and new that every experience is fresh even when we are tired depressed and frustrated this insight on its own rejuvenates the observation as its not like watching a tv show over and over although it may seem like it its always different perennially interesting and an opportunity to learn and understand some amazing things f,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to form a philosophy,developing a personal philosophy can be a deeply rewarding life experience a personal philosophy is a framework that helps you understand who you are and make sense of your life forming your own philosophy is quite difficult especially for beginners but the rewards definitely make it worth a try this guide will help get started,understand that you are starting a lifelong journey commit to being open minded and flexible every conscious person has a philosophy individual philosophies can be simple developing or well developed a personal philosophy is a fundamental and integrated understanding about existence and your relationship to all related issues discovering and developing one s philosophy requires self awareness a desire to understand and the will and ability to learn commit to looking for meaning and discern what makes sense your goal is to start on a path of personal growth that will evolve and mature as you pursue the love of wisdom philosophia for that is what philosophy means start reading and learning start with what interests you and try to get a sense of the big ideas that philosophers are concerned with as you learn look for connections between ideas and subjects to find coherence and or arguments this is akin to putting a jigsaw puzzle together some pieces will fit and others won t choose a type of philosophy philosophical thought is organized around many types of philosophies including axiology ontology aesthetics epistemology ethics logic metaphysics and political theory follow your interests feel free to choose more than one type because you see particular linkages you will enjoy thinking through how to meld them successfully 1 x research source after deciding a philosophy type learn the background history of your chosen philosophy including readings from the key philosophers understand the key questions that were addressed and get a solid understanding of the key concepts improve your basic understanding of other types of philosophies you cannot be an expert in everything but recognize that there is great value in understanding the basics of what others have done a broad understanding of what people are struggling with and what the discussions have been about will help you to develop your own personal philosophy feel free to learn and build on existing ideas it is difficult starting from scratch so why not take another philosopher s ideas as a basic framework to get started many well known philosophers started like this for example plato took the undoubtedly oral and sociable socratic method from the real socrates 2 x research source and used it as the basis for his highly polished literary socratic method which in turn was taken by aristotle to form the basis of logic particularly syllogisms 3 x research source expand and evolve your thinking the framework you have selected is a starting point as you experience life test it out and see what works for you and what doesn t when you have time analyze this and refine your framework philosophy over time as you solve problems and assess the quality of the decisions you have made you will be able to evolve from where you started into something autonomous of the original philosophy become a critical thinker keep track of where you have obtained the basis for ideas tenets theories etc in your new philosophy being able to trace your theorizing or conclusions back to their source will help you defending your ideas or pushing them further very little develops in a vacuum 4 x research source referring to what other philosophers have said gives your philosophy greater credibility because you are displaying your depth of knowledge and understanding of existing philosophies be patient and allow your ideas to percolate over time when you have spare time analyze the framework of your nascent philosophy and try to find problems and solutions taking the development of your philosophy gradually will allow it to evolve into something autonomous of the original philosophy keep a journal and continue writing down your thoughts and ideas even if they re not coherent patience is essential because it may take you years to sort through all the discarded notions to find the treasure buried underneath the passage of time is healthy as it allows your ideas to keep evolving and to be tested by daily events ask some pertinent questions such as what is the purpose of your philosophy do you want to apply it to all of society or just a sector what is your role in your philosophy what if any are the roles of particular people in your philosophy how will you explain the basis of your philosophy to others is it helpful on a practical level or utopian how do other belief sets or philosophies fit in with or go against your philosophy are you willing to write down a thesis or book of your philosophy or would you rather write stories that contain your philosophy but are not overtly a philosophical work in structure talk to others interested in philosophy they can point out faults you might have missed and give different solutions this is helpful for developing your philosophy join a local philosophy group club or chapter join an online group that has private forums where you can share your ideas freely and get responses visit your local university and ask to speak with philosophy professors to share your thoughts with them if you find someone else who really understands where your new philosophy is headed embrace their enthusiasm but take care to keep working on your understandings separate from their enthusiasm it is hard to follow someone else while they are still working out what it is that they believe so their enthusiasm may just be because they like and trust you actively find seek out new experiences to help you to see things in different ways and from different angles keep an open mind learn to accept criticism and grow from it it might just help strengthen you and your philosophy always have a pencil and a notebook to note down ideas as they occur to you or you come across them keep reading philosophy it will allow you to see previous philosophers attempts what they found and what fallacies they fell into thus progressing your own philosophy this will also help you to see whether or not you are attempting something that a previous philosopher has already tried keep up to date with the world try reading a newspaper once in a while it ll help you apply theories to real situations for example take a serious news story that involves issues impacting on many sectors of society and ask yourself what would i have done work your answers into your developing philosophy to see if it can withstand actual events and provide explanations instruction or greater understanding see yourself as a philosopher whether or not you work as one a career in philosophy or similar roles such as a researcher in a think tank or institute will ensure you dedicate regular time to your philosophy but for the part time philosopher make sure you dedicate enough time to it so you keep improving and don t forget bits of your work 5 x research source try as much as possible to live up to your thoughts even when you are experiencing something uncanny that may distract you from your opinions get back to those notes that you have made about your philosophy or the inspiring books that you have been reading it ll help,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to explore and study intention,intention is a surprisingly important but rarely explored part of the mind as its significance is only important after the fact only once you ve spent time observing it can you find just how it fits in to day to day living intention is a main stepping stone or foundation of the mind that is important to understand start exploring it today,find out the ways you can best view intention as it happens meditation particularly walking meditation is excellent for this subject but you can find other means such as observation and consideration in day to day activity you can study the mind and mental themes the body and body processes or all of them together if you wish in some cases this is often referred to as mindfulness which is probably the most in depth and practical way to study this subject as it is essentially an awareness of things in the moment as they happen consider and try to identify two main types of intention for lack of better words we could separate them into body functional and emotional psychological types for the purpose of exploring this topic for example you may feel hungry and intend to find a meal which is aimed at meeting a bodily need but the choice as to how to prepare the food is a more emotional or psychological one consider if you are for example hungry and you have a tomato would you have it in a salad in a pasta sauce fried or in a sandwich and so forth once you have decided you would need to prepare it and gather the right tools this means there are new intentions behind your actions in gathering the tools to be able to process the tomato into a meal but the bodily function doesn t really care as a tomato is food be it raw or cooked there are also existing meditation practices devoted to these two types of intention known as body mindfulness and mental mindfulness investigate or try those to see if they help you look at the role intention plays in relation to action intention runs consistently before action and this can be seen such as when you have no intention to do anything at all you can easily just sit and vegetate until you feel the need to do something such as eat go to the toilet bathroom or find something to do if boredom strikes reaction is not really different as it still does have its own mental processes that still come before the response they are just much faster due to the urgency this is often because the mind acts separately without needing any intellectual analysis preferences or commentary such as if when a person senses something approaching their head they typically blink duck or block with their hands etc this too is a body functional intention as mental processes do not all run at the same speed some are much faster than others but the mind has to intend to blink duck or block etc as without the mind being aware and being able to knit the information together to make an instruction to the body how to react a reaction wouldn t happen explore how perception shapes intention perception shapes urgency so if it perceives danger or pain it adds greater importance and urgency to the action likewise if perception informs you not to like something such as feeling bored or hungry perception then influences intention to want to do something about the negative feeling likewise consider other things that can affect intention positively such as insight or negatively such as prejudice similarly how perception can receive a sensation mental or physical then from that feeling make a reaction and how our preferences or personal perception opinions can affect intention positively or negatively should be considered think about how intention affects objects for example a knife can be used in surgery to treat the wounded or in day to day tasks such as cooking or in artistic tasks such as carving but at the same time it can also be applied to harmful acts like killing injuring or threatening people the knife itself is just a lump of metal no more evil or innocent than any other object human beings or natural causes have created in itself it doesn t have a character or conscience before during or after it is used intention in design and manufacture can certainly make it look like it has a character or a power of its own but it s still just metal that might make other things consider why people generally don t notice intention intention happens many thousands of times in thousands of little ways for example when typing words the mind intends to type each letter in order so that it acts very quickly in order to cause the words to be typed accurately by the fingers this example can be expanded knowing where the keys are is important to be able to type each letter so the mind has to intend to move the hands to each letter s space on the keyboard to press it and release it then move on to the next letter all while glancing at the screen occasionally to ensure it is correct and at the same time breathe see smell feel etc this is high speed intention to do each part but the mind does it all on its own test this gradually as each action can be broken down into many smaller actions there is intention behind each one and sometimes many intentions happening very quickly you may intend to move your hand to pick up a glass but you have to keep the moving the arm and hand to pick up the glass intention until you perceive you have touched the glass by sight and or feel then that intention dies away as you don t need it anymore and a new intention to lift the glass to your lips comes into action or you can change direction and intend not to pick it up but then let go of it it s much like a movie the moving picture displayed on the screen happens because light is shown through a strip of thousands of static images all in an order showing their subtle changes this strip is put through a projector and run at high speed high enough to trick the mind to make many still pictures into a flowing moving image the mind simply isn t aware that the moving image on the screen is made of a lot of little images like a day is just a flow of many thousands of little intentions and actions find out how far intention goes in the actions it covers if you don t intend to do something the body can force you to do it by feeling pain exhibiting fear anxiety or distress or feeling hot or cold and so forth however intention is a conscious thing for example you can manipulate the manner in which you breathe and indeed you can intend to stop breathing and simply hold your breath or stop moving the muscles that make the lungs expand and contract likewise you can intend to not use the toilet or bathroom in each case though the body very quickly starts to protest at this and forces you to breathe again or to use the toilet as needed yet at the same time there are certain processes we cannot intentionally change such as our heartbeat digestive processes aging blood processing oxygen absorption through the lung tissue and getting rid of carbon dioxide expelling bodily waste products that soon become toxic through sweating to cool down etc the body needs to do some of these things to stay alive and healthy decide on whether you can influence intention be it emotional or psychological types of intention or bodily function types or intention given that there are many hundreds of intentions there are many that can be changed for the better and for the wiser such as in the case of an intention to be hateful or greedy manic or lazy if you keep observing your intentions until you can see the intention making you think feel or act you can also seek to modify that intention simply by using a conscious intention of a different kind such as intending to let go of a harmful chain of thought continue to evaluate intention try to see if some intentions are stronger than others which may trump another intention such as you may intend to make a phone call but the intention to go to the toilet bathroom is stronger so it trumps the desire to make a phone call sometimes unskillful or harmful intentions such as thinking about a thought that makes you depressed worried or angry can be pretty strong intentions so it needs a gentle compassionate but equally more dedicated and stronger intention to be both kind to yourself and to enable you to let go of the stressful thoughts or feelings by observing the process it s not long before you can be adequately disenchanted with a harmful intention thought or feeling in order to outweigh it and eventually this will become your new habitual approach to the negative thought or feeling it is all about building your understanding of intention into a useful tool as always knowledge is only of use if you do something with it find out if you can shape your intentions in order to make your life more happy healthy and less harmful can you train yourself to intend to be happier healthier and intend to avoid or let go of harmful things only by exploring it and studying your interaction with intentions can you find out,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to explore voidness and live beyond it,voidness is a complex object of study in philosophy because while it is a fundamental system of thought it has been used by many philosophers and metaphysicists on various levels utilizing many different terms to gain a firm understanding of it ideally it should be handled fearlessly by anyone who looks for truth as well as by those seeking to explore humanity and what constitutes the individual in order to discover who and what these concepts constitute here are some ways to explore voidness and to live through it,consider a bold theory for starters namely that voidness or emptiness occurs because it is in between what is there to us what we normally consider as us or me is an accumulated collective of memories knowledge habits culture and beliefs etc but the foundation for all of our consciousness is without a true or pre determined meaning theme or background and remains only an assumption made by our individual brains consider seeing the world for the first time then consider the knowledge and experience that has created all the layers that makes you as a person say this is me and mine yet even as a baby there are countless psychological processes and interactions that result in a you that was there before you were born if you were to take away all these aspects of you anything that remains would be meaningless or inhuman to you if you were to remove all your memories habits and all the things you identify as you you could not consider what is left behind because it is no longer within the realm of mundane human understanding and ideas in essence the identity of a person is dependent on a large variety of internal and external factors each of them impermanent and often acting individually or without our direct awareness and if these individual processes were put aside there is no remainder this philosophy may seem concerning because it requires us to re examine and re evaluate many of the cultural and personal ideas and attachments we have examine other living things just as animals react to similar things that we do such as reacting to hunger or feelings or temperature or to being confronted by an attacker animals can also plan and remember elephants have exceptional memory for places gorillas can learn to communicate using human methods crows recognize human faces and communicate this to other crows predators maintain hunting grounds etc note the similarities between human beings and their animal cousins how connected we are in our daily patterns and motivations and how little difference there is between us all we could pinpoint language as a unique trait but then dogs bark and howl birds twitter and squawk and there is a wide range of animal body language such as baring teeth tensing and puffing up which some animals including humans use to seem bigger and stronger etc words are just like programming code but body language is far more deeply ingrained like firmware to language s software consider that other animals have similar characteristics and functional abilities based in the genetic coding responsible for our hardware consider non living things is there purpose in stones water or even the world probe your own response to this question as underneath your assertions are a great many assumptions about the nature of the world and reality the concept of void ness would remind you that each assumption must be examined and its own arbitrary all together human foundation recognized until nothing remains socrates is possibly best known for the paraphrased quote i am the wisest because only i know that i know nothing there is a hidden meaning to this paradox in that it is not a paradox at all it is not one answer or the other but each reciprocally answering the other never settling on a single answer mastering this is key to understanding the void consider the scale of the universe from its galaxies and stars down to the tiny bacteria atoms and subatomic particles all these things change are impermanent and are independently in motion consider how the planets are racing though space around the sun or other stars if you keep expanding this perspective to take the stars into account and any planets they may have is there evidence or not of some plan or a great mover of those stars and planets as opposed to physics try to consider a weighted average between your experience and the views of others in this regard smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb 5 53 explore voidness and live beyond it step 3bullet2 jpg v4

then letting it go are there any demonstrable patterns that evidence where they are intended to end up voidness by nature puts into stark contrast that many of these design or plan questions may never be resolved because part of the question was without basis in what is actually occurring voidness in practice requires a person to put aside these questions in order to prevent bias or selective observation and that a person without opinion desire or preferences observe that things are simply as they are it might be possible that the universe was purposefully set in motion and left to its own devices much like a spinning top but then it might also be possible for the forces of physics to start it and keep it going without assistance it is a consistent variation between two main philosophies either a one option is that some entity set all of reality in motion or b another option is that physics every particle wave is acting as it must void of plan or controller impermanent changing and dynamic responding to cause and effect and that a true singular beginning is simply not evident but is a result of continuous change each option has demonstrable evidence in the eyes of individual observers however in this instance it is important to be aware when the observation and interpretation of such evidence is selective and or relative therefore a person must observe it as it is without bias or shaping try to find out which approach you consider most apt either by studying the vast universe and physics or life and the terrestrial animals of earth but always looking for a pattern or demonstrable evidence to support your theories einstein proved to his own satisfaction at least that everything came from nothing your own evaluations matter in your search for the truth as well as the views of others but it is wise to not depend on any one view for exploring your mind and the world the buddha who spoke much on the subject described the varying and opposing philosophies of his day many of which are mainstream today as a jungle of views a tangle of views while many tried to juggle and cut their way through them to find the facts for themselves the buddha realised it was necessary to abandon those which did not match what was real even if it was an enchanting or self empowering philosophy if a person was to continue to hold on to a firm set belief or hypothesis during their search for the facts or searching for an answer to a question tied to a belief structure they would not be able to have both philosophy therefore is about the scientific process of observation and analysis in relation to personal experiences and should not be about reaching absolute certainty while the laws of physics can be highly transcendental and enlightening it is the rare minority who go down that path as it is not self empowering nor inclining towards power or debate the concepts of the words absolute certainty are themselves neither absolute nor certain due to the universal nature of impermanence and change as it has been aptly said a little knowledge is a dangerous thing a person intent on researching this subject must not only consider both options to a deep level not a trivial level but at the same time accept that while there is many interpretations of life and the universe there is only this reality which is as it is work out what your feelings are in relation to the idea of void such as whether you find the idea of voidness scary comforting or strange and so forth if you feel anything at all try to find out what and why as well as how it influences your perception of all other things in life look where new emotions point you see if that changes anything you might find that if you feel uncomfortable it might be because you re handling a new idea but that s a good thing allow yourself to be stretched intellectually then ask yourself whether those feelings influence what you believe to be the nature of existence if you find the idea is liberating scary in its implications or want to see if your conclusions can be tested then look outside into the world stay mindful of the ideas you are looking for see if their patterns repeat with any significance in reality see how you can use your thinking and experiences to improve your life and make the world a better place consider in what way you will move beyond the voidness to continue engaging with the world by letting go of socially constructed thoughts and feelings and looking beyond them finally remember above all this in a world void of pre determined meaning you are free to make your own we have no choice about dying at some point but we get to choose how to live it is important to remember that by avoiding making our own path in order to follow another s interpretation or opinions we never develop deeply as human beings and life remains without depth potentially living with information that is all second hand as we have made no discoveries or insights of our own the knowledge gained by exploring voidness is knowing what promotes a happy healthy and peaceful life and what results in stress illness and strife there can be power dignity and honor in thinking for oneself and to co exist in harmony with one s environment good luck and have fun,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to explore words and live beyond them,there are times it seems we live off of live with and cannot seem to live without words language is slightly different to words although certainly connected language is used as a term to group a collection of words as well used as a way to identify other communities of people but words are surprisingly one of those things that can only take you so far and actually hinder both expression creativity our ability to connect with other people and understanding the greater dynamic of the mind to be able to pave a way for better well being deeper insight can occur without words this article focuses on not only how you can explore how words work but also live beyond them,determine when and where words are used as a basic starter words are often used primarily to identify or label things and then to describe and communicate these things both to ourselves and other people yet the word is not the thing the use of words is about being able to share an idea or feeling of the thing with others the words linking us with the object existing in the world and the concept in our mind but there are many other uses for words such as sharing an abstract idea with others like globalization or to explain our relationship to people or objects in a code form to be able to talk about subjects secretively and many others so try to explore those uses too consider also what makes you want to break out into words the immediate point of exploring the usage of words is that words don t need to be used all the time we might say it s a tomato but the word tomato is not actually the thing it s just a label and indeed many languages have different labels we give and gain emotions with words in many cases such as the word love but love is far more than words as are all the other feelings and ideas sometimes the use of words may be used to modify other feelings we may vent our anger by expressing with words and the amount of intention or stress of those words while studies have shown that we can tolerate pain longer by using very strong words the frequency or selection of words often can be chosen by neural pathways if we use a word a lot it is virtually a mental habit but there are cases where we get an emotional or biological response by selecting words sometimes the use of words can confuse and obfuscate the point being made because we have differing perceptions dependent on the words used consider for example cross cultural exchanges of words with speakers who have many words for rain the celtic irish many words for water the hopi or many words for cooking the same food item the japanese there are also many languages where words may have a gender of its own or to be used only by certain genders changing subtly or largely for the opposite sex in these cases the words used can give rise to very different perceptions dependent on the speaker s and listener s viewpoint words have allowed these cultures to be far more specific and descriptive on one level but at the same time can prevent communication more broadly test to see how you react to words we also instill words with emotions but frequently the word can act as a prompt in the brain to generate the same feeling and vice versa the mind reacts first which prompts a common word to express that feeling many words create an instant feeling such as violent or cozy or delicious words actually prompt the mind to feel something in our body sometimes the misuse pronunciation incorrect spelling in writing or grammar of words may affect people to quite a high extent a simple example was if you read the article was about how to do something but a tiny change to the article was about who to do something it suddenly makes no sense and is confusing or the article was about how to do something now can have a hugely different meaning simply with one letter out of place or changed about the article was something how to do strictly speaking has no changes at all except their order consequently words can make a subtle effect when the words aren t quite the same and can make a further effect if they are in bold italics or underlined try this simple test to see how the mind reacts to word groups examine some of the following word groups and see if they create any feelings or thoughts in you 1 different weird foreign 2 famous fashionable exclusive 3 yellow simple weather what do you feel about these words now add another word of your own choosing to those groups did that change the associated feeling or did you pick another word that meant the same so the feeling stayed the same the third group it is likely you would have felt confused and thought about a connection word to try to combine the others to make sense did the various feelings just happen on their own or did the words prompt the mind to make those feelings if you found that they had no effect on you at all try thinking about words that scare you or that make you want something write them down and consider why those words made you feel anything they are just bunches of letters and sounds after all so what is it that makes you react to them a similar application example is that a person might label another person by their culture age gender lifestyle belief system etc and become uncomfortable about them if not outright hostile they might be perfectly ordinary and friendly people that in circumstances where no words have been spoken one would be fine with this person but suddenly that label causes an uncomfortable feeling to arise and words become objects and consequently identifiers of prejudice and bias the word itself has become an expression and a symbol of ill will and there can be further dislike and distrust complications occasionally due to mis interpreted words it also works in the reverse labels can make a person seem more attractive and interesting and we can feel a sense of desire or respect towards those who certain labels are attributed to consider that we can be controlled or manipulated by words there is even a proper term known as neuro linguistic programming nlp which can sometimes be very effective with both positive and harmful results an example is we often are taught at an early age to avoid placing certain things in our mouths as they may be poisonous or a choke hazard which is a positive example but it might affect us later so after being told for example to avoid red berries when confronted with a tray of strawberries and red currants that we are likely to feel doubt as to if they are safe to eat many background examples come from our family friends etc and often by external advertisers this programming when we are young prompts us to act when older it is used very often in politics with negative campaigning to try to prevent the opponent being elected by focusing on their faults to prompt fear or loathing in the public likewise in a debate it is considered essential to not only convince people effectively with words but important strategically to move them towards the key point the debater wishes to make it s important to consider that its not always the events or things that worry us or cause us problems but our mental opinions of them words again that cause us more stress some words in the mind make us feel angry and can be used by others deliberately or unconsciously to inflame or frustrate us make us sad confused or ashamed where if we had the choice they wouldn t be happening some people may live in fear of words or being branded with them such as the words failure dumb useless etc look for obsessions with certain words that you might have there are schools of thought philosophy and political ideology that are obsessed or addicted with specific words which can be a hindrance to communication and looking beyond the scope to see what s really happening words are used to classify things or to lend identity status and belonging but this has its disadvantages it ultimately is important to explore how we can be manipulated by words but not just by others but positively by our own minds the mind uses words or phrases repeatedly to reinforce an assumption or belief often what happens is after a long time we accept it as true without ever considering if it may not be therefore it is important to see why it needs to reinforce something for if the assumption was true then it would be evident very often the mind is misleading us or we are misleading ourselves because we want to believe something look at the levels words take some are functional words such as kitchen pencil walking and so forth which don t create much resonance with you but some very selective words can provoke feeling there are many areas that focus on taking advantage of your responses to words mostly found in marketing words are often more effective when used in rhymes or associated mnemonics that can aid memory try to spot words or the way words are structured and selected to prompt you to feel or act a certain way advertising and public relations for example tend to have very high levels of research to select words effectively it may be a rhyme or jingle or a catchphrase as well as the speaker s accent tone and speed that will entice you most to want to buy their product remember their firm when you need equipment service or repairs or even to elect their politician what is it about these words and how they are used that makes you want to buy or alternatively annoy spur you enough into doing something words ultimately are used by us as individuals as a support foundation or component part of our identity that we use to reinforce our opinion of ourselves a young teenager wouldn t want to be seen using words used by older people or used by more intellectual people who aren t cool another key word that is very important to people the problem is when we become attached to words or certain words and forget that while the word is not the thing words as symbols and tools effectively can use abuse and control us because we value them and their meaning too highly consider how words help you and can be not only useful but beautiful the goal here is not to destroy words utterly there is beautiful poetry and knowledge also expressed in words which we would be at a loss without it is currently considered more or less impossible in dealing with everyday life to be without words and language is an amazing if imperfect thing but words are something that we make in order to describe identify or express what we see feel smell and so on endeavor to find out why words are such useful tools particularly in the context of your daily life it is wise to consider in an educational context that words in a lesson or the key message of a lesson only sinks in when it is relevant to a person often to get a major insight or moment when the penny drops and everything makes sense is when the right words are used at the right time and in the right order often a teacher may be pressing an important life message or a trainer teaching a new employee safety techniques but it never sinks in when the listener or reader is not paying attention because the subject is not relevant or interesting at the time to be relevant words can be very effective when used wisely for impact by considering how to make the lesson strike relevance in the individual the goal for educators is therefore to measure against their own experiences to find out what makes the subject interesting to themselves but also to see what does the student actually want and need when the teacher understands themselves better they improve their ability to instruct a student better and by using words far more effectively be a better educator explore the mental world of words ask yourself when you are having a long thought chain am i making or using these words are there cases where words happen randomly or in a pattern on their own the answer is quite surprising if you examine your thoughts for long enough because words may be used as a pacifier a distraction or a way to keep you engaged over a subject even if it causes you to feel stressed likewise the big question can i understand things without words a big part of maturing or developing is consciously thinking without using the labels we are comfortable with or uncomfortable with try to explore the world without words can you understand something just by seeing or hearing it experiencing without mentally describing or having a running mental commentary experiment with this when feeling an emotion or seeing a scene try not to describe it but just let the emotion be and explore it but explore it without words while a person may say observe it in its pure form the very word pure is another keyword that will affect that way you perceive things so likewise should be put aside for this experiment use your other senses and see what effect they make when a word inevitably comes to mind take a moment and replace it with an expanded understanding and note where the word might have failed you this can be particularly effective with generalities like bad good etc also try physical feelings just let them be and see what is happening if words aren t helpful then let them go in the same way that you would let go of a heavy bag you might find that without the words you might feel and see things more clearly which helps to lead to a far richer understanding language is constantly changing and developing when this becomes apparent you can see that actually life and the world has always operated pretty well without words look at everything again for the first time without using words see how much more you can explore life without them everything becomes new again every image will be subtly different every sound is different and so on because you are able to expand your mind and gain more from the experience you can see more of the finer details and how much of the vast world we live in that we miss on a daily basis you can reduce the amount of words you use when it is to your advantage and see beyond them,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to ask god for something christianity,you have something you want to ask god for but you don t know how to go about asking god hears your prayers but he doesn t always give you exactly what you ask for it s important to praise god and seek forgiveness for sins before you ask him to give you what you want ask god to work the way he wants also be honest and specific when you ask him for what you want be patient and believe that god will act,build a relationship with god god will hear your prayers whether or not you are following him but he is more likely to answer those who are close to him if you ve never started reading god s word and following jesus that s a good step before you ask him for something learn to listen and obey what he asks of you 1 x research source this is not to say that he won t grant your request if you aren t a follower it simply means that you ll be better able to communicate with him if you have a relationship with him think about the difference between a stranger and your best friend if a friend asks to borrow some money or a stranger on the street asks you d be more likely to give to your friend it s not a perfect comparison but it s similar praise god and give thanks first when you come to god in prayer don t go straight to asking for something it is better to praise him and thank him for what he has already done praise him for being loving and mighty thank him for guiding you and blessing you beginning this way shows god that he is more than someone you ask for things 2 x research source praise and thanks must be genuine not a tactic to butter god up so you can ask for what you want you must really mean what you pray start by saying god it s amazing how well you have taken care of me and provided for me i m thankful that you are strong and that you never turn away from me confess and repent of sin after you have a relationship with god it is important to make sure you re on good terms with him if you are living in ongoing sin or you ve committed sins recently you are separated from god you must confess those things and turn away from them this will mend the broken connection with god 3 x research source the reason this is important is that sin means going against what god wants from you when you sin you separate yourself from god to confess and repent simply means to tell god that you know you have sinned that you are sorry and that you want to change pray to god i m sorry i was so rude to my neighbor i know you love him too and i should treat him as you want me to i will work harder at being patient and kind to him ask god for forgiveness along with confessing and repenting ask god to forgive you for those sins seeking forgiveness is the step that has to follow confession once god has forgiven you the lines of communication will be much more open between you and god 4 x research source there is not a specific prayer of forgiveness you must pray tell god that you are sorry and that you want him to forgive you for wronging him pray god i m sorry for lying about what i did last night i should not have done that please forgive me for my dishonesty make amends with other people if you are angry or have hurt someone it s hard to pray an honest prayer to god take a minute to think about any relationships you have that are out of sync and make an effort to fix those first resolving problems with others opens you up more to asking something from god 5 x research source it s not enough to think of what s wrong if you don t make an effort to fix it get in touch with the person and seek reconciliation before going to god apologize to them or forgive them depending on what is wrong between you pray against evil that may be around you if you are living for god you may have evil that is against you holding you back from god pray that god would remove any spirits who seek to keep you distant and distracted from god spiritual warfare will keep you from being able to effectively communicate with god 6 x research source it may be worth your time to learn more about what spiritual warfare is and how it can affect your prayer life and living for god pray god i feel like there is evil that is surrounding me in jesus name please rebuke these spirits do not let them come between us tell them that they have no power over me be honest with god about what you are feeling god knows everything you think and feel so there is no sense in hiding as you are asking for what you want be completely honest about your thoughts and feelings honesty will open god s ears to your prayers ask god specifically for what you want tell god what you want or need and ask him to provide that for you be specific about your request even though god knows what you want and need he wants you to ask him for it god can answer vague prayers but being specific creates a deeper bond between you and him 7 x research source being specific does not guarantee that god will answer your request in the way you want him to he may have other plans for you say to god i m hurting for rent money this month because of the doctor bills please let me pick up some extra hours at work so that i can pay my rent remember that god will not give you something that goes against his will check your heart and check the bible to see if what you are asking for is against his will invite god to work in the ways he wants to work although you may have many specific things you want from god another good thing to pray is that his will be done in your life ask him to move and use you however he wants not only how you want ask him to help you want the things that he wants for you 8 x research source the benefits of praying in this way are many although you may know exactly what you want god may have much more for you than you could think to ask for if you only ask for the thing you want you could miss out on a larger blessing say to god lord i really want to start a new job this month but i know that you might have something more in store for me during this time i pray that you would show me your plans even if it isn t exactly what i want call on god to hurry in answering your request if you are asking god for something you probably want him to act quickly being honest with god means telling him that you want him to work quickly he is on his own time so it may not happen at the speed you want it is still good to ask him to hurry because you re being honest about what you want 9 x research source close by saying in jesus name the bible teaches that the name of jesus christ is powerful every time you pray but especially when you are asking for something end by saying i pray this in jesus name this acknowledges that god moves through jesus and that jesus is powerful 10 x research source this is not like saying magic words and it should not be used as a way to exploit god s blessings it is simply a way to show that you are submitting to god s will through christ be patient waiting for god to work remember that god works on a different timeline than you do if he doesn t answer as quickly as you hoped do not give up on him wait on his timing and remember that there may be a reason he does not answer as quickly as you want him to continue to praise him while you wait to hear god s answer to your prayer you must keep honoring him and giving him praise it is important to be be thankful and worshipful even when you haven t received what you want yet if you only praise him when he acts as you want your praise may not be genuine 11 x research source trust that god will act according to his will if you don t believe that god has the power to act your prayer loses power you must believe that he has heard you and will act based on his will if your request fits his plan then he will grant what you want but remember that god doesn t always answer the way you want him to 12 x research source,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to talk to god,talking to god involves a very spiritual personal often private relationship with so many religions and popular opinions about relating to god figuring out how you should talk to god may seem complicated but it doesn t have to be how you choose to connect and talk to god will simply boil down to what seems right to you no matter your spiritual preference or religion learning how to communicate effectively with god can be achieved with the following tips,determine how you see god you ll need to determine who god is to you in order to confidently talk to god who is and how do you define god do you know god as a fatherly or motherly figure a teacher a distant or a close friend sticking closer than a sister or brother or is god an abstract spiritual guide is your connection to god rooted in a personal spiritual relationship you have with god or do you follow the form and order of your religion to understand who god is to you whichever is true for you will dictate how you view and talk to god and however you see god determines how you will approach god to talk to him as you see him 1 x research source establish a relationship with a caring god it s easier to talk to someone when you persist to establish a speaking relationship with a person that really cares 2 x research source so your telling god your burdens and joys helps bond your relationship with god figuring out that god wants to hear from you and to share all your joys pains and thoughts with you is the first step to establishing that relationship and you can build on it by reading about how much god cares in spiritual literature or religious texts such as the bible quran or torah talk to god as you would a close loving but all powerful friend talking to god as a tremendous friend is different from just praying to god as a need or duty as with a friend you expect back and forth communication by noticing how god answers helps or teaches you 3 x research source while prayer may be more of a one way transaction talking implies a conversation you can talk to god out loud or inside your mind whichever feels most effective to you it may be best to find a quiet or private space you can occupy in order to concentrate while you re talking if you can t it s okay to talk silently to god while you re standing in the checkout line at the grocery store sitting in a waiting room or while you re at work or school etc have a talk with god talk to god similarly as you would if a physical person were standing in front of you you can talk to god about your daily troubles your thoughts at the moment your hopes and dreams and even tell him and tell yourself the things for which you re thankful you can tell god about casual or hard topics just as you would with a concerned friend let s say for example you were having an ongoing argument with a friend you could say god i m not sure what else to say to charlie we ve been arguing for almost two weeks now and we still can t come to an agreement i don t want to think we can t get through this but i don t know what more to do or say ever been amazed by a crazy beautiful day talk to god about his gifts to you wow god it s so beautiful outside i d love to spend the day reading in the park maybe you have a difficult relationship with a family member i hate that my mom and i don t get along she just doesn t understand me and she refuses to listen when i try to tell her how i really feel i pray that she would try to see things from my point of view sometimes and help me to be patient listen and understanding to her watch for and pay attention to possible feedback you may not get an audible response like you would if a friend were physically standing in front of you but you can receive a response from god in the written word of god or from the sermon of a minister anticipate it to also come in the form of an intuition an inspiration a scripture a situation or an event that directly or indirectly relates to what you ve been talking about to god 4 x research source tell god that you know that he has his own reasons for his seemingly hands off response and his timeline and so trust him in that you may not find what you want when you want it but he does everything for his reason try to keep following god s path in good faith in the loving concepts of god and expressing god s goodwill but realize that whatever happens may be a result of a third person s involved in their self centered personal actions inaction or their doing the opposite of some of your ideas and needs god does not necessarily contravene or interfere with the behavior of disagreeable parties why they having free will as you do might not follow love good morals the purposes of god nor stop their misconduct that can involve you events could thus depend regrettably on their dangerous uncaring intersections with your hopeful and peaceful path even in dire events one can talk to god in the darkest day or when you pass through the valley of death you need not fear but may cry out to him while trusting god come what may write to god as a form of communication maybe you feel uncomfortable talking out loud to god find it difficult to concentrate when talking to god in your mind or maybe neither of the two work for you at all if that s the case try writing to god this form of communicating will still enable you to express your thoughts for a connection and create your side of a conversation with god 5 x research source purchase or find a blank writing notebook and pen choose something that will feel comfortable to write in every day a spiral notebook or journal would be an ideal choice since it will easily lay flat on a desk select your preferred writing tool you ll want to write to god by hand instead of typing on a computer computers have endless distractions and for some the act of typing requires more conscious effort than scribbling in a notebook 6 x research source find a quiet and private space to write even though you won t be speaking aloud it s still best to find a quiet spot for maximum concentration write for a specific amount of time before you get started set a timer for a length of time that feels comfortable to write for you may set it for five ten or twenty minutes keep your pen or pencil moving until the timer goes off write fast and freely try not to be self conscious about what you write don t worry about grammar and punctuation or about what you re actually writing in writing to god you want your words to come from the heart in order to do that you ll need to relax enough that you can write freely about whatever comes to mind write to god as if you re writing a letter to a friend or as if you re writing in a private journal if you re not sure what to write about consider writing about a current concern that you can t stop thinking about write about what s happening in your day to day life write down any questions you want god to answer for you or write about your goals or what you re thankful for use the examples below for inspiration dear god i have no idea what i m doing in my life right now i can t seem to make good choices or meet the right people i feel like i m drowning in drama when will this end when will things change for me i can t even contain my excitement right now god today i met a woman who works at my dream job our meeting was completely serendipitous i mean what are the chances of meeting just the right person randomly on a busy street if i didn t accidentally bump her shoulder and if she didn t happen to drop her purse i never would have gotten a glimpse of her business card you ve truly answered my prayers set aside time to pray to god prayer can be considered a more formal way to talk to god because it is primarily rooted in religion however you can choose to pray in whatever way feels comfortable to you while you can pray at any time and in any place it helps to set aside specific times of the day to pray 7 x research source choose a time when you are unlikely to be disturbed and you ll be able to center yourself and pray effectively common times for prayer include before meals or bed after waking during stressful times or periods of need and during solo activities like exercising or a commute 8 x research source find a quiet room or space to pray ideally praying to god should occur in a place where you ll be able to tune out distractions during the few minutes it takes to pray if you can t find a quiet place to pray don t worry you can pray on busy city buses in the middle of crowded restaurants and anywhere you can center yourself you can pray while you re driving down the highway as long as you stay focused on the road while you pray prepare for prayer as you get ready to pray some people like to take a few minutes to prepare the space and the self for communicating with god 9 x research source the way that you choose to prepare for prayer will largely be up to your own personal preferences and or religious traditions some common practices might include reading a few applicable verses of a religious text lighting candles or incense performing a cleansing ritual taking communion meditating quietly chanting or singing decide what you want to pray about this can be done beforehand if there is a pressing matter happening in your life or it can be determined as you pray 10 x research source you could use prayer as a means to have a casual conversation with god about daily happenings or current events here s an example god today is my first day of class i m really nervous but also excited i pray that everything goes well today you could use prayer as a way to confess or get something off your chest or you could pray for a request or a need god i feel horrible that i gossiped about a coworker i m afraid she s found out and i don t know what to do to fix it please forgive me also please give me the strength to ask her for forgiveness let s say you ve just interviewed for a job you could say thank you god for a great interview please let the interviewer see how perfect i am for this position and decide to hire me pray in a way that feels natural to you there s no one right way to pray prayer should be unique to the individual believer who is praying while praying in a church or worship center is often quite stylized and ritualized when you re praying alone you don t have to follow any particular rules other than opening yourself up to god and speaking from the heart some people like to bow their heads in prayer and close their eyes while other religions will practice full prostrations or kneeling whatever seems most respectful and effective for you and your personal relationship with god is fine you can pray with your eyes open and your head high just as it s fine to pray kneeling and silent it s common to recite some traditional prayers out loud but it s also very common to pray silently to yourself pray with others it can be a powerful experience to pray with a group of like minded individuals this can be an excellent way to hear how others relate to god and learn new traditions and rituals that you can integrate into your own prayer practice if you don t currently have a group to pray with try to find one 11 x research source you can find a group in a local worship center or church you attend you can do a search online for people who share your beliefs to see if there are meetups happening in your area if you can t find what you re looking for consider starting your own prayer group in some religions prayer groups practice sending group prayers to friends and loved ones in need prayer lists are often created regularly to pray for the sick and needy members of a

how to meditate on the word of god,meditation is often associated with eastern religions or new age practices but it plays an important role in the christian faith as well one of the most effective ways to meditate as a christian is to do so on the word of god unlike other forms of meditation that require emptying your mind this form requires you to dive in and think deeply on god s truth,define meditation in a christian context in a secular context meditation is associated with emptying the mind and relaxing the body on the other hand meditating on the word of god or any other form of christian meditation requires you to concentrate and think deeply on god s truth 1 x research source consider god s words to joshua in joshua 1 8 niv keep this book of the law always on your lips meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it then you will be prosperous and successful while this verse technically only refers to what christians consider the first five books of the bible you can still apply this idea to meditating on the entire bible meditating on god s word should be done frequently and the overall purpose should be to enrich your understanding so you can apply it to your life meditate on one verse or paragraph this is probably the most common way to meditate on the bible identify a single verse or paragraph within the word of god to meditate over you ll need to dissect and explore the meaning of that verse during a concentrated amount of time 2 x research source there s no wrong choice but if you re not sure where to start a good spot might be a verse from the new testament especially one from one of the four gospels matthew mark luke and john with regards to the old testament the book of psalms and book of proverbs also contain great verses to meditate over center meditation around a specific topic another option worth trying would be to choose a topic explored at length in the bible instead of meditating over one specific passage you ll need to identify several passages that deal with this topic and think deeply on how the supporting passages define or elaborate on it 3 x research source for example you might focus on the topic of forgiveness use a topical bible or index to find different verses on forgiveness then read through as many as possible look at the context surrounding each verse and compare them to one another focus on the meaning of one word this option is related to meditation on a specific topic but instead of dealing with a broad topic you ll need to rely on the context of one or more passages to help enrich your understanding of the meaning of a significant word 4 x research source for instance you could choose the word lord look at verses with the word lord in them as well as verses that contain the lowercase version of lord consider the contextual meaning of the term for both spellings you may also supplement your understanding by using external resources like a dictionary to compare religious use to secular use of the term study one book of the bible using this technique you ll need to devote a longer amount of time to reading a full book of the bible instead of merely focusing on one short passage dissect and explore the significance of that book looking at the book as a whole and at individual pieces of it a little at a time 5 x research source if this seems intimidating to you consider starting with a relatively short book like the book of esther you may even wish to supplement your understanding with the use of a bible study guide but doing so isn t necessary find a quiet place like secular forms of meditation mediating on the word of god requires you to set yourself apart from the noise and distractions of the world long enough to focus on the task at hand 6 x research source multitasking may seem like a valuable skill in today s world but you won t be able to give any task 100 while trying to balance it with something else minimizing your distractions while meditating on god s word should improve your ability to focus on it try to set aside at least 15 to 30 minutes for your meditation let any family or roommates know that you need time to yourself to focus and set yourself apart in a quiet empty room make yourself comfortable but not so comfortable that you find it hard to stay awake quiet your heart external silence isn t the only quiet required for this form of meditation you also need to pursue internal quiet by setting aside your doubts fears and other distracting thoughts 7 x research source don t feel too guilty if your mind initially wanders back to the day s problems but don t let your thoughts dwell there either as soon as you notice yourself getting sidelined by anxieties or other concerns take a moment to pause and consciously redirect your attention back to god praying for rededicated focus at that moment may also help read the bible open the bible and read the verse or verses you plan to meditate over spend as much time as you need to gain a basic understanding of the words then bookmark the verse for later you ll need to refer to it continually throughout your meditation 8 x research source after you read through the passage try reading through it again this time speak the words out loud and intentionally emphasize different portions by your tone and open yourself to new revelations as you do so repeat this exercise as often as needed or desired during your meditation if necessary you may also wish to improve your understanding using other tools research the cultural context read through verses that are similar in tone or topic look up unfamiliar words in a dictionary or thesaurus pray over the readings spend a few minutes praying to god for guidance on your meditative efforts ask god to open your heart to the truth and wisdom lying within his word 9 x research source while the bible may seem like little more than words on a page try to keep in mind that the text you read comes direct from god asking the holy spirit to enrich your understanding while you meditate is essentially like asking an author to help improve your understanding of his story take notes read through your chosen passage again but this time take notes on its content you may wish to highlight underline or write short notes directly in on the page but you should also keep a dedicated journal so that you can take more extensive notes 10 x research source highlighting ideas can redirect your attention to key elements during later readings but actually writing notes on each verse will make it easier for you to think through it summarizing ideas and responding to them in this manner forces you to think fully on the words in front of you think out loud even though your space and heart should be quiet don t be afraid to think out loud talking over the passage can help you process the information and work through its mysteries more effectively 11 x research source you can think out loud in the form of a prayer but you can also think out loud to help yourself work through complex ideas the bible is often referred to as the living word of god as suggested by the term living the text is meant to be active which also means that you can and should interact with it don t be afraid to vocalize your questions praise god s promises or respond honestly to the things you read memorize the words while this won t be feasible for meditation on multiple verses or full books it s often a good idea to memorize the passage word for word when meditating over a short paragraph or single verse 12 x research source consider using the building block method of memorization repeat one word or short phrase roughly 6 to 12 times add new words or phrases onto the first then repeat the entire thing again continue until you work through the full passage rephrase the chosen passage spend some time writing out the meaning of the passage in your own words go into as much detail as possible drawing out as much meaning as you can find in the process paraphrase the passages you read by putting them into your own words but remember to stay true to the meaning behind god s words as you do this the idea isn t to alter or twist the truth but to access it in more familiar terms evoke an emotional response think through the passage on which you re focusing try to pinpoint god s desires as expressed through those words and attempt to align yourself with those desires so you can feel some degree of what god feels 13 x research source by allowing yourself to feel emotion alongside god you can make the passage you re reading seem more real to yourself which should create a richer experience instead of merely looking like text on a page god s words should seem notably more meaningful as meaningful as they were always meant to be actively seek the blessings of meditation like secular meditation meditating on god s word can provide you with a renewed sense of calm but the blessings of this meditative practice can extend even deeper than that as you meditate seek guidance comfort joy reassurance and wisdom that come from an enriched understanding of divine truth 14 x research source as psalm 1 1 3 niv notes blessed is the one whose delight is in the law of the lord and who meditates on his law day and night meditating on god s word will give you a greater

how to understand and develop insight,insight as a means to develop understanding features strongly in a range of eastern and western philosophies as well as the arts and sciences developing insight for example is a main component to developing buddhism which is often called vipassana essentially insight is the best way to learn more about a subject about life and if we are specialized to end stress and understand the mind and body dynamic as a whole rather than bits of our emotions thoughts and reactions this article provides one guide to developing your own insight as well as how to apply the understanding gained to life s problems,seek to understand what insight is insight in essence is both knowledge and understanding derived from an inward sight or more simply looking inside your own mind and body and observing it it can be a natural process or an intentional process as sometimes you need to see things differently to see them clearly but most important is knowing which lens or style to use to make it clear when seeing and studying something you might gain an understanding on how and why it happens simply by seeing it as it happens and not passing judgement the more you watch and the greater your depth of observation the more information you can pick up knowledge is the understanding that is gained and is the part that you can use 1 x trustworthy source association for psychological science nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences go to source in its simplest example you might learn that fire is hot but only through touching its heat likewise if you don t remember that it s harmful and use that knowledge next time you reach to pick up something hot you will burn yourself the skill is all about developing insight so it becomes more than basic survival skills but a way to improve skills and our quality of life and learn things on a much deeper level of understanding start to consider ways to be able to observe your subject general mindfulness and meditation is a classic format when observing the mind and body but also for any subject you wish such as when gazing at a beautiful garden complex poetry or art or when studying a recipe book instruction manual or textbook its best to be aware that meditation or any means used to gain an inward perspective typically consists of two things 1 the initiation of a laboratory like or study field literally the moment you pay attention to it generally everyone has practiced observation and had insights of various degrees throughout their life but it generally is on a superficial level until the person decides to get to the bottom of the matter or when they have observed so much of the subject it is more apparent 2 when practiced to the degree of deep focus or absorption meditation allows the mind to become far more clear calmed and focused and can look at things without distortions or personal agendas 2 x research source consider this metaphor seeing a sample under a microscope is a lot more detailed and focused than just looking at the sample in the hand developing the mind through meditation as well as other methodologies both sharpen your focus and gives you a clearer boundary on the thing you focus on however it would be inaccurate to conclude that very deep meditation is the only way to the goal itself although it certainly does help you might see the finer detail through a microscope certainly but an example to consider is how expert geologists can tell the quality and type of soil in their hand just through the naked eye or by using specific gravity tests and other chemical analyses these skills are learned through experience and testing their understanding they might have used a microscope in their training and career or they might never have done so in this instance it is like a bird with two wings observation such as meditation is one wing examining and understanding is the other wing if the bird has only one wing it can t fly well it will just go round in circles learn about some of the traps and misconceptions that can block the attainment of insight they typically arise more in an intentional guided or an intensive style of study practice rather than those rare but life changing insights that simply happen if you are familiar with them you can at least recognize them when they happen and if they do pop up arguably you can learn even more if you turn your attention to these very obstacles there is occasionally the idea that the means to the end is actually the end itself the complication here is the process or relationship to the process has become more important than focusing on the subject this can be quite a common experience many go through and some do end up going to universities and colleges all their life or studying the mind in meditation in a routine style but never really making any breakthroughs try not to rush things this is another common challenge as people hope to find a magic switch to get full understanding on their subject be it science psychology arts literature and so on or a cure for their troubles as the metaphor goes when the penny drops in the mind and things make sense this often takes time to happen naturally however repeated observation and testing not only helps the penny drop sooner but also the extent of the insight is broadened and many different facets can of the same experience can become clear in this way a person can learn to think and act more creatively and skilfully some also end up stuck with nowhere to go when the insight or knowledge gained is presumed as the goal itself insight is just one half of the story the other half is doing something with it consider that a surgeon through his or her experience designs a new scalpel or forceps but it s only until these tools are used in surgery that they are going to be useful in the same way care must be taken to continuously apply and test any insights gained as well as how to use them as practical tools which in itself can expand the depth of understanding the application of understanding relationships is most important and it goes awry when people prefer to focus on the intellectual rather than the practical for example a chemist might discover a new medicine through testing samples but if the treatment is never made available or ever taken by the patient it does nothing the medicinal discovery itself does not destroy the disease in the same way you have to apply your understanding to achieve the goal for the discoveries are just a means to an end develop your levels of observation and the subsequent knowledge that arises test it out observe and study your subject be objective and look at everything as if you have never seen it before observe it as if it s a totally unique thing but most importantly observe your relationship or interaction with the experience and the object the ways we can learn the most about a subject as well as how to gain the best outcome is to observe our relationships how do we feel about the experience is the mind open or closed to the experience this helps you observe life more completely rather than being selective or allowing parts of the mind to cloud the issue 3 x research source ask yourself often to identify what you see as you might not always know even if you do identify it but a secondary feeling or idea arises then identify that as well once you can identify them you can explore them just like once you ve identified the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle you can start to put the puzzle together and you can gain practical understanding and skills luckily in essence there are very few cases when the solution to many of our life challenges aren t already within the problem we experience or in essence our relationship with the problem by exploring the foundation of the problem a solution can be found or if a solution is simply impossible then a person can then start to come to terms with accepting the realities of life and finding a silver lining or creative opportunity if they are practical in life aspects many of our frustrations unhappiness depression and sorrows happen because we aren t looking at things completely and applying our understanding or observing the issue to understand it generally it is wise to go back to the beginning and examine the central facts and test those in relation to what you see you might be studying to gain an insight into a maths project but if you are too tired or not interested then it is useful to identify this feeling as this is your relationship with the subject be sincere sincerity is actually deep in the practice and benefits of understanding if you are seeing something that is real and can be retested to give the same result then you will have to satisfy yourself that it is what it is it might mean consequently you have to let go of other ideas or wishes but ultimately that is up to you to let them go because you cannot progress beyond these hurdles you have to climb over them until you can leap over them 4 x research source keep observing the subject in order to improve both the depth of understanding and observation for example it took a while until you could repeat the alphabet without error some people can learn it quickly but these are very rare people so it pays to keep observing and learning very often things can suddenly make sense like a light bulb moment even things you have seen dozens of times before through life experience your mind develops the tools needed to put together pieces of the puzzle as well as identify different angles and ways that the experience can be improved the mind is often able to relate what has been seen to prior experiences in order to make connections by using an inward observation eventually even this tool and skill gathering becomes apparent find practical uses for insight the ultimate goal is to become intimately familiar with your mind and body how it reacts to certain things and how they inter relate the key benefit to knowing your mind so well is that you can take one glance at something and know instantly if it s of benefit or harm you may then let go or avoid things that are harmful it takes time but it gets more effective the more you practice it you learn more each time you examine something in a relationship context insight and mindfulness as the two wings of the bird are useful everywhere at work school home and all times in between it has clear uses in empathy being able to understand the challenges and issues we and other people face and then relating and acting appropriately 5 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source in a work or business context insight is also incredibly useful in any area requiring creative thinking as well as conflict resolution many of our problematic relationships between co workers or between boss and employees arise because we don t understand each other and the pressures both sides experience it s these pressures and how we interact with them that limit compromise and flexibility so by applying our insights we can find a middle ground as well as new ideas in a mental well being context there comes a stage in most people s lives that the desires of our chattering mind becomes a common thread in the tapestry of life as well the understanding that it makes us unhappy and dissatisfied with what we have dawns upon us insight is important here in understanding how to let go of shallow desires by correctly identifying your true needs as a stress relief tool eventually what insight helps us to do is to learn what stress actually is how to let it go of it as well as forgive it and to become so practiced in both recognizing and letting go that you just release stress without trying then you are free of so many of your daily troubles in a quality of life tool what insight practices do eventually reveal is that every moment is absolutely unique and new that every experience is fresh even when we are tired depressed and frustrated this insight on its own rejuvenates the observation as its not like watching a tv show over and over although it may seem like it its always different perennially interesting and an opportunity to learn and understand some amazing things f,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to walk by faith,scripture explains that christians must walk by faith not by sight 2 corinthians 5 7 it can be difficult to know what a walk of faith requires though,have faith in the promises you cannot see most of the promises god makes to those who follow him are not tangible so you won t be able to see proof of those promises with your own eyes you must believe that god will keep those promises as an act of faith rather than one of sight 1 x research source as stated in john 3 17 18 for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved by the condemning of his son he who believes in him is not condemned but he who does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god simply put accepting christ as your savior and as the son of god will lead you to salvation as stated in matthew 16 27 for the son of man will come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he will reward each according to his works if you live by the will of god in other words walking in faith and by faith you will receive the salvation promised to the believers and followers of christ consider the limitations of walking by sight walking by sight limits your experience to things that can only be experienced by sight once you realize how limiting this is the benefit of walking by faith can become much clearer imagine what life would be like if you never planned to travel anywhere beyond the destinations you can see from your bedroom window you wouldn t get very far and you would be missing out on everything the world had to offer likewise if you never plan to travel anywhere beyond the tangible realm you won t get very far and you ll miss out on everything that the spiritual realm has to offer let go of your fear the world can be a frightening place and sometimes you may do things out of fear that contradict god s will if you want to walk by faith you need to release your fear to god and accept the path he leads you down this is easier said than done of course you may not be able to become completely fearless but you can be courageous and learn to act according to god s will even when you are afraid of what lies ahead focus on things that have eternal significance it s easy to fixate on aspects of your earthly life finances possessions and so one these things disappear along with the mortal body though and have no lasting spiritual value a big house or a fancy car are things the world might value but they won t matter in god s kingdom earthly success is not inherently evil you can live a comfortable life in a nice home with a good job and still walk by faith the problem isn t in having these things the problem is prioritizing these symbols of earthly success over matters of the spirit instead of focusing on the life before you focus on unseen realities like jesus and heaven center your life around these realities instead of the visible temporary realities of your earthly life store up treasures in heaven by doing the will of god as instructed in matthew 6 19 20 rather than fussing over the treasures of earth obey the bible and god s commands living your life according to your faith in god will require you to follow god s law above and before the ways of mankind god s law can be learned and understood through the study of his word understand that there are times when the world will try to convince you that something forbidden by god s law is acceptable human inclination is follow the ways of the world but to walk by faith you need to follow the ways of god you cannot control the actions of those around you but as far as your own life is concerned you must live according to what god has deemed is right and just prepare to look foolish for those who walk by sight the actions and beliefs of a person who walks by faith can seem foolish you ll need to learn to walk on in spite of any criticism you receive from those around you god s ways are not humanity s ways your natural inclination will be to follow your own understanding and the current philosophy of human society but doing so will not guide you down the path god wants you to follow proverbs 3 5 6 explains trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he shall direct your paths expect to face trials along the way every road has rough patches and the one you re setting out on now is no exception the trials you ll face are there to give your journey strength and meaning though 2 x research source the trials you face might be self inflicted or may not be your fault at all you might stumble and give into the temptation to do what you know to be wrong and dealing with the consequences of your actions can make things difficult for a while even so god will not abandon you he can even use the evils of your hardship for your good if you let him on the other hand a natural disaster or some other unforeseen uncontrollable force might rip through your life god can and will use that tragedy for the greater good though as long as you are open to it stop waiting for an epiphany there might be times when you feel the presence of god very vividly but there will also be times when you feel a sense of distance between you and god you need to keep walking by faith through these dark times without waiting for some epiphany or miracle to illuminate your path 3 x research source realize that god is always with you even when you do not feel his presence or understand how he is working in your life through a particular tragedy or disaster the feeling of being deserted is a matter of human perception and not a matter of truth god speaks to the spirit but while you are still in bodily form there will be times when the perceptions of the body drown out those of the spirit when you are desperate to feel the presence of god but are unable to do so rely on the promises of scripture and your past faith experiences to give you strength continue to pray and to do the things you know god would have you do glorify god in all that you do you do not need to be a famous evangelist to walk by faith and give glory to god simply do the best you can with the tasks and circumstances god has given you first corinthians 10 31 explains whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of god if something as basic as eating and drinking can be done to the glory of god more complex aspects of life can be done to the glory of god as well if you re currently a student study seriously and be the best student you can be if you re working at an office be a responsible ethical and hard working employee be the best son daughter mother father sister or brother you can be to your family members as well pray through all stages of life prayer offers you a direct channel of communication to god to stay committed to a walk of faith you need to keep talking to god through both the good times and the bad if you find yourself forgetting to pray try scheduling a specific time each day for it when you wake up in the morning during your lunch hour before bed or any other time when you can get a few minutes of silence and solitude you might find yourself forgetting to give praise and thanks during good times even though you have no trouble turning to god for help during times of need the reverse may also be true if you have a weak point in your prayer life focus on strengthening it listen for direction for the most part you ll need to walk through life and make decisions based on what you already understand about who god is and what god wants for you keep your mind open however so that you will be able to interpret messages and signs from god when they do come along you might be given direction without even knowing it when you lose your job it could be god s way of directing you down a better path when a relationship ends it could be god s way of directing you to a healthier relationship or to a goal that could not have been completed if you remained with that individual follow god s schedule god will answer your prayers but the answer may not come in the time frame you would expect it to similarly god will open the right path for you but that path will only be revealed when god decides that it is the best time for it this can be especially difficult when the demands of daily life press down on you it can be hard for example to trust in god s schedule when you can t find a job and have bills to pay no matter how tough things get though try to remind yourself that god is with you through it all and will lead you to where you need to be when you need to be there according to his plan give thanks be thankful for the blessings god has given you taking time to notice all the good things in your past and present can strengthen your faith and make it easier to keep walking when the path seems dim giving thanks for the things that are obviously good may seem simple enough but you also need to give thanks for the trials and roadblocks you face along the way god wants only the best for you so even the hardships you face are ultimately there for your benefit care for the things god gives you treat all of the good things in your life as the blessings they are keep in mind that this includes both obvious blessings and those you may often take for granted if you ve been unemployed for a long time and the right job suddenly comes your way it might be an obvious blessing you should take care of it by working hard and doing your best a healthy working body is a big blessing that many people often take for granted though take care of your body by eating right and doing what you can within reason to stay healthy serve others as a disciple of christ you have been instructed to serve and spread the love of christ to others doing so pleases god and can be spiritually enriching to you donating money food clothing and other material objects to the needy is one way to serve others serving others also means donating your time to help those around you loved ones strangers and even people you don t like seek the fellowship of other believers no one can walk this journey for you but this road is one that can be much easier to follow when in the presence of good company go to church and seek out friends and allies there try attending a bible study or a faith based group if you need something more than that other believers can help you stay accountable and on the right path likewise you can do the same

ideas and subjects to find coherence and or arguments this is akin to putting a jigsaw puzzle together some pieces will fit and others won t choose a type of philosophy philosophical thought is organized around many types of philosophies including axiology ontology aesthetics epistemology ethics logic metaphysics and political theory follow your interests feel free to choose more than one type because you see particular linkages you will enjoy thinking through how to meld them successfully 1 x research source after deciding a philosophy type learn the background history of your chosen philosophy including readings from the key philosophers understand the key questions that were addressed and get a solid understanding of the key concepts improve your basic understanding of other types of philosophies you cannot be an expert in everything but recognize that there is great value in understanding the basics of what others have done a broad understanding of what people are struggling with and what the discussions have been about will help you to develop your own personal philosophy feel free to learn and build on existing ideas it is difficult starting from scratch so why not take another philosopher s ideas as a basic framework to get started many well known philosophers started like this for example plato took the undoubtedly oral and sociable socratic method from the real socrates 2 x research source and used it as the basis for his highly polished literary socratic method which in turn was taken by aristotle to form the basis of logic particularly syllogisms 3 x research source expand and evolve your thinking the framework you have selected is a starting point as you experience life test it out and see what works for you and what doesn t when you have time analyze this and refine your framework philosophy over time as you solve problems and assess the quality of the decisions you have made you will be able to evolve from where you started into something autonomous of the original philosophy become a critical thinker keep track of where you have obtained the basis for ideas tenets theories etc in your new philosophy being able to trace your theorizing or conclusions back to their source will help you defending your ideas or pushing them further very little develops in a vacuum 4 x research source referring to what other philosophers have said gives your philosophy greater credibility because you are displaying your depth of knowledge and understanding of existing philosophies be patient and allow your ideas to percolate over time

something autonomous of the original philosophy keep a journal and continue writing down your thoughts and ideas even if they re not coherent patience is essential because it may take you years to sort through all the discarded notions to find the treasure buried underneath the passage of time is healthy as it allows your ideas to keep evolving and to be tested by daily events ask some pertinent questions such as what is the purpose of your philosophy do you want to apply it to all of society or just a sector what is your role in your philosophy what if any are the roles of particular people in your philosophy how will you explain the basis of your philosophy to others is it helpful on a practical level or utopian how do other belief sets or philosophies fit in with or go against your philosophy are you willing to write down a thesis or book of your philosophy or would you rather write stories that contain your philosophy but are not overtly a philosophical work in structure talk to others interested in philosophy they can point out faults you might have missed and give different solutions this is helpful for developing your philosophy join a local philosophy group club or chapter join an online group that has private forums where you can share your ideas freely and get responses visit your local university and ask to speak with philosophy professors to share your thoughts with them if you find someone else who really understands where your new philosophy is headed embrace their enthusiasm but take care to keep working on your understandings separate from their enthusiasm it is hard to follow someone else while they are still working out what it is that they believe so their enthusiasm may just be because they like and trust you actively find seek out new experiences to help you to see things in different ways and from different angles keep an open mind learn to accept criticism and grow from it it might just help strengthen you and your philosophy always have a pencil and a notebook to note down ideas as they occur to you or you come across them keep reading philosophy it will allow you to see previous philosophers attempts what they found and what fallacies they fell into thus progressing your own philosophy this will also help you to see whether or not you are attempting something that a previous philosopher has already tried keep up to date with the world try reading a newspaper once in a while it ll help you apply theories to real situations for example take a serious news story that involves issues impacting on many sectors of society and ask yourself what would i have done work your answers into your developing philosophy to see if it can withstand actual events and provide explanations instruction or greater understanding see yourself as a philosopher whether or not you work as one a career in philosophy or similar roles such as a researcher in a think tank or institute will ensure you dedicate regular time to your philosophy but for the part time philosopher make sure you dedicate enough time to it so you keep improving and don t forget bits of your work 5 x research source try as much as possible

how to deprogram a religious cult member,it can be frightening when a loved one joins a cult you may not know what to do or how to help them here is how to encourage them to think independently and to keep their heads,notice signs of a cult some religions are very community based or unusual but this does not automatically make the group a cult they spend time only with other members pushing everyone else away they don t trust anyone other than their superiors within the group they try to convince family and friends to be a part of their group they don t have normal conversations about anything other than god their group leaders or the salvation available only within the group recognize that good reasonable people can end up in cults vulnerable people are at risk many of them are lonely and lacking in confidence and are naive and idealistic many people who fall victims to cults are well adjusted 1 x research source someone facing instability in their lives bright people with no sense of direction people facing problems such as a bad breakup or personal failure people with problems at home research cults it can help to have a better understanding of the institution that your loved one has fallen victim to find out how cults work so you know what the person is facing keep lines of communication open the cult may try to shut you away from the person don t give them any excuses tell the person that you re there for them and they can contact you any time 2 x research source spend time with your loved one the cult leader hopes that you ll do something drastic that will make the person shun you don t do that 3 x research source instead be there for them and be kind invite them to hang out with you send cards emails or letters keep showing your love mention other friends and loved ones this helps remind the person that their old life is still there for them and they can come back to it for example jean is holding a party on saturday and she s hoping you can come and your brother said he misses you 4 x research source be patient the person may believe that the world revolves around their cult however they are unlikely to be open to other ideas unless they come to them be loving and non judgmental being pushy or confrontational may lead to their resenting you and strengthen their faith in the cult they may consider your efforts religious persecution be kind loving even to strangers and understanding with them take them on vacation if you can a cult keeps people in by its magnetizing and entrancing environment so if the person gets away from this environment they ll have space to think and reflect 5 x research source a place with limited internet or phone will be especially helpful in giving them time away from the cult use the vacation to have fun not to press your views onto the person the conclusion that the cult isn t perfect needs to come from the person stay stable and safe 6 x research source provide a predictable friendly environment this helps build trust the easier it is to leave a cult the more likely the person will leave so make your place be easy to access avoid speaking badly about the cult don t use terms like cult brainwashed or mind control this may cause the person to become defensive instead of being open to listening to you 7 x research source instead be polite and inquisitive for example say i can tell you really respect pastor johnson can you tell me more 8 x research source if they ask you to join the cult listen respectfully if they press you to make a decision say that you need more time to make a thoughtful decision discuss their future plans consider your relationship with them and their stage in life when deciding how to talk to them about their desires goals and plans for life beyond their group including educational plans and talents and gifts they may have musical software knitting anything as well as family plans ask what they feel about the limitations of the cult ask them how they feel about the restrictions and limitations of the cult keep your tone indirect and open rather than confrontational 9 x research source how do you feel about the group limiting what you are allowed to wear what do you think about the group only allowing you to date certain people i heard that your leader predicted that the world would end last year i don t know what to think of that what are your thoughts give them room to think for themselves avoid telling the person what to think or forcing your ideas on them even if you are obviously right being heavy handed may drive them deeper into the cult if you ask a question and they don t know how to answer let them sit and think,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to understand and admire cultural differences,differences do set us apart but we often forget that we are all human and our culture is much more representative of our differing environment than truly different people understanding and accepting other cultures is about keeping your mind open and learning and you ll find a little knowledge is all it takes to truly broaden your horizons,seek out experiences foods and people who seem foreign to you in almost every single instance the only thing required to bridge cultural differences is an introduction this isn t always easy but the best thing to do is make an effort go to the international folk music festival eat in a restaurant where english isn t the first language and say hello to the new family down the street local colleges and universities often bring in speakers artists and musicians from across the globe these events are usually free making it an easy way for you to get yourself involved in a multi cultural environment 1 x research source an authentic mexican restaurant will be a better choice than a fast food place that just so happens to sell mexican food such as taco bell single family owned businesses such as grocery stores and restaurants are great places to frequent expand your media diet to include other cultures even broadening your television palate can help admire cultural differences travel documentaries and news from foreign countries even just the bbc will give you a much broader worldview from home check out some music in another language from the library read a book that has been translated and pay attention to world news not just american no one can understand or pay attention to everything follow your interests looking into and enjoying the new cultures and ideas that spark your interest invite other cultures into your home you can accept travelers or sponsor exchange students some people open their homes with apps like air bnb while others might work through a church or charity to help provide for new immigrants and traveling groups even easier you can simply invite people from other cultures over for dinner the best way to understand and admire cultural differences is over food and friendship so extend an olive branch try a cultural potluck where everyone must bring food representative of their culture start a music exchange giving each other the favorites from each culture and then comparing get in touch with your local rotary club to ask about opportunities to host people from other cultures learn a new language language is much more than a simple one to one translation from english to something else it shows how people think exposes nuances in cultures and people and allows you to get much closer to understanding and acceptance of complex cultural ideas some words cannot be translated smoothly such as the senegalese word tauranga and are the best at illustrating the unique culture from which they come remember that even similar people have cultural differences worth learning about you don t have to fly across the ocean to experience different cultures and ideas even families across the street have cultural histories and practices that date back through their roots communities in the same cities even have markedly different cultural backgrounds don t limit yourself to cultures that seem very different try to experience the life of those in the worse and better parts of your hometown get out and see new places pushing your comfort zone as much as possible go somewhere outside of your town state or even your country and experience how other people live first hand as this is the best way to learn about other cultures that said not all travel experiences lend themselves to cultural immersion and some options are better than others volunteer trips frequently stick you right in the middle of the action allowing you to get to know locals which is the best way to immerse yourself into another culture pre planned trips can be very touristy but many of them allow home stays where you get to live with a local family the longer you spend in a town the more of their culture you can begin to appreciate 2 x research source read as much about the local culture as you can before arriving it is irresponsible in many ways to arrive in a new country or state without knowing how things usually run it is also the best way to get immediately shocked upon landing which can make it harder to accept the culture later on read online check some books and generally arrive well informed that said be ready for some shocks or changes in the real world but at least having some knowledge beforehand will help with any culture shock check especially for culturally unacceptable practices in some cultures men and women should never touch in public in some places a thumbs up gesture is considered rude if you want to truly understand a culture you can t accidentally offend it necessary dress and clothing while shorts are acceptable across america they are frowned upon in some places women in particular should pay attention to cultural fashion norms as they may be strict common greetings and phrases even if you don t learn the language simply greetings can do wonders and open doors to all sorts of cultural experiences 3 x research source 4 x research source commit yourself fully to the culture you re in learning by doing the best way to understand and admire cultural differences is to make yourself a part of them help cook meals go to the local watering holes and join the people at the bar and take public transport the longer you give yourself in the culture the more you will learn and grow at the very least make a few friends wherever possible you ll be surprised how much most people want to meet and talk to foreigners don t try to impose your own culture on others or try to replicate your culture while abroad go with the flow becoming a part of the culture instead of trying to stick out of it don t compare their culture to yours as this can easily be seen as an insult the most important thing is to try to understand cultural differences and find a common understanding between each other understand that the first few days of culture shock will pass culture shock or the sudden anxiety and worry about being in a completely new place and culture affects even seasoned travelers the good news it is almost always temporary and the best way to beat it is to push through it it is natural to feel nervous in a new place but keeping yourself moving talking and learning is the best way to show yourself that it is not so bad don t let the first few attempts at understanding deter you the difficulty will pass share parts of your own culture and life to encourage others to share theirs one of the best things to bring while traveling is a set of photos from home allowing you to bring people into your own life and culture from anywhere no matter where you are giving a little bit of yourself is the best way to learn a little bit about others and learning is the key to understanding and ultimately acceptance 5 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source keep in mind that not everyone will want to learn about your culture if someone seems reluctant or disinterested stop don t be pushy about it begin from a perspective of study or research not as a foreigner or outsider the best way to overcome cultural differences is an open inquisitive mind let yourself wonder why something is happening instead of judging it more often than not your initial revulsion or lack of acceptance is the cause of ignorance not some horrible or unthinkable cultural practice try to look objectively instead of comparing what is happening to how you normally do things remember that for someone unsure of your culture your methods likely seem odd or weird too stop thinking about right and wrong as there are very few right ways to do things especially where unique cultural practices are concerned instead think of the why 6 x research source try to understand the context of the differences not just the differences themselves there is a custom in many nordic countries that embraces the cold and dead of winter with gleeful hope instead of the normal practice of loving summer and sheltering up during winter it s strange but it makes sense in context these nations have long cold and dark winters and they ve adjusted their cultural mindset accordingly their differences are the result of the weather not some cultural whim remind yourself that culture is a response and reflection to the environment politics and resources not something that appears out of thin air noting these triggers will help understand them 7 x research source find the purpose or main aim of the cultural practices in question there are very few things that people just do without a reason that reason may be something abstract like spiritual worship or impressing the other sex but that doesn t mean it is coming out of nowhere every cultural practice including the more extreme or difficult ones come from the desire to fix or accomplish something and figuring out what that is will take you a long way towards understanding and admiring it outside research asking questions and careful watching are necessary to get over the immediate shock of certain cultural differences like walking into a senegalese house in the fall and seeing a half skinned goat however knowing the religious importance of tabeski a local holiday makes the behavior a lot more understandable 8 x research source look for the underlying cultural similarities finding the basic human behavior underneath it all the men of the xhosa tribe of africa paints themselves up and dances once a year hoping to score a date from the women looking on it s loud bright and crazy but is it really that different from an american club scene especially when make up high fashion and attempts at dancing are concerned we are more alike than most people realize and the impetus for most of our cultural practices is very similar across cultures even if the manifestation of that impulse is a bit different across the globe 9 x research source know that you don t have to love all practices of a culture to accept people at large people disagree and if you ve done your best to be open minded fill in the gaps in your knowledge and communicate with others it is okay if you still disagree or dislike a practice women still can t drive in saudi arabia a political choice born out of cultural differences between the sexes while you can understand where this decision came from historical sexist practices certain readings of religious texts etc that doesn t mean you have to accept it 10 x research source don t feel like understanding and accepting is the same thing as condoning the behavior your job as a traveler is to be open minded not to agree with everything,Philosophy-and-Religion

churches in the same religion or talk about mass suicide if the church preaches about scary unavoidable prophecies or suicide it is probably a cult 4 x research source usually these prophecies will come from a human leader of the church and are not based on religious text evaluate whether the church requires you to isolate yourself cults use isolation so that they can manipulate you and prevent you from figuring out that the organization is a cult avoid churches who require mandatory isolation or a cutting of ties with family and friends typically cults will draw you in at first and you ll find out about the mandatory isolation later determine if they have an elitist doctrine many cults will have an elitist doctrine that sees themselves as superior to those outside of the cult cults

techniques things like hypnosis group peer pressure and mandatory isolation are common mind control techniques that religious cults use to control their members try to identify times that the church has made these things mandatory and avoid any church that employs these tactics common hypnosis techniques include repetitive music and patterned paced speaking that can put people into a trance question the rules if you ask questions about the group s rules and the church s leaders become defensive or angry it may be a sign that you re in a cult if they want undying loyalty it s a good sign that it may be a cult 8 x research source real churches will have explanations for their rules or can point to some form of scripture or text that explains the rules determine if the church uses intimidation and manipulation a cult will often use threats and fears to keep their membership in line this could come in the form of a calamity sent by god or the threat of isolation from family and friends if the church uses intimidation and fear to get their members to follow the rules it s a sign that the church is a cult 9 x research source beware of churches who require you to perform unwanted favors if the church members or leadership consistently pressure you to do favors for them that are outside of the scope of the church it s a sign that the church is a cult these favors can cut into your time and could include things like picking things up from the store physical labor or financial contributions read common criticism of the church seek out common criticisms of the church by searching news about the church online read opinions and experiences from past and current members of the church it may enlighten you to know how other people view the church and may give you the details that you need to know if it s a cult if a church is a legitimate church it will be able to hold up to criticism 10 x research source if a church prevents you from reading critical literature it s a sign that the church is a cult talk to family and friends outside of the church ask friends and family that aren t members of the church if they think that the church is a cult their opinions will be more unbiased than members of the church and they may be able to give you a better objective view if the church prevents you from talking or interacting with other people outside of the church it s a sign that the church is a cult you can say something like hey do you think this new church i m going to is strange i ve been thinking that it might be a cult what do you think be honest with

how to live as an antinatalist,antinatalism is a philosophy that holds the premise that pain and suffering are bad and that pleasure while good is not needed by those who don t exist new human lives will inevitably contain pain and suffering therefore antinatalism concludes through philosophical reasoning that it is better for human beings not to be born by not being born a potential but as yet unborn person has avoided the suffering of life all of which was preventable if the parents had not procreated and brought that person into existence the philosophy draws in particular on the work of david benatar a lecturer and philosopher at the university of cape town south africa how do those who adopt or advocate this philosophy live here are some philosophical and practical suggestions,do not start any additional lives if you have not yet had children do not have any if you have had children don t have any more do not allow yourself to procreate either deliberately or by accident take complete responsibility for contraception remain celibate or seek an early abortion so that you do not bring another being into existence just as they say to let sleeping dogs lie allow the uncreated to remain in their undifferentiated painless state learn about antinatalism read the book better never to have been the harm of coming into existence by david benatar this book will explain the logic behind the philosophy of antinatalism continue to read other online articles and book reviews about antinatalism consider how your antinatalism will express itself be forewarned that this is a misunderstood and unpopular philosophy calling into question as it does the very meaning of human existence be discreet and consider the potential social familial employment and religious ramifications in your life to whom will you talk about antinatalism how can you explore or discuss the philosophy without having friends and family worry that you re depressed a gradual theoretical approach may help you test the conversational waters such as making a general comment like i recently learned about an interesting philosophy antinatalism which suggests that being born is actually harmful to humans discuss the philosophy with other people once you feel confident and conversant with the antinatalist philosophy as a person who was born yourself stick up for the moral right of those who would not want to be born become informed about various religious perspectives learn what each religion professes about the meaning of life and death pain and pleasure procreation and suicide buddhists may be influenced by the concept of avoiding rebirth christians may be swayed by the idea that their children could end up suffering eternally in hell however keep in mind that many people object to antinatalism on religious grounds and you are unlikely to leverage someone off of a position which is based in faith particularly with a philosophical discussion no matter how logical or rational your arguments consider non human suffering extend your antinatalist philosophy to non human sentient beings and work to minimize their suffering as well treat animals compassionately this may include eating a vegan or vegetarian diet not owning pets or only keeping rescue pets or taking care that animal products you consume are from animals who were treated humanely while alive prevent unnecessary pain once a person is born they are no longer in the category of the never born and thus should not be denied human compassion love and medical intervention when needed you can live a long and productive life as an antinatalist murder and suicide cause pain to victims and survivors and thus should not be indulged if you are depressed or suicidal you may benefit from professional medical or psychological intervention keep in touch with others don t restrict your social life to fellow antinatalists the pool is too small and you won t be able to entice others to dive in and openly consider your philosophy if you are in danger of social isolation consider becoming active with a philosophically non dogmatic religious group such as unitarian universalism or zen buddhism share honestly tell others about your personal experience with life without minimizing problems or overstating pleasures take care of your health get sufficient sleep good nutrition and regular exercise don t invite suffering by ignoring your physical health don t be a downer while the antinatalist philosophy is often considered to be against sentient human life recognition of the misfortune of having been born does not relegate you to dourness suffering complaining or misery antinatalists can be as happy as the next person yet still recognize that everyone s suffering could be obviated if those people had never been born in the first place still once a person has been born they may as well make the best of a bad situation pursue pleasure for yourself and others and avoid contributing to suffering,Philosophy-and-Religion

they re coming from 6 x research source remember that your choice to not believe in god is not being challenged by another person s choice to believe in god use humor to connect with one another and

paraphrase what they just said to show you understand ask questions to move the conversation forward instead of letting it stall out be empathetic and acknowledge the other person s feelings make sure you re both defining god the same way sometimes different people have different definitions of what god actually is before you engage in a conversation with someone who believes in god make sure you re both defining god in the same way ask the person you re talking with to clarify what their god entails before getting into a theological discussion check in at different points in the conversation to make sure you re still on the same page this will prevent you from arguing over one another have a collaborative conversation not a confrontation regardless of how persuasive your argument is the person you re talking with is probably not going to leave the conversation an atheist treat your conversation like a religious exploration and you may both leave having learned something new ask questions that challenge your partner s beliefs but do so because you re interested not because you re trying to trip them up if the other person makes a good point tell them learning about god should

how to explore and study intention,intention is a surprisingly important but rarely explored part of the mind as its significance is only important after the fact only once you ve spent time observing it can you find just how it fits in to day to day living intention is a main stepping stone or foundation of the mind that is important to understand start exploring it today,find out the ways you can best view intention as it happens meditation particularly walking meditation is excellent for this subject but you can find other means such as observation and consideration in day to day activity you can study the mind and mental themes the body and body processes or all of them together if you wish in some cases this is often referred to as mindfulness which is probably the most in depth and practical way to study this subject as it is essentially an awareness of things in the moment as they happen consider and try to identify two main types of intention for lack of better words we could separate them into body functional and emotional psychological types for the purpose of exploring this topic for example you may feel hungry and intend to find a meal which is aimed at meeting a bodily need but the choice as to how to prepare the food is a more emotional or psychological one consider if you are for example hungry and you have a tomato would you have it in a salad in a pasta sauce fried or in a sandwich and so forth once you have decided you would need to prepare it and gather the right tools this means there are new intentions behind your actions in gathering the tools to be able to process the tomato into a meal but the bodily function doesn t really care as a tomato is food be it raw or cooked there are also existing meditation practices devoted to these two types of intention known as body mindfulness and mental mindfulness investigate or try those to see if they help you look at the role intention plays in relation to action intention runs consistently before action and this can be seen such as when you have no intention to do anything at all you can easily just sit and vegetate until you feel the need to do something such as eat go to the toilet bathroom or find something to do if boredom strikes reaction is not really different as it still does have its own mental processes that still come before the response they are just much faster due to the urgency this is often because the mind acts separately without needing any intellectual analysis preferences or commentary such as if when a person senses something approaching their head they typically blink duck or block with their hands etc this too is a body functional intention as mental processes do not all run at the same speed some are much faster than others but the mind has to intend to blink duck or block etc as without the mind being aware and being able to knit the information together to make an instruction to the body how to react a reaction wouldn t happen explore how perception shapes intention perception shapes urgency so if it perceives danger or pain it adds greater importance and urgency to the action likewise if perception informs you not to like something such as feeling bored or hungry perception then influences intention to want to do something about the negative feeling likewise consider other things that can affect intention positively such as insight or negatively such as prejudice similarly how perception can receive a sensation mental or physical then from that feeling make a reaction and how our preferences or personal perception opinions can affect intention positively or negatively should be considered think about how intention affects objects for example a knife can be used in surgery to treat the wounded or in day to day tasks such as cooking or in artistic tasks such as carving but at the same time it can also be applied to harmful acts like killing injuring or threatening people the knife itself is just a lump of metal no more evil or innocent than any other object human beings or natural causes have created in itself it doesn t have a character or conscience before during or after it is used intention in design and manufacture can certainly make it look like it has a character or a power of its own but it s still just metal that might make other things consider why people generally don t notice intention intention happens many thousands of times in thousands of little ways for example when typing words the mind intends to type each letter in order so that it acts very quickly in order to cause the words to be typed accurately by the fingers this example can be expanded knowing where the keys are is important to be able to type each letter so the mind has to intend to move the hands to each letter s space on the keyboard to press it and release it then move on to the next letter all while glancing at the screen occasionally to ensure it is correct and at the same time breathe see smell feel etc this is high speed intention to do each part but the mind does it all on its own test this gradually as each action can be broken down into many smaller actions there is intention behind each one and sometimes many intentions happening very quickly you may intend to move your hand to pick up a glass but you have to keep the moving the arm and hand to pick up the glass intention until you perceive you have touched the glass by sight and or feel then that intention dies away as you don t need it anymore and a new intention to lift the glass to your lips comes into action or you can change direction and intend not to pick it up but then let go of it it s much like a movie the moving picture displayed on the screen happens because light is shown through a strip of thousands of static images all in an order showing their subtle changes this strip is put through a projector and run at high speed high enough to trick the mind to make many still pictures into a flowing moving image the mind simply isn t aware that the moving image on the screen is made of a lot of little images like a day is just a flow of many thousands of little intentions and actions find out how far intention goes in the actions it covers if you don t intend to do something the body can force you to do it by feeling pain exhibiting fear anxiety or distress or feeling hot or cold and so forth however intention is a conscious thing for example you can manipulate the manner in which you breathe and indeed you can intend to stop breathing and simply hold your breath or stop moving the muscles that make the lungs expand and contract likewise you can intend to not use the toilet or bathroom in each case though the body very quickly starts to protest at this and forces you to breathe again or to use the toilet as needed yet at the same time there are certain processes we cannot intentionally change such as our heartbeat digestive processes aging blood processing oxygen absorption through the lung tissue and getting rid of carbon dioxide expelling bodily waste products that soon become toxic through sweating to cool down etc the body needs to do some of these things to stay alive and healthy decide on whether you can influence intention be it emotional or psychological types of intention or bodily function types or intention given that there are many hundreds of intentions there are many that can be changed for the better and for the wiser such as in the case of an intention to be hateful or greedy manic or lazy if you keep observing your intentions until you can see the intention making you think feel or act you can also seek to modify that intention simply by using a conscious intention of a different kind such as intending to let go of a harmful chain of thought continue to evaluate intention try to see if some intentions are stronger than others which may trump another intention such as you may intend to make a phone call but the intention to go to the toilet bathroom is stronger so it trumps the desire to make a phone call sometimes unskillful or harmful intentions such as thinking about a thought that makes you depressed worried or angry

how to explore voidness and live beyond it,voidness is a complex object of study in philosophy because while it is a fundamental system of thought it has been used by many philosophers and metaphysicists on various levels utilizing many different terms to gain a firm understanding of it ideally it should be handled fearlessly by anyone who looks for truth as well as by those seeking to explore humanity and what constitutes the individual in order to discover who and what these concepts constitute here are some ways to explore voidness and to live through it,consider a bold theory for starters namely that voidness or emptiness occurs because it is in between what is there to us what we normally consider as us or me is an accumulated collective of memories knowledge habits culture and beliefs etc but the foundation for all of our consciousness is without a true or pre determined meaning theme or background and remains only an assumption made by our individual brains consider seeing the world for the first time then consider the knowledge and experience that has created all the layers that makes you as a person say this is me and mine yet even as a baby there are countless psychological processes and interactions that result in a you that was there before you were born if you were to take away all these aspects of you anything that remains would be meaningless or inhuman to you if you were to remove all your memories habits and all the things you identify as you you could not consider what is left behind because it is no longer within the realm of mundane human understanding and ideas in essence the identity of a person is dependent on a large variety of internal and external factors each of them impermanent and often acting individually or without our direct awareness and if these individual processes were put aside there is no remainder this philosophy may seem concerning because it requires us to re examine and re evaluate many of the cultural and personal ideas and attachments we have examine other living things just as animals react to similar things that we do such as reacting to hunger or feelings or temperature or to being confronted by an attacker animals can also plan and remember elephants have exceptional memory for places gorillas can learn to communicate using human methods crows recognize human faces and communicate this to other crows predators maintain hunting grounds etc note the similarities between human beings and their animal cousins how connected we are in our daily patterns and motivations and how little difference there is between us all we could pinpoint language as a unique trait but then dogs bark and howl birds twitter and squawk and there is a wide range of animal body language such as baring teeth tensing and puffing up which some animals including humans use to seem bigger and stronger etc words are just like programming code but body language is far more deeply ingrained like firmware to language s software consider that other animals have similar characteristics and functional abilities based in the genetic coding responsible for our hardware consider non living things is there purpose in stones water or even the world probe your own response to this question as underneath your assertions are a great many assumptions about the nature of the world and reality the concept of void ness would remind you that each assumption must be examined and its own arbitrary all together human foundation recognized until nothing remains socrates is possibly best known for the paraphrased quote i am the wisest because only i know that i know nothing there is a hidden meaning to this paradox in that it is not a paradox at all it is not one answer or the other but each reciprocally answering the other never settling on a single answer mastering this is key to understanding the void consider the scale of the universe from its galaxies and stars down to the tiny bacteria atoms and subatomic particles all these things change are impermanent and are independently in motion consider how the planets are racing though space around the sun or other stars if you keep expanding this perspective to take the stars into account and any planets they may have is there evidence or not of some plan or a great mover of those stars and planets as opposed to physics try to consider a weighted average between your experience and the views of others in this regard smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb 5 53 explore voidness and live beyond it step 3bullet2 jpg v4

then letting it go are there any demonstrable patterns that evidence where they are intended to end up voidness by nature puts into stark contrast that many of these design or plan questions may never be resolved because part of the question was without basis in what is actually occurring voidness in practice requires a person to put aside these questions in order to prevent bias or selective observation and that a person without opinion desire or preferences observe that things are simply as they are it might be possible that the universe was purposefully set in motion and left to its own devices much like a spinning top but then it might also be possible for the forces of physics to start it and keep it going without assistance it is a consistent variation between two main philosophies either a one option is that some entity set all of reality in motion or b another option is that physics every particle wave is acting as it must void of plan or controller impermanent changing and dynamic responding to cause and effect and that a true singular beginning is simply not evident but is a result of continuous change each option has demonstrable evidence in the eyes of individual observers however in this instance it is important to be aware when the observation and interpretation of such evidence is selective and or relative therefore a person must observe it as it is without bias or shaping try to find out which approach you consider most apt either by studying the vast universe and physics or life and the terrestrial animals of earth but always looking for a pattern or demonstrable evidence to support your theories einstein proved to his own satisfaction at least that everything came from nothing your own evaluations matter in your search for the truth as well as the views of others but it is wise to not depend on any one view for exploring your mind and the world the buddha who spoke much on the subject described the varying and opposing philosophies of his day many of which are mainstream today as a jungle of views a tangle of views while many tried to juggle and cut their way through them to find the facts for themselves the buddha realised it was necessary to abandon those which did not match what was real even if it was an enchanting or self empowering philosophy if a person was to continue to hold on to a firm set belief or hypothesis during their search for the facts or searching for an answer to a question tied to a belief structure they would not be able to have both philosophy therefore is about the scientific process of observation and analysis in relation to personal experiences and should not be about reaching absolute certainty while the laws of physics can be highly transcendental and enlightening it is the rare minority who go down that path as it is not self empowering nor inclining towards power or debate the concepts of the words absolute certainty are themselves neither absolute nor certain due to the universal nature of impermanence and change as it has been aptly said a little knowledge is a dangerous thing a person intent on researching this subject must not only consider both options to a deep level not a trivial level but at the same time accept that while there is many interpretations of life and the universe there is only this reality which is as it is work out what your feelings are in relation to the idea of void such as whether you find the idea of voidness scary comforting or strange and so forth if you feel anything at all try to find out what and why as well as how it influences your perception of all other things in life look where new emotions point you see if that changes anything you might find that if you feel uncomfortable it might be because you re handling a new idea but that s a good thing allow yourself to be stretched intellectually then ask yourself whether those feelings influence what you believe to be the nature of existence if you find the idea is liberating scary in its implications or want to see if your conclusions can be tested then look outside into the world stay mindful of the ideas you are looking for see if their patterns repeat with any significance in reality see how you can use your thinking and experiences to improve your life and make the world a better place consider in what way you will move beyond the voidness to continue engaging with the world by letting go of socially constructed thoughts and feelings and looking beyond them finally remember above all this in a world void of pre determined meaning you are free to make your own we have no choice about dying at some point but we get to choose how to live it is important to remember that by avoiding making our own path in order to follow another s interpretation or opinions we never develop deeply as human beings and life remains without depth potentially living with information that is all second hand as we have made no discoveries or insights of our own the knowledge gained by exploring voidness is knowing what promotes a happy healthy and peaceful life and what results in stress illness and strife there can be power dignity and honor in thinking for oneself and to co exist in harmony with one s environment good luck and have fun,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to create the thoughts you want,we have all started accepting the fact that thoughts create our world while it is an exciting revelation for some this awareness is making life miserable for others as they are unable to control negative or destructive thoughts and create positive and creative thoughts,be conscious you should be conscious of your thoughts every moment one thought or other will pass through your brain don t try to control them in this phase as that may lead to stress just be conscious pause whenever you become conscious of a negative thought passing through your brain just pause that thought you can even visualize as if there is a pause button somewhere near to your right ear and just press that button and pause the thought replay replay that thought in your mind suppose the thought was i don t think i will win this contract just replay that thought again in your brain here also you can visualize a play button next to the pause button ask while the thought is paused ask yourself is this what i want you will get an answer from your brain no explore ask yourself what is it that i want then the brain will say in fact i want the contract to be won reframe reframe the need statement in the present tense as mind operates in the present you can reframe this as i am winning the contract come what may play now you press the play button and hear the sound i am winning the contract come what may replay this statement again and again and again while you are driving to the client s office to sign that contract let this statement be played continuously in your brain,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to defend evolutionism against creationism,the theory of evolution has been around since the 1800s and is widely accepted around the world evolution by natural selection is one of the best substantiated theories in the history of science supported by evidence from a wide variety of scientific disciplines including paleontology geology genetics and developmental biology still there are many people who hold religious explanations for the origins and growth of life some take a literal reading of scripture called young earth creationists while others use more complex pseudo science intelligent design if you find yourself in a debate be sure to anticipate these groups claims try to reconcile religious arguments while defending the science behind evolution,separate faith and science science tries to understand the natural world and how it works think of it as a method of inquiry one that measures and gathers evidence in support of or against hypotheses but science as it stands has no way to determine whether or not a deity exists it can t make a judgment on the issue 1 x research source make this key distinction or you ll get nowhere point out that evolution tries to explain the growth of life on earth it has nothing to say about the origins of life or the universe arguments like something can t come from nothing aren t relevant to the question at hand the central idea of biological evolution is that all life on earth shares a common ancestor just as you and your cousins share a common grandmother through the process of descent with modification the common ancestor of life on earth gave rise to the fantastic diversity that we see documented in the fossil record and around us today evolution means that we re all distant cousins humans and oak trees hummingbirds and whales accept and ask the other person to accept that one of you is talking about science which is supported by empirical evidence while the other is talking about faith and non science acknowledge evolution s limits both creationism and evolution are worldviews they proceed from a certain account of the world s origins and assume the world conforms to this account in other words the conclusion is already held to be true recognize that this worldview limits you just as your friend s worldview limits her 2 x research source be able to admit that you can t disprove the existence of deities or with evolutionary theory just as your friend can t disprove evolution with arguments from faith however you can debunk falsifiable hypotheses including creation myths and if there was valid evidence against the theory of evolution it would be accepted by the scientific community no one really knows the origins of the universe or where we came from make a goodwill effort to see things from the creationist point of view don t be afraid to admit that science cannot explain everything about the origin of life at the same time what we don t know now may well be discovered in the future point to other creation myths point out that most religious traditions have creation myths the judeo christian story from the bible is not unique but has parallels in babylonian texts like the enuma elish i e in the beginning there was only undifferentiated water swirling in chaos many other religious traditions have their own stories as well 3 x research source the ancient persians believed that the universe was created in a six or seven part series first the sky then water the earth plants and animals and humans fire was the last creation the ancient greeks told the story of gaia the earth who gave birth to the heavens mountains and sea she later gave birth to the world ocean and other primordial races 4 x research source the yoruba people say that before the earth the god olorun lived with divine entities called orisha around a great baobab tree in the sky accept that evolution and god do not have to be contradictory people like to argue that science and religion or faith and reason are mutually exclusive this is not so the fact is that science is agnostic about god it has nothing to say about a divine creator this means that it is possible to believe in evolution and in a divinely created universe many religious people reject naturalistic evolution because they think it denies god s role in the universe especially in creation and providence i e the idea that god actively intervenes on earth evolution may contradict a literal reading of the bible but people have read the bible in other ways for centuries and many christians accept the story as a myth or allegory not the literal truth point out that religious figures like pope francis believe in evolution and say that evolution is not only compatible with a creator but requires it 5 x research source familiarize yourself with creationist claims and how to refute them young earth creationists raise some common objections which are fairly easy to handle be ready for these and offer honest straightforward answers 6 x research source some objections are philosophical or ethical i e evolution is atheistic or immoral evolution means life has no meaning natural selection is might equals right or even evolution itself is a religion don t feel the need to reply to these claims as said above they are moral rather than scientific issues more sophisticated creationists will try to undercut the science or scientific consensus behind evolution i e evolution is only a theory evolution hasn t been proved there are gaps in the fossil record mutations are harmful or evolution violates the second law of thermodynamics urge your friend to understand the philosophy of science try to make sure he can explain the scientific method and what theory means science builds its theories to fit observed facts it is theoretical and open to revision as fact dictates this does not mean that it s unsupported by evidence 7 x research source dispel misconceptions about the word theory a theory is an idea that is supported by evidence whereas a hypothesis is a proposition to be tested while theories like evolution plate tectonics and relativity are open to revision they are supported by vast amounts of evidence 8 x research source a good scientist will reject or revise evolutionary theory based on the facts that are presented in fact evolutionary theory has been revised many times and will continue to be tweaked in the future if you must explain that revision is not a weakness but an example of the scientific process at work scientists take almost nothing for granted and are ready to change their minds when new information is discovered impress that there is in fact near total consensus in the scientific community evolution is accepted by 99 of biologists 9 x research source reiterate that evolution is sound science some creationists claim that the theory of evolution is not sound for two reasons it is not testable or falsifiable it makes claims about things that were not actually observed and cannot be recreated be patient and make your case 10 x research source this claim does not account for the difference between micro and macro evolutionary theory i e changes in species over time and changes in groups above the level of species scientists have plenty of observed evidence for evolution on the micro level with studies of fruit flies cells and darwin s study of galapagos island finches for example on the macro level it is true that we can t test past conditions but we can study physical evidence like the fossil record and make informed inferences we would expect humans to have evolved from a series of earlier hominids for example and this what fossils show we do not find hominids in dinosaur era strata the idea that evolution can t be falsified isn t true it could easily be falsified if we found evidence for say a static fossil record or the spontaneous generation of a species rebut other claims calmly and rationally young earth creationists have a whole supply of pseudo scientific arguments be prepared for false claims having to do with mutation fossils genetics and entropy reply patiently but realize that you may never actually convince your friend 11 x research source 12 x research source challenge doubts about natural selection do children look like their parents do they inherit traits genetically and can we notice any trends over time for example people s feet are bigger today than they were 200 years ago what about animals animals and people inherit different colored skin hair fur and dimensions from their ancestors these differences can be advantageous for example a giraffe with a longer neck can eat more leaves be healthier live longer and reproduce more some creationists will points out gaps in the fossil record where are the transitional species we should see with evolution in fact there are many transitional fossils point to archeopteryx still a dinosaur but with light bones and feathers most people know that it has birdlike features so point out that it has many more that are fully reptilian 13 x research source some also say natural selection can t explain different species but animals move to different places with different conditions a good example is the darwin finches which had the same origin but evolved on different islands they have different beaks and are biologically distinct species one thorny claim is about entropy the idea that systems tends toward disorder how can we account for complex life in an entropic universe this is actually a misunderstanding the second law of thermodynamics only says that the whole entropy of a system can t decrease local complexity does not contradict the law otherwise things like mineral crystals and snowflakes would be impossible 14 x research source note that intelligent design id is not science recently many deniers have attacked evolution with a pseudo scientific theory called intelligent design this is the idea that the physical and biological systems in the universe must come from the purposeful design of a creator it s more complex than young earth creationism but it s no more scientific 15 x research source in a nutshell id states that the universe is really complex and has things that are well suited to their observed function think the human eye this functionality and complexity can t be chance it states it must be the work of a designer i e god many supporters of id also accept microevolution i e the idea of development in existing species sound good not so fast scientific theory has to have evidence that excludes all other possibilities it also needs to make predictions that can be tested and confirmed or denied the problem is that id can t be empirically tested it also doesn t exclude other explanations biologists have shown that complex things like blood clotting for example could have developed from earlier simpler systems 16 x research source id fails to predict new things as well this is something scientific concepts should do undercut claims about complexity and function id doesn t deny that life forms in the universe can progress from simple to more complex states but it quibbles its supporters argue that the fact of evolution could not have occurred only through natural processes they point to the complexity and patterns we see in nature and also to how animals are well adapted to environments 17 x research source as said evolution is an alternative explanation for complexity id can t disprove this and it has no way of testing its own claims id also claims that functionality proves the hand of a creator that a creator designed animals to be well adapted however evolution also explains function be sure to point this out functionality does not have to come from design in fact scientists argue that evolution is blind species that survive are not perfectly adapted but good enough and live long enough to reproduce use the example of dinosaurs why would a designer have to create so many species that went extinct what was the purpose of these animals deal with the argument from chance supporters of id like to argue that the evolution of complex forms is improbable it is unbelievable that life could arise all by itself because the odds are so small what are the chances of a working car emerging from a junkyard tornado slim to none therefore they point to an intelligent plan this argument is also not very good 18 x research source the junkyard tornado is not a sound analogy with life supporters of id ignore the fact that there are laws of interaction in the universe natural forces acting between particles and other considerations point out that the odds are not stacked against the natural origin of life abiogenesis the probability of the simplest building block forming is about 1 in 10 to the 40th power this is a huge number but billions of trials would happened at every moment on primordial earth 19 x research source cite the infinite monkey theorem say a monkey or group of monkeys are randomly mashing keyboards the odds that they will type something comprehensible are near zero at any one moment but if with enough time or enough monkeys the long term odds are near certain the odds for abiogenesis are similar attack id s central logical problem id is based on a key flaw the idea of a designer or that design requires a designer this is a logical fallacy one you should point out to your friend 20 x research source poke holes in the assumptions id relates complexity and pattern with intelligence for one thing we look at things around us chairs cars computers and assume they have a designer shouldn t we suppose other complex things in the universe need a designer actually no this is a fallacy of incredulity you assume something did not happen because you can t understand how it could happen point out slippery definitions too id confuses the meaning of the word design design can mean 1 a structure or pattern that is functional stable or seen as beautiful or 2 the act of purposefully making such a structure note that design in the first sense can in fact arise accidentally or randomly,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to heal spiritually,in today s society spirituality has taken a backseat to the many other priorities thrown at us in a spiritually malnourished society we ve lost our connection to that which makes us human we find ourselves chasing down other s dreams or constructs of what they believe our lives should be in the end we find an empty void that we ve so desperately tried to fill with meaningless things if you re reading this article then congratulations you ve already put yourself on the right path here you will find that you never needed to fill any void in your life because when you are connected to your true spirit you ll see there is no such thing as a deficit we are right where we re supposed to be doing exactly that which will best help us grow if your question is how can i heal spiritually know that you ve already begun,love yourself this is always the first step to connecting with your spirit if you ve been bashing yourself for living the wrong life or mulling over the past now is the right moment to stop that know that when you say negative messages to yourself you are diminishing your own spirit taking you further away from where you want to be a great exercise to try is to observe your thoughts for one day without labelling them either good or bad and instead just watching them this will help you love yourself more and bring healing to your spirit observe your mind this step is a continuation of the exercise from the first step when you can eliminate judgement from your mental space you ll see the thoughts you have with more clarity for many people out there we ve been told what spirituality is in religious terms meaning that you must follow a certain set of rules its possible when you no longer judge your thoughts as right or wrong that you ll shed unnecessary concepts or beliefs no longer helping you at this stage some people see beyond emotional reactions and gain understanding the triggers that cause emotive reactions be patient healing doesn t happen in a day especially for spiritual healing you may work on your spirit for a decade and find one day that you ve fallen into an old belief that you d thought to be long gone there s no benefit in further beating yourself up just be patient this is life so allow it to happen if you re working to stand up for yourself with healthy boundaries and find that you fumble don t worry the lesson will reappear again for you to retry patience will be one of your greatest allies when healing because we often have to repeat lessons a few times before getting them right understand what spirituality is for you as mentioned earlier the majority of us grew up under the notion that spirituality happens in a temple under a strict code of rules and regulations if this environment makes you feel uncomfortable then this is likely a place that will stifle your spirit various metaphysical healers and philosophers have often pointed to spirituality being an awakening process what this means is that we already know what areas light up our spirits it s just a matter of awakening to them for some people when they get on a stage in front of others and sing their heart out they feel that bright connection to their spirit for others when they work on a mechanical project they feel connected to something bigger in that moment as you heal you ll feel your spirit and be able to more accurately hone into it have fun healing can often elicit images of depressing hospital rooms and the like this does not have to be your healing process laughter will heal your bones faster than sitting in a situation you find to be depressing go to an amusement park join a drum circle get a dog take that dog to the park and the list goes on sunshine will blow away old cobwebs around your spirit if you spend some time in its warmth remember that healing is a process of making you stronger which will allow you to laugh and cry more often feel your emotions allow those emotions to come out of their suppressed cases if you hear a story that touches your heart don t hold back the tears if they re coming this is your spirit talking physically as a society we ve learned that certain emotions are okay and that others aren t yet this is a false notion your emotions play an integral part to your life s journey don t bind them to ideas brewed from misinformation if you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation then validate that emotional response don t beat it up for happening as you heal you ll find yourself becoming more comfortable expressing your true feelings rather than what you believe others want give back your spirits lift to new heights when you give to others because you know that you re using your gifts to their fullest potential when you give you ll find that you get more in return when you help others heal you ll find yourself healing in the process giving back doesn t mean you have to volunteer somewhere destitute or to even leave your house because it s different for everyone some people love writing inspirational blog others enjoy cooking meals for their loved ones and so it goes give back what you love doing because you ll bring a wonderful spirit to others and yourself,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to explore words and live beyond them,there are times it seems we live off of live with and cannot seem to live without words language is slightly different to words although certainly connected language is used as a term to group a collection of words as well used as a way to identify other communities of people but words are surprisingly one of those things that can only take you so far and actually hinder both expression creativity our ability to connect with other people and understanding the greater dynamic of the mind to be able to pave a way for better well being deeper insight can occur without words this article focuses on not only how you can explore how words work but also live beyond them,determine when and where words are used as a basic starter words are often used primarily to identify or label things and then to describe and communicate these things both to ourselves and other people yet the word is not the thing the use of words is about being able to share an idea or feeling of the thing with others the words linking us with the object existing in the world and the concept in our mind but there are many other uses for words such as sharing an abstract idea with others like globalization or to explain our relationship to people or objects in a code form to be able to talk about subjects secretively and many others so try to explore those uses too consider also what makes you want to break out into words the immediate point of exploring the usage of words is that words don t need to be used all the time we might say it s a tomato but the word tomato is not actually the thing it s just a label and indeed many languages have different labels we give and gain emotions with words in many cases such as the word love but love is far more than words as are all the other feelings and ideas sometimes the use of words may be used to modify other feelings we may vent our anger by expressing with words and the amount of intention or stress of those words while studies have shown that we can tolerate pain longer by using very strong words the frequency or selection of words often can be chosen by neural pathways if we use a word a lot it is virtually a mental habit but there are cases where we get an emotional or biological response by selecting words sometimes the use of words can confuse and obfuscate the point being made because we have differing perceptions dependent on the words used consider for example cross cultural exchanges of words with speakers who have many words for rain the celtic irish many words for water the hopi or many words for cooking the same food item the japanese there are also many languages where words may have a gender of its own or to be used only by certain genders changing subtly or largely for the opposite sex in these cases the words used can give rise to very different perceptions dependent on the speaker s and listener s viewpoint words have allowed these cultures to be far more specific and descriptive on one level but at the same time can prevent communication more broadly test to see how you react to words we also instill words with emotions but frequently the word can act as a prompt in the brain to generate the same feeling and vice versa the mind reacts first which prompts a common word to express that feeling many words create an instant feeling such as violent or cozy or delicious words actually prompt the mind to feel something in our body sometimes the misuse pronunciation incorrect spelling in writing or grammar of words may affect people to quite a high extent a simple example was if you read the article was about how to do something but a tiny change to the article was about who to do something it suddenly makes no sense and is confusing or the article was about how to do something now can have a hugely different meaning simply with one letter out of place or changed about the article was something how to do strictly speaking has no changes at all except their order consequently words can make a subtle effect when the words aren t quite the same and can make a further effect if they are in bold italics or underlined try this simple test to see how the mind reacts to word groups examine some of the following word groups and see if they create any feelings or thoughts in you 1 different weird foreign 2 famous fashionable exclusive 3 yellow simple weather what do you feel about these words now add another word of your own choosing to those groups did that change the associated feeling or did you pick another word that meant the same so the feeling stayed the same the third group it is likely you would have felt confused and thought about a connection word to try to combine the others to make sense did the various feelings just happen on their own or did the words prompt the mind to make those feelings if you found that they had no effect on you at all try thinking about words that scare you or that make you want something write them down and consider why those words made you feel anything they are just bunches of letters and sounds after all so what is it that makes you react to them a similar application example is that a person might label another person by their culture age gender lifestyle belief system etc and become uncomfortable about them if not outright hostile they might be perfectly ordinary and friendly people that in circumstances where no words have been spoken one would be fine with this person but suddenly that label causes an uncomfortable feeling to arise and words become objects and consequently identifiers of prejudice and bias the word itself has become an expression and a symbol of ill will and there can be further dislike and distrust complications occasionally due to mis interpreted words it also works in the reverse labels can make a person seem more attractive and interesting and we can feel a sense of desire or respect towards those who certain labels are attributed to consider that we can be controlled or manipulated by words there is even a proper term known as neuro linguistic programming nlp which can sometimes be very effective with both positive and harmful results an example is we often are taught at an early age to avoid placing certain things in our mouths as they may be poisonous or a choke hazard which is a positive example but it might affect us later so after being told for example to avoid red berries when confronted with a tray of strawberries and red currants that we are likely to feel doubt as to if they are safe to eat many background examples come from our family friends etc and often by external advertisers this programming when we are young prompts us to act when older it is used very often in politics with negative campaigning to try to prevent the opponent being elected by focusing on their faults to prompt fear or loathing in the public likewise in a debate it is considered essential to not only convince people effectively with words but important strategically to move them towards the key point the debater wishes to make it s important to consider that its not always the events or things that worry us or cause us problems but our mental opinions of them words again that cause us more stress some words in the mind make us feel angry and can be used by others deliberately or unconsciously to inflame or frustrate us make us sad confused or ashamed where if we had the choice they wouldn t be happening some people may live in fear of words or being branded with them such as the words failure dumb useless etc look for obsessions with certain words that you might have there are schools of thought philosophy and political ideology that are obsessed or addicted with specific words which can be a hindrance to communication and looking beyond the scope to see what s really happening words are used to classify things or to lend identity status and belonging but this has its disadvantages it ultimately is important to explore how we can be manipulated by words but not just by others but positively by our own minds the mind uses words or phrases repeatedly to reinforce an assumption or belief often what happens is after a long time we accept it as true without ever considering if it may not be therefore it is important to see why it needs to reinforce something for if the assumption was true then it would be evident very often the mind is misleading us or we are misleading ourselves because we want to believe something look at the levels words take some are functional words such as kitchen pencil walking and so forth which don t create much resonance with you but some very selective words can provoke feeling there are many areas that focus on taking advantage of your responses to words mostly found in marketing words are often more effective when used in rhymes or associated mnemonics that can aid memory try to spot words or the way words are structured and selected to prompt you to feel or act a certain way advertising and public relations for example tend to have very high levels of research to select words effectively it may be a rhyme or jingle or a catchphrase as well as the speaker s accent tone and speed that will entice you most to want to buy their product remember their firm when you need equipment service or repairs or even to elect their politician what is it about these words and how they are used that makes you want to buy or alternatively annoy spur you enough into doing something words ultimately are used by us as individuals as a support foundation or component part of our identity that we use to reinforce our opinion of ourselves a young teenager wouldn t want to be seen using words used by older people or used by more intellectual people who aren t cool another key word that is very important to people the problem is when we become attached to words or certain words and forget that while the word is not the thing words as symbols and tools effectively can use abuse and control us because we value them and their meaning too highly consider how words help you and can be not only useful but beautiful the goal here is not to destroy words utterly there is beautiful poetry and knowledge also expressed in words which we would be at a loss without it is currently considered more or less impossible in dealing with everyday life to be without words and language is an amazing if imperfect thing but words are something that we make in order to describe identify or express what we see feel smell and so on endeavor to find out why words are such useful tools particularly in the context of your daily life it is wise to consider in an educational context that words in a lesson or the key message of a lesson only sinks in when it is relevant to a person often to get a major insight or moment when the penny drops and everything makes sense is when the right words are used at the right time and in the right order often a teacher may be pressing an important life message or a trainer teaching a new employee safety techniques but it never sinks in when the listener or reader is not paying attention because the subject is not relevant or interesting at the time to be relevant words can be very effective when used wisely for impact by considering how to make the lesson strike relevance in the individual the goal for educators is therefore to measure against their own experiences to find out what makes the subject interesting to themselves but also to see what does the student actually want and need when the teacher understands themselves better they improve their ability to instruct a student better and by using words far more effectively be a better educator explore the mental world of words ask yourself when you are having a long thought chain am i making or using these words are there cases where words happen randomly or in a pattern on their own the answer is quite surprising if you examine your thoughts for long enough because words may be used as a pacifier a distraction or a way to keep you engaged over a subject even if it causes you to feel stressed likewise the big question can i understand things without words a big part of maturing or developing is consciously thinking without using the labels we are comfortable with or uncomfortable with try to explore the world without words can you understand something just by seeing or hearing it experiencing without mentally describing or having a running mental commentary experiment with this when feeling an emotion or seeing a scene try not to describe it but just let the emotion be and explore it but explore it without words while a person may say observe it in its pure form the very word pure is another keyword that will affect that way you perceive things so likewise should be put aside for this experiment use your other senses and see what effect they make when a word inevitably comes to mind take a moment and replace it with an expanded understanding and note where the word might have failed you this can be particularly effective with generalities like bad good etc also try physical feelings just let them be and see what is happening if words aren t helpful then let them go in the same way that you would let go of a heavy bag you might find that without the words you might feel and see things more clearly which helps to lead to a far richer understanding language is constantly changing and developing when this becomes apparent you can see that actually life and the world has always operated pretty well without words look at everything again for the first time without using words see how much more you can explore life without them everything becomes new again every image will be subtly different every sound is different and so on because you are able to expand your mind and gain more from the experience you can see more of the finer details and how much of the vast world we live in that we miss on a daily basis you can reduce the amount of words you use when it is to your advantage and see beyond them,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to explore and understand desire,for better or worse desires drive nearly every aspect of our lives and compose nearly everything that defines us as unique individuals however as with all useful tools there is a right way and a wrong way to handle our desires as they can be the source of virtually limitless happiness or unhappiness this article explores desire and offers suggestions on how you can improve your own happiness and well being,first find a place in which you can observe and explore your desires this is important as merely reading about the subject doesn t have as beneficial an effect as watching them as they unfold and analyzing their effects you may practice mindfulness or meditation or simply put your feet up and relax while watching the mind like an explorer set yourself clear guidelines for what you will be doing it s important not to get to involved with the desire or dream just watch them remotely like you would observe a painting in an art gallery you can admire them and encounter many different things but you know you are still in the gallery and not within the painting itself explore the extent of the desire generally it s best to explore it in the moment but also in relation to time this exploration is a fascinating life long journey as it will continue to reveal new facets and variations as you go the purpose of exploring it is to ultimately gain an understanding of it remember that you can let go of the desire don t let it control you desires can be so strong that they can become self destructive as well as detrimental to others around you they not only lead but drive every facet of our life the relationship to time is also important as ultimately the desires that control us the most are born of past experiences if you have a history of stressful experiences you may want to control your present situation to create a positive outcome or prevent a certain negative outcome we often reach out to third parties in order to help us do this much of our mental wishes to power symbols and third parties exist not out of piety but out of desire to create change or prevent loss explore some of the biological impacts of desire generally desire creates a tension in the brain and the body which can be mild or intense in relation to our interaction with the desire this in a nutshell reflects tension and stress headaches as well as nausea and the other symptoms we typically experience when we feel stressed including unhappiness and that common feeling described as blocked where it is difficult to focus on other things excessive desires overwork the brain as it keeps on thinking and craving which leads to mental fatigue this can cause unhappiness as we have less energy and more stress related illnesses many desires are very subtle and often influenced by feelings of dissatisfaction and insecurity for example you might dream of winning the lottery in other cases we may desire to control others or situations as a way to prevent personal frustration re occurring ultimately all our thoughts fantasies and mental chatter are generated by our desires our emotions are likewise tied to desire we get angry and frustrated and despair because our desires weren t realized explore the motivation of each desire generally desires arise from positive emotions such as generosity kindness intelligence compassion and so on or negative emotions such as insecurity or neediness fear anger frustration envy ill will greed ignorance etc the mind produces desires like the liver produces bile it is an exercise in futility trying to stop them simply because that is itself a desire often we become afraid of desires or try to control their expression which only causes more stress to the mind and body it s easy to fall into a groove in how we interact with our desires but this can lead to depression and other problems consider the practical reasons for desires without desire would we see the need to eat sleep exercise be good people work to pay for our meals home and hobbies or even on a very subtle level breathe even your ability to watch tv relax read listen to music sing etc is a fruit of desire our entire life is basically the expression and reflection of our desires desires can ultimately be divided into long term and short term so a spur of the moment desire to go buy something while shopping as well as reactionary desires are primarily short term but may also be connected to long term desires long term desires are more lifestyle orientated such as getting a university education they can also be categorized into functional or intellectual and beneficial or harmful since the mind and body would greatly prefer to relax and do nothing our biological survival depends on actions many of our emotions exist for survival such as fear existing to make us aware of precipices wild animals poisonous things and other dangers greed for possessions such as extra clothing and shelter from cold weather or extreme heat are inherently connected to our survival this body in essence is an investment of much energy and resources the most efficient piece of software in the hardware of the body is the concept of i if we had no concept of self importance then we would not be inclined to protect and feed the body that we depend on likewise in a society where the idea of ego is muted this applies both to primitive tribal communities as well as more modern societies relationships between other people are more important because our survival and well being is linked to cooperation whenever confronted by a choice it is desire that resolves it using knowledge be it accurate or inaccurate as a guide without a desire to make the choice and deal with it s consequences it would remain an unresolved conflict on the other hand we often try to avoid making a choice as the outcome would conflict with our existing choices and desires the body can and often does overrule our mental desires for example if we want to party all night we will feel very tired and if we don t stop to eat we will feel increasingly hungry and uncomfortable this poses a classic paradox to philosophy and ideologies as in some cases the individual is praised and philosophies aim on developing the individual to realise their inner goodness and virtue the alternative view is that the individual is selfish and it is through an enlightened society or all beings being equally dependent on each other as a means to change the individual to be a more noble being both in essence are correct and incorrect at the same time because human beings have both greed and generosity love and hate so all humans have both noble and corrupt virtues consider how desires can be used for benefit ultimately the lesson is always to be smart about your desires we can desire to be good people and do grand things but without skills in dealing with our desires we might not attain our goals the key to building personal happiness is learning to recognize when your desires have gone too far as well as knowing how to let go of them sometimes the old metaphors are the best ones ancient philosophy tells us to rise above our troubles like the lotus rises above the mud that it grows in to do this a person has to desire to act for their own mental wellbeing but it can be difficult to prioritize this over other competing desires it s largely a question of balance one desire is stronger than the other so our will power is not 100 through repeated observation and analysis of our desires and addictions an extreme effect of desire we can attain a healthier more balanced frame of mind,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to describe taoism,taoism is an ancient chinese religion and philosophy based on the teachings in the tao te ching by lao tzu taoism is often difficult to describe to people who have never heard of it as the tao te ching is extremely vague in what it is trying to say it would be helpful to consider how a true spiritual master goes about his or her life to help you get a feel for what is required from a discipline and concentration point of view read the steps section for some real life examples of spiritual greatness,consider this a good spiritual practitioner does not worry too much about the aesthetics of his her house floor boards carpeting marble bench tops smeg appliances such things are irrelevant when it comes to ego loss and becoming one with the void a garden however is something that even the most ascetic of students can not do without for a pretty flower belongs to no one it can neither be owned nor possessed yet a well thought out garden can help the mind to settle and focus on the almighty in a way that not even a ferrari is capable of one cannot describe something one doesn t know or you only have vague knowledge about therefore begin by discovering more about taoism learn both forms of taoism the philosophy of tao and the religion of tao start point the philosophy of tao came first and is based on lao tzu s teachings in the tao te ching next came the religion of tao which is based on the legend that lao tzu visited a hermit and told him the world was going to end those who followed lao tzu would go on to better lives first the philosophy of tao research the main tenets of taoism they are like the ten commandments being a set of moral laws or maxims that say how a man should act starting point the main tenets are do not murder do not steal do not lie do not consume intoxicants or become involved in sexual misconduct this requires a certain discipline an example of such dedication is in how a good spiritual practitioner if stabbed in the thorax will calmly remove the knife clean it and then try to return it to its proper owner read the tao te ching and zhuangzi as these are the two works that make up philosophical taoism read a verse write it down and then try to translate it into simpler language without destroying the original meaning for example tao called tao is not tao tao means way meaning the true way is humble and subtle so few see it those who boast they know the way do not know the way the sage follows a path he does not call it way but it is research the main concepts of taoism that apply to both tao philosophy and tao religion understand that taoist concepts are often paradoxes which are almost impossible to understand tao or the way or path wu wei or action without action te or usually translated as integrity and the cultivating of the tao pu or the state of free from prejudice susceptible to change like tabula rasa when it comes to the religion of tao you must learn the pantheon of deities that make up taoism you should also learn how these are worshipped and why all the deities have different powers worshipped in different ways now once you ve done all your research find a quiet spot away from distractions get a dictionary a thesaurus a notepad and a pencil meditate and while meditating think about what taoism means or means to you with intense meditation you ll spark of your brain write down what you think and you will have unlocked what taoism which is supposedly following the natural means,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to know good from evil,ever wondered about how people can be good or evil we all have good and evil within each of us yet some will have greater evil than good follow this and look at people observations are key,realize that good and evil are points of view and while your own opinion matters there are some universals think of a country where people were admired for running away in battle or where a man felt proud of double crossing all the people who had been kindest to him you might as well imagine a country in where two and two made five c s lewis recognize both points of view there are subjectivists who believe that each person can determine good and evil for himself there are objectivists who believe in a universal concept of good and evil good and evil can be discussed independent of religion so both the religious and the atheistic can be found in both viewpoints which do you identify with why do your homework uncounted philosophers and religionists have taught and debated good and evil right and wrong and other topics read up on the topic see what others have said and decide whether you agree or disagree think about how you or your culture views right and wrong in general evil people do wrong things and good people do right things christianity for example puts emphasis on treating others the way you would have them treat you but remember that each culture to an extent holds different opinions on what is right and wrong write your views on good and bad down then analyze them rethink what truly is right and wrong then when you re satisfied with your list define how many wrong actions it takes or the severity of the action to be declared evil discuss your ideas on morality with others discussing with others may change what you believe to be right and wrong observe others and yourself you would be surprised at the number of people that do wrong things everyday think about if wrong things can really be wrong if everyone does them decide whether you want to be good or evil then do the things you wrote on your list that fits that category,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to explore the difference between knowledge and understanding,perhaps the secret ingredient of all wisdom is understanding that near magical insight where not only the concept but its practical application make perfect sense the complication however is that understanding and knowledge aren t always the same thing so while a person may diligently study a philosophy it might never create much benefit on a deep level or ever make sense so the lesson remains deep abstract and inaccessible this common problem afflicts many and is a major obstacle towards being able to develop skills in life this tutorial explores the differences between the two and how to ensure you get maximum benefit from various religious and philosophical teachings and to reach a greater depth of understanding in your field of study,start at the beginning and look at what knowledge is knowledge in effect is the accumulation of facts myths trivia and beliefs its an all encompassing field of data that we use to live by from methods to complete a task data to be able to plan as well as the ability to reflect on what was learnt reflect on how you accumulated this great store of data data can be accumulated from schools and other people and the mind stores this if it has interest in it be it trivial interest or functional relevance consider how much of your knowledge you actually understand on a deep level by and large the amount of knowledge we have is far greater than the amount of it we really understand for example we may all know that placing a raw egg into boiling water will cook the egg but we don t necessarily understand the process that affects the proteins in the egg however a specialist who studies the process will not only learn how but understand why in the same way we may know many pieces of wisdom but much of it we simply store as learnt but not as understood as we seldom observe it or apply it in a mindful manner explore the relationship with knowledge and the present moment knowledge when closely observed reveals itself to be entirely linked to the past but not the present moment all our knowledge and information has been accumulated over a long period of time the present moment simply is there is just awareness and being it is important to consider this aspect there is very little data knowledge we didn t come across through education experiences and from personal study but this retention of data is simply the retention of data that is not obtained now but was obtained then and is now stored for our personal use in our minds test what happens when you release the past you may try this as a thought experiment or during a meditation exercise if you do let go sufficiently to be fully aware of the present moment its likely only to be for a few minutes as the process of the mind depends on knowledge so it quickly reverts to the process it is familiar with using consider now the relationship you have with your philosophy or religion how much of it is knowledge learned as opposed to knowledge understood it is a very surprising point to understand that many of the methods to live well and be happy have already been discovered by the multitude of philosophers saints and religious leaders over time so why is it that we may hear the answer but it still not make any difference yet for some it does start to explore individual facets of the philosophy by contemplating its intention as well as its method of application as well as its alternatives and its non application you can get a deeper insight its still not sufficient at this stage but this is the foundation to building understanding the greater deal of understanding happens when the knowledge learned is applied directly in the moment the fascinating part of the mind is that it can see the same thing and still learn something new just like when you look at a photograph or a painting many times eventually more and more of it becomes apparent to you you see more subtle effects of light and shadow the brush strokes and paint textures and colours and more subtle parts of the background which can give new meaning and interest with this in mind you can explore the philosophy or teaching or more generally life and the mind itself to be able to comprehend it and find deeper applications and benefits consider the benefits and possibilities of improving your understanding in essence understanding is a very deep process with great benefits whereas simple book knowledge rote learning or mnemonic style information occupies a very shallow level of the mind and so gives minimal benefits it is only when a person has learned it well enough to apply it in the moment can understanding then grow from knowledge finish the process by reflecting again on the difference between knowledge and understanding knowledge ultimately being the collection of past events and second hand knowledge obtained elsewhere in the present moment there is simply understanding and the opening towards serenity and happiness,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to understand the present,a way of understanding where we are in the world today is by finding out how we got where we are history and where we may be going in the future what we understand as the present is an ever changing condition,learn about the world wars and how they shaped the world as it emerged from them finding out how different countries and individuals reacted to the same problem can give you a very good idea as to what was socially acceptable and what was not find out about people s reactions to laws or legislation often similar edicts are being passed today and people may not react as they did in the past learn about the latest technology and how it came into the mainstream this can show you how quickly science can change and the impact of scientific advancement on society computers personal computers have given common people more resources for managing businesses designing complicated plans and storing information that was impossible to do with pen and paper just a few short decades ago the internet this one development has changed how we view learn about and interact with the world on a scale that couldn t be imagined before its acceptance broadcast media satellite television makes viewing global events as well as a vast spectrum of entertainment a daily reality for people almost everywhere communications email has displaced verbal communications in many instances but if you choose to communicate verbally cell phones allow you to do so even when you are driving down the highway or working at your job medicine major breakthroughs in transplants artificial organs molecular biochemistry surgery and other realms or medicine are adding years to millions of lives look at the present with a broad view and through many resources to understand the present you should be aware of what is going on now no one can see the whole picture as in a global scale simultaneously but you can educate yourself by reading the news watching it on television and for more up to the minute information using internet resources think about the present in terms of what lays ahead of us rising oil prices global warming threats of pandemics and terrorist activities threaten the status quo improvements in agriculture medicine weather forecasting and industry offer hope for the future and how we receive or respond to these conditions and events in the present will shape the future realize tomorrow is not guaranteed to any of us this is the basis for living in the present or taking one day at a time to dwell on past mistakes or live in fear of the future is a counterproductive use of time and a certain way of letting uncontrollable circumstances steal your peace care about your own community few of us have a great impact on society but we can try to contribute to our local communities using the potential of the present to influence conditions in the future here are some ideas that may help take steps to conserve and decrease your contributions to global warming share what you have surplus of whether it is time food clothing or money listening to someone who is hurting or alone can be more valuable in the present tense than giving them the shirt off your back be willing to shoulder responsibility for causes instead of waiting for the government or a citizen s committee to meet to resolve a problem be aware that there are few things that time does not change if you are dealing with pain or loss in the present it may seem hopeless but the future remains to be seen so never give up,Philosophy-and-Religion

no religion at all 1 x research source if you feel like your religious freedoms are being illegally diminished you may have to protect your rights by going to court if you do not want to go to court you may also be able to protect your rights by trying to affect the legislative administrative or public processes defendants in religious freedom cases can take many forms including governments employers or school boards examples of religious freedom cases include prayer in schools government establishment of religion and improper discrimination in the workplace based on religious beliefs,hire a lawyer religious freedom in the united states is a constitutional right and can therefore be protected in the court system your freedom of religion can be protected outside of the court system as well in either situation a qualified civil rights lawyer will greatly increase your chances of successfully protecting your rights when they have been threatened and or diminished if you are a part of an organized religion e g christianity judaism islam talk to your religious leaders about lawyers they may know in addition talk to other members of your faith about possible recommendations if you do not get any qualified recommendations contact your state bar association s lawyer referral service using this service you will be asked a series of questions about your legal problem and you will be put in contact with qualified lawyers in your area when you meet with candidates be sure you ask about their past successes and whether they feel comfortable with the issues you are discussing for example if you are planning on going to court find a lawyer comfortable going to trial however if you plan on filing administrative complaints find a lawyer who practices administrative law ask about fees and make sure you feel comfortable paying what is charged while lawyers can be expensive you usually get what you pay for talk to civil rights organizations in addition to hiring a lawyer

public light by talking to the media for example the american civil liberties union aclu actively seeks clients who have had their individual rights trampled 2 x research source contact the aclu if

the aclu they will likely help you put together a media tour in fact the aclu has their own media department 3 x research source when you talk with the media you should explain your complaint in clear and concise language you should also make a plea for help from others who have experienced the same problems when you do this you will likely get phone calls emails and other correspondence from people willing to help help may come in the form of donations to help you pay for legal costs food and lodging if you have to travel or legal help if you are not already receiving any in addition the more people that share your concern the more traction your story will get become an activist whether your religious rights have been endangered or not if you believe in the freedom of religion you can protect those rights by becoming an activist an activist is someone who believes in a social cause and campaigns for that cause 4 x research source in order to effectively campaign for religious freedom you will have to understand the laws you are trying to effect at its most basic level religious freedoms are protected by the u s constitution s first amendment the first amendment has two religious clauses and countless federal and state laws protect those religious freedoms the establishment clause of the first amendment prohibits the government from encouraging or promoting religion under the establishment clause your religious rights may be diminished if government promoted a religion that is not yours the free exercise clause of the first amendment gives you the right to worship or not however you choose here your rights may be infringed if you are unable to worship due to a government law or policy 5 x research source the laws passed by federal state and local governments must all adhere to these constitutional principals if they do not they will likely be found unconstitutional by a court write to your representatives another way to fight for religious freedom is to write letters to your state and federal representatives and make your beliefs known these letters can be particularly persuasive considering you are the individual voting these people into office if they do not listen to your concerns they may not win reelection you can write your legislators as well as your executives i e the president and governor when you write a letter to your representatives state your purpose up front and be very clear about what you want your representative to do for example if there is a bill being debated in the senate that you believe diminishes your religious freedoms you might write a letter to your senator letting them know you want them to oppose the bill file government complaints prior to filing a lawsuit you may choose or be required to file a complaint with a state or federal agency agencies are departments tasked with making rules and executing the laws of a state or the federal government by filing an agency complaint you may get the relief you seek without ever going to court however in some circumstances you are required to file an agency complaint before you can file a lawsuit for example the department of justice doj gives you an opportunity to file a complaint if you feel your civil rights have been violated to file a complaint visit the doj website to determine what information you need to include and where your complaint needs to be sent this information will vary depending on the type of complaint you choose to file 6 x trustworthy source united states department of justice official website of the u s department of justice go to source you are required to file a complaint for example if you are alleging employment discrimination based on your religious beliefs e g being fired for wearing a hijab in the employment discrimination realm you must file a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc the eeoc will analyze your complaint and if they find sufficient evidence of discrimination they will issue you a right to sue letter only when you have this letter will you be able to file a lawsuit 7 x research source create a ballot initiative one way to ensure your religious freedoms are protected is to offer up a ballot initiative if your state allows them in california for example you can offer up a ballot initiative in order to propose and enact a law or an amendment to the california constitution to get a ballot initiative on the ballot next election you will have to draft the legal language of your initiative and present it to the secretary of state your initiative must also be certified by your local elected officials once this happens you will need to go out and get a certain number of qualified voter signatures 8 x research source when you meet these requirements your initiative will be placed on the state ballot to be voted on in the next election if your initiative passes it will become law protect everybody s religious freedoms if you only protect your own religious freedoms while other people s freedoms are being trampled you will be setting a precedent to allow religious freedoms in general to be violated if this happens your religious freedoms could be violated in the future based on the precedent you set for example if you are jewish you should also be vocal about christianity islam buddhism and other religions in the united states freedom of religion means you are free to practice whatever religion you like look for interfaith groups that work across religious lines to protect the broad freedom of religion get involved and do not focus on just one religion decide where to sue when you decide to sue someone for diminishing your religious freedoms the first important decision you will have to make is whether you will file your lawsuit in state or federal court depending on the circumstances you may be able to choose or you may be required to file in one or the other state courts are usually courts of general jurisdiction and can hear any case brought in front of them unless they are specifically barred from doing so on the other hand if you want to file your lawsuit in federal court you will have to meet one of two jurisdictional tests first you can file in federal court if you are suing under a federal law which includes the u s constitution i e federal question jurisdiction for example if you are suing an employer for employment discrimination you might decide to sue under the federal law prohibiting those actions second you can file in federal court if you have diversity of citizenship here you and the defendant must be citizens of different states and the amount in controversy must exceed 75 000 9 x research source if you can choose between the two you should most likely choose to file in federal court if you are suing based on a constitutional claim or a federal law claim the federal courts are much better equipped to handle your case draft a complaint a lawsuit is started when a complaint is filed with the court a complaint is a legal document that tells the judge and the defendant why you are suing someone how the defendant violated the law how you were injured and what you want the court to do about it your complaint will include at least the following 10 x research source the case caption which includes the court where you are filing your complaint and the parties to the suit the jurisdictional basis which tells the court why they can hear the case the nature of your suit and the cause of action i e what law you are filing under and how you have been harmed whether you want a jury your request for relief which is the dollar amount you are asking the defendant for fill out a summons form the summons is a document that demands that the defendant respond to your lawsuit the summons is an already completed form and all you have to do is include the defendant s name address and the time limit in which they have to respond the time frame a defendant must follow is laid out in state or federal rules of civil procedure in most cases it is usually around 30 days 11 x research source file your lawsuit when you have completed your complaint and summons you will take those forms to the courthouse and file them with the clerk of courts in federal court you can either file your case in person or by email if you can file in person it will allow you to discuss your paperwork with the clerk of courts once the clerk of courts verifies your paperwork he or she will ask you to pay a 400 filing fee this fee may be more or less in state court if you can afford the fee and pay it when you file your lawsuit will be stamped as filed and you will be assigned a judge and case number also you will receive a summons with the court s stamp on it which you will need when you serve the defendant if you cannot afford the fee you must file a motion to proceed in forma pauperis which asks the court to waive the fee a judge will have to rule on this motion before your fee will be waived if the motion is approved your lawsuit will be stamped as filed you will be assigned a case number and judge and you will receive an official summons from the court 12 x research source serve the other party you are required to notify the other party that they have been sued and you do that by serving them with a copy of the complaint and summons under federal law you have 120 days from when you file to serve the defendant if you are in state court you may have more or less time every defendant in your suit must be individually served to serve the defendant you will have someone personally hand the documents to the defendant or have them send the documents by certified mail if you are in state court you can hire the sheriff s office to conduct service if you are in federal court you can get the u s marshal s service to conduct service if the court approves it 13 x research source file the return of service forms once the defendant has been served the person who served them will complete a return of service form this form asks the server to verify that service was indeed completed when this form is completed it will be returned to you you will have to file the completed form with the clerk of courts so the court knows service has been completed 14 x research source await an answer if the defendant responds to your lawsuit it will usually be in the form of an answer an answer responds to each of your allegations by either admitting or denying them in addition the defendant may make cross claims against you if cross claims are made against you you will have to respond as if you were the defendant if a defendant fails to respond to your lawsuit the court may enter a default judgment in your favor when this happens you will be awarded the relief you sought in your complaint 15 x research source take part in discovery the first stage of litigation is discovery which is when you and the defendant exchange information for the purpose of preparing for trial during discovery you will learn the identity of witnesses and gather relevant documents if the defendant does not comply with your discovery requests you can file motions with the court to ask it to require the defendant to comply in general the following tools can be used during discovery in order to gather information 16 x research source depositions which are in person interviews with the defendant or other witnesses these interviews are conducted under oath and answers given can be used in court interrogatories which are written questions that a defendant or other witness is required to answer the answers are written under oath and can be used in court document requests which are written requests for documents relevant to your case documents can include emails internal memos photographs and graphs requests for admissions which ask the defendant to admit the truth of facts or the genuineness of documents defend against a motion for summary judgment as soon as discovery concludes most defendants will file a motion for summary judgment which asks the court to decide the litigation before it gets to trial in order to be successful the defendant will have to prove there are no genuine issues of material fact and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law the court will make every assumption in your favor at this point you can defend against this motion by submitting your own evidence and affidavits that show the court there are facts in dispute that need to be decided at trial if you succeed in defending against this motion the litigation will continue 17 x research source attempt to settle at this point in the litigation right before trial begins you may want to attempt to settle your case in order to avoid the additional cost and time commitment of going to trial when you attempt to settle you and the defendant will get together and discuss what a reasonable award would be given the fact you are both winning if the case doesn t go to trial the amount you settle for and the time you take attempting to come to an agreement will be based on how strong you think your case is the stronger your case the less likely it is you will settle for less than what you would get at trial in addition to informal negotiations you and the defendant might also take part in mediation which takes place when a neutral third party sits down with you and the defendant to discuss common ground and areas of agreement the third party will not take sides and will not make any opinions about the case arbitration which takes place when a third party hears evidence from both parties and makes conclusions based on the evidence they hear the third party will take sides here and will give you their opinion about the case attend final pretrial hearings during your final pretrial hearings before trial begins you and the defendant will meet with the judge to discuss how the trial is likely to proceed the trial will be limited to the issues and claims brought up during this pretrial hearing 18 x research source choose a jury if your case goes to trial you will have the opportunity to have it heard before a judge or before a jury this decision must be made in your complaint if you chose to waive your right to a jury your case will be held in front of a judge who will make every substantive decision about your case if you chose to have your case heard by a jury you will take part in voire dire which is the process for choosing a jury during voire dire you will have the opportunity to question potential jurors about their biases and ability to be impartial if you think a juror is biased you can ask to have them dismissed when a jury is chosen they will be sworn in and the trial will begin 19 x research source make an opening statement your opening statement should outline the case you will make for the jury or for the judge and will provide a road map explaining your case the opening statement is not a time to present evidence and you should not complicate things at this time your opening statement should be short and to the point once you give your opening statement the defendant will have an opportunity to do the same however the defendant can also choose to hold off and make a statement right before they present their case present your case when opening statements are complete you will present you case by calling witnesses to the stand and introducing evidence through them you will ask each witness questions and present evidence in accordance with the local rules of evidence when you are done questioning each witness the defendant will have an opportunity to cross examine them and try to poke holes in their testimony cross examine witnesses once your case has been presented and you have rested the defense will have their opportunity to present their case after the defendant questions each of their witnesses you will have an opportunity to cross examine them in order to call into question their testimony you will do this by showing the witness was either untruthful or unreliable for example if a defense witness stated one thing during direct examination but the complete opposite during a deposition you will want to bring this to light during cross examination make your closing argument when you and the defendant have rested you will have an opportunity to make a closing argument to the jury or judge your closing argument is an opportunity to go over the key points of your case persuade the judge or jury you deserve to win and to make any final points you need to make once you make your closing statement the defendant will have an opportunity to make one as well await a verdict when the trial is over the jury or judge will deliberate about what they heard before making a final decision after deliberations the decision maker will make their decision and issue a verdict the verdict is the final decision of the trial if you win judgment will be entered in your favor and damages will be awarded if you lose judgment will be entered in the defendant s favor and you will not be able to collect any money 20 x research

how to understand the concept it s all in your hands,having different obstacles and expecting same results promises to make our life that much interesting but trying same things and expecting different results is stupidity in an attempt to live a perfect life all we find at the end of the line is a perfect lie in a constant pursuit of happiness and prosperity we lose what we need the most at the end of the day its the simplest things as a result to this constant rat race we fall apart and end up in a place where we feared we would be it s like took what i hated and made it a part of me linkin park despite all this we deny all this for one pursuit that would make us regret all our deeds and leave you hungry for love when you re having a feast of finest and the best but ask yourself if that is really what you wanted out of life life was is and always will be simple it is we who try to implement new things and create obstacles for ourselves and sit around crying despite knowing you know where to crack the wall reason is simple it s all in our hands if this is your story here are some rules that helped me during my time of need,lose all expectations someone great once said best way to achieve a new skill is by letting go of an old one never lose hope no matter how bad things turn out to be no matter how ugly things get never lose hope it s powerful always understand a life is worth no material thing life is an exceptional gift don t just throw it away cherish each movement of it let go of all your suicidal tendencies know when to give up there are times when you dig deep and put up a fight and there are those when you throw in the towel especially when family sentiments are involved deny there is defeat or an end faith in self takes you a long way it could be a dog fight or it be a space odyssey remember there is always a different way of doing things if you try a hundred things there are any number of ways of doing a same thing always find a way be a ray of hope better than a scissor severing spine on any given day learn to live with your mistakes being human beings makes us vulnerable to making mistakes no one is perfect if they say so that means there is a lot more mistakes making up for the surface like moon form a distance understand that there are always consequences knowing there are consequences is the true meaning of all our lives newton tried to explain this and was proclaimed a genius but if you tell that to a lost soul you will be despised a fool,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to read ogham stones,the ogham stones refer to stone monuments inscribed with messages from ancient celtic tribes the messages are all in ogham which is the earliest form of irish language these 400 stones are sprinkled around the coasts of the irish sea in ireland wales england and the isle of man unless you re fluent in ancient forms of gaelic reading the stones will prove fairly difficult however if you re patient and have a keen eye you can translate each stone to a legible form of primitive irish and translate that into your language category reading,read the stone from the bottom to the top if it s vertical if the ogham stone sits vertically in the ground start on the bottom and work your way to the top look for the lowest mark available and work your way up any gaps in the markings indicate the separation of a word although you may need to separate them yourself after you translate it if the marks are close together 1 x research source many of these stones are weathered away from centuries of erosion you may only be able to figure out what some of the message means go from the right to the left if the stone is horizontal horizontal stones tend to be much harder to read for one they tend to be more worn down than the vertical stones in addition it s hard to figure out which side is the right and which side is the left since you can stand on either side if you re near water assume that you face the water to read the stone 2 x research source if the stone is embedded next to a hill or large rock assume you read the stone by facing the geological feature it s next to if you translate a horizontal stone and the message simply doesn t make sense you may have stood on the wrong side of the stone unfortunately there s no way around this find the guideline by looking for the longest line in the middle of the hash marks every ogham inscription is placed along a single line that guides the sentence look for a long thin line carved into the stone on a vertical stone this line starts on the ground and goes up on a horizontal stone it will run the length of the stone 3 x research source this line is sort of like the line on a piece of notebook paper that guides a sentence many of the ogham stones use a corner as the vertical line that guides the inscription if the marks are on a sharp edge of the stone treat the entire corner as the line you need letters in ogham are determined based on their relationship to this line for example a single mark going to the left of the line is the letter h while a single line going right of the line is a b a single line that goes both right and left of the line is actually an a write the letters down as you read the stone to translate the stone yourself grab a notebook and a pencil it is much easier to write the letters down as you work and separate them later for translation if you re in a time crunch you can draw the entire carving and translate the drawing later 4 x research source if you re on vacation with your family they probably aren t going to be happy about you sitting in front of a stone for 20 minutes to translate a 1500 year old burial stone these readings can take some time you can always take a photo if you re really in a rush treat changes in the pattern as new letters and spaces as new words some of the stones have gaps between each set of markings treat these gaps as new words you can find where a new letter starts by looking for a change in the pattern every letter in ogham is a series of repetitive marks or a single mark so if the pattern changes it s a new letter 5 x research source if there are no spaces you ll need to do some guessing when it comes to separating the letters out into individual words look for horizontal hash marks that stick out right for n s f l and b if you see any sets of straight horizontal marks sticking out of the right of the central guideline carved in the stone count how many hash marks appear next to one another to determine the letter keep in mind the hash marks must form a 90 degree angle or close to it off of the main line on the stone 6 x research source one mark b two marks l three marks f four marks s five marks n use horizontal marks that go left to note q c t d and h you will also note several horizontal marks that stick out to the left of the main line again these marks must form 90 degree angles to the central line guiding the message 7 x research source one mark h two marks d three marks t four marks c five marks q note lines that run at an angle to find r z ng g and m some of the hash marks are not perfectly perpendicular to the central line these marks rest at an angle on the central line although they ll always run in the same direction parallel to one another these slanted marks always extend all the way through the center line 8 x research source one mark at an angle m two marks at an angle g three marks at an angle ng four marks at an angle st or z 9 x research source five marks at an angle r spot i e u o and a by looking for horizontal marks that bisect the guideline if a horizontal line runs all the way through the center line i e to the right and left it is a vowel luckily the romanized vowels of primitive irish are identical to english which makes translating a little easier keep in mind these lines must sit at a 90 degree angle on both sides of the center line 10 x research source one mark a two marks o three marks u four marks e five marks i treat dots that appear on the guideline as alternative ways to write vowels on many of the ogham stones the original author used dots instead of lines to indicate vowels if you see some round notches etched into the center line treat these dots like vowels on a handful of stones the dots appear next to the center line 11 x research source one dot a two dots o three dots u four dots e five dots i interpret the runic symbols as vowel groupings and use both letters ogham only uses lines and dots to produce letters but many of the older ogham stones contain symbols that do not conform to the alphabet these symbols relate to pronunciations or vowel groups and they are often used as shorthand for names include both vowels in your translation 12 x research source an x carved over the center line ea a square bisected on opposite corners by the center line oi a sequence of 90 degree angles forming a curl ui two sets of parallel lines sticking out of the center line and crossing ia a checkerboard pattern ae search each individual word online to decode what it means once you ve converted the entire sentence into primitive irish look each word up in a search engine to find what it means in your language unfortunately there are no reliable primitive irish translation tools online so you ll have to look each word up individually 13 x research source there is a formula you can use to convert the letters to basque a language in europe and look the definitions up in a complete dictionary but this is kind of complicated it s much easier to search the word on its own 14 x research source some words are unknown and have not been completely translated look for words maqi or mucoi to note memorials to the dead most of the ogham stones are memorials to the dead the celtic people that used ogham are thought to have erected these stones for funerary purposes you ll often find maqi which means son of or mucoi which roughly means of the tribe if you spot either of these words you re looking at a burial stone 15 x research source you may also stumble on maqiritte which is a combination of son and stone it roughly translates to the stone of some of the stones have odd inscriptions or phrases one stone reads to compare with the name of the horse 16 x research source treat every word with no translation as a name if you cannot find the meaning of a word you translated the odds are extremely high that it is someone s name it may also be the name of celtic family or tribe if it appears after the word mucoi assume these unfamiliar words are names 17 x research source often the names are gods the word lugaddon appears often on the stones this is a reference to lugh a warrior god in irish mythology see if the stone you found has a full translation online to check your work many of the stones have been fully translated and you can find the full text in your language in a reference work online search online for the stone that you found by typing in the location followed by the phrase ogham stone if any scholars have translated it you ll be able to check your work and see how close you got 19 x research source some of the stones have not been translated they re either too worn down or the original author wasn t very careful with their carving look for the stones in southern ireland if you re seeking them out the largest concentration of ogham stones is in southern ireland roughly 360 of the stones are found in ireland while the other 40 or so are spread across the coasts of england wales and the isle of man if you really want to see the stones ireland is hands down your best bet 20 x research source the stones outside of ireland are mostly older and were mainly carved between 800 1100 ce visit stone corridor in cork for the largest museum collection the biggest catalogued collection of stones is at the university college of cork in the city of cork the school maintains a collection of 20 stones which can be found in a hallway on the western side of the campus stop by the university to take a look 22 x research source you can also call the university to see if they offer guided tours go to the dingle peninsula in kerry to find the stones yourself the single largest collection of unexcavated stones is found in corca dhuibhne also known as the dingle peninsula which is in county kerry roughly 60 stones are found here but there are hundreds of other megaliths and ancient monuments as well if you re going relic seeking on your own this is hands down the best place to find some ancient artifacts 23 x research source if you re staying in ireland specifically to go look at artifacts in the dingle peninsula the port town of dingle is a great place to stay if larger cities are more your vibe stay in tralee which is a popular tourist spot just outside of the peninsula keep an eye out for tall stones with horizontal hash marks on them in your travels look for large stone tablets embedded in the ground the ogham stones are all different but most of them are 8 14 feet 2 4 4 3 m tall if you spot a stone sticking out of the ground look to see if it has horizontal lines carved all over it if it does you just found an ogham stone 24 x research source some of the stones sit horizontally on the ground but the vast majority of them are planted vertically a handful of the stones have signs or placards next to them so keep an eye out for modern signs set up near large stones as you re traveling around however many of the stones are just sitting out in nature 25 x research source unfortunately it can be hard to find maps of where the stones are located you can search online to see if there are any stones in the county or area where you re staying though,Philosophy-and-Religion

sufficient if at all possible begin to prepare yourself for the trip while you are saving money consider the other things necessary to living in a foreign country begin taking classes to at least familiarize yourself with any foreign languages you will encounter learn basic practical and religious phrases that will help you thrive also think about what will happen to your home and car do what

to hold church in a spare room for awhile before purchasing a bigger building mix with the locals if you live in the capital city or a large city you should know the location of your country s embassy find the local market and learn where to purchase drinking water make sure you are polite and friendly but do not hesitate to stand up to someone trying to rip you off dress a bit on the conservative side until you know how comfortable the people are with your native dress look for work if you did your research well and are interested in earning a living try to find available work individual countries have their own requirements and you will need to find out what sort of jobs you are qualified for acquire a translator if you do not speak the language proficiently you may need the services of a translator for any sort of gathering which you speak at begin to find people interested in hearing the good news if you try and live a clean and decent life in most cultures people notice they will be intrigued by your foreignness and charmed by your attempts to learn about their culture try to keep your talk centered around god thanking him for your good health etc answer their questions

how to explore theories and live beyond them,exploring different theories of belief and existence is something everyone does at some point the problem is that there are so many how do you make the right belief choices live them out and go beyond them spend time exploring these theories on a regular basis will help you to clarify your own beliefs and how you should behave as a result,consider what your own point of views are and what you believe write these down and look at how they influence your way of thinking and acting these might be theories on anything such as why we are here how we are here what is right and what is wrong and so on consider how you got them did you get them from your education from your relatives friends or mentors did you get them from mainstream society or are they your own theories examine alternative points of view to your own if you have ever had someone else disagree or offer an alternative idea to one of your own examine that one and why you select your own above another persons try to see if the other persons ideas are valid sometimes one person is right and one is wrong but sometimes both can have different but valid points of view and sometimes theories are right in some conditions and wrong in others go back to your ideas first and compare the two try not to have any bias or prejudice to another persons ideas or your own but just see how ideas give you and another person advantages and disadvantages explore if any theories are bullet proof many theories or views often are relevant in some cases but not relevant in others and that an opposite idea might have merit look for any points of view that are applicable in every case how rare are they if you can find some explore why they are 100 consistent and if they have an opposite if you can find none try to find out why that it is by looking a little deeper and asking more questions explore the current relevancy to points of view ask other people their ideas and examine wisdom and culture generally is there some ideas that become redundant in changes of technology some examples of old ideas might be that the world is flat or that diseases are caused by magic by sailing around the world it was shown the idea of a flat world was incorrect and today is no longer relevant in the same way it wasn t until the microscope was invented to see viruses and bacteria that cause many illnesses that we know that its not spells and curses try to apply different ideas to your own they might seem bizarre and totally foreign but see if they work and have any value consider that views and ideas are just part of the thing we call an identity and culture as well as how we perceive and remember events and the strength of how we feel and react to events and impulses consider this analogy a persons mind is like the room we live in ideas and beliefs are like the wallpaper or paint we put up to personalize our room is it possible that with so much wallpaper we have papered or painted over the windows and doorways so we cannot see beyond our own mindset examine if there are in the world many people who go through life without seeing beyond their own ideas and if that limits them or harms them and others are you or other people prisoners in a gilded cage of ideas and beliefs de clutter your own mind if you feel that you are a prisoner start to let go of some ideas and see if you can live without them you don t have to abandon them all although try to see if it is possible to live without them entirely and if that does in fact set you free if that gives you benefit or well being tear down some of that wallpaper and let the light in if that makes you feel nervous try to see why is there a loyalty to that theory or something you identify with or are you fond of a particular idea above what is really happening consider the relevance of this analogy a person can know some things as real and true but if they explore what they don t know and cannot find answers they should not be ashamed to say they don t know there is a true honesty in admitting you don t know the things you don t rather than making up something in order to be certain if things change and it is possible for the truth to be known then a truly honest person would not be ashamed to examine it and accept it consider finally that there are not many truths but one that things are true or that they aren t what is true does not belong to anyone any society or any idea but is relevant to everyone anywhere try to find the truth that applies to everyone beyond ideas theories and cultures and how that can help yourself and other people,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to get a religion degree online,the flexibility of attaining a degree online is attractive to those in society who cannot be tied to the structure of a residential learning experience if mobility is your game or responsibilities like caring for loved ones prevent you from obtaining a degree on a physical campus then consider online classes be forewarned the classes which you pursue online are every bit as difficult if not more so than classes on a traditional campus setting you should be very self disciplined to commit to the amount of research study and time necessary to accomplish your goals,let the idea that money is a barrier flee from your mind as you consider your educational options also colleges like liberty university and liberty theological seminary even allow the admission fee to be deducted later from your financial aid you can apply online without any money books costs are also deducted later you are given a voucher with which to purchase your books from their affiliated bookstore online make sure schools are accredited try to stay away from diploma mills these are easily researched online and many are noticeable by their extremely high tuition once you have chosen your college call admissions and speak with someone as a person who loathes these types of procedures i have found that this method works better because admission counselors are there to help you they know information that you do not and they can connect you with the right degree program research the minimum gpa requirement many schools only require a 2 4 to gain admittance to their college while other programs or colleges may require a 3 0 or higher do not let your grade point average deter you from your degree in certain instances you can obtain conditional admission allowing you to take prerequisite courses before you are officially admitted into the regular courses this can easily raise your grade point average do thorough research concerning financial aid do your front work and make sure you are cooperative and proactive in getting this information in check and double check your forms and resources there is an online banking institution called higher one which allows your financial aid to be disbursed as a student checking and debit account it is without a monthly fee and if you use your debit card as a credit card there are no small fees for using the card for payment higher one was designed by students you obtain faster access to your financial aid because as soon as the funds are disbursed to your college they automatically transfer these funds to your account be aware that you will receive a rather large sum of money at one time the temptation may be there to splurge use common sense and pay your bills first then if there is an item that you can realistically afford then perhaps purchase it but not before serious consideration there is nothing like checking your bank account and realizing it is empty one month before any financial aid is due although many class schedules allow for working a part time job some of the programs are so rigorous and additional responsibilities may not allow for paid work let your degree be your full time job as much as possible financial aid for online classes is the same as for residential classes in many instances the additional benefit of online classes is that you do not have to travel back and forth to campus you may prefer studying at home or a local library or coffee shop with the technology available with iphones and androids many lessons and lectures may be listened to anywhere even as you jog down the path discussion boards online are also easily accessed from any location with these devices although appropriate reference material should be nearby as these discussion boards are highly intellectual and require book citations to back up your views or stances financial aid is one of the more tricky areas to maneuver around you must have all your college and financial information available this includes your program of study your start and projected end date and your yearly income from tax records whether you are a dependent or independent student also decides the amount of financial aid available for instance liberty university allows all information to be submitted and the fafsa or federal financial aid application to be submitted online as do most colleges it is also very important to consider whether the funds you are entitled to will need to be allocated over two or three semesters make sure you complete your fafsa as soon as possible because it takes several days to be determined for financial aid purposes if you attend fall and spring semester and intend to work summer semester then call financial aid and have them walk you through the process of making that clear on your financial aid arrangements it takes about two minutes online if you intend on attending classes all three semesters then you can divide the funds between the three semesters this allows a larger amount of funds to be obtained between just two semesters than if they are divided out among three semesters if you are in a position of caring for a loved one then perhaps the division between three semesters is better another very important factor to consider is that fall semester is five months long so far as financial aid is concerned why this happens is december falls at the end of fall semester and this leaves several additional weeks which require one to carefully consider their resources check the price of books again liberty university has a student friendly approach they allow all books to be ordered two or three weeks before classes start so you may begin reading your material the prices of the books that are ordered are deducted from the upcoming financial aid although you may be able to purchase these books on amazon or elsewhere much cheaper make sure the isbn numbers match exactly or you may have the wrong book msbn allows a student voucher code to be entered in order to purchase books when you order make sure you state the correct semester or the class materials may be different online financial aid does not disburse the first day of class at liberty it does not disburse until 25 days later this is a blessing and a curse it is a blessing because you are not anxious to go spend the money in your account because it isn t there a curse because with beginning new classes there is the additional burden of figuring how to pay the bills until another month has passes again many of the classes are very rigorous you will not have time to work let your classes be your job,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to explore the philosophy of religion,the philosophy of religion deals with the big questions about god and religion does god exist are we justified in believing in god should we make a leap of faith what ought our response be to evil and suffering if god exists what properties does he have are religions compatible with one another can we communicate with god through prayer and can he communicate with us through religious experiences is a belief in god compatible with a respect for science,make the distinction between philosophy of religion and theology philosophy of religion attempts to investigate the philosophical underpinnings of religion and religious beliefs about god for instance theology combines some philosophical reflection on these topics with reflection on religious beliefs that take some of the answers for granted that philosophers of religion would want to question prepare yourself personally for studying philosophy of religion unlike other branches of philosophy philosophy of religion questions and seeks reasons for ideas around religion and faith for many people their religious faith or lack of is a very personal and subjective matter and discussing it frankly and openly in a classroom may be uncomfortable decide whether or not you truly want to take part in such discussions and be prepared to change your mind one way to dodge the problem of personal involvement is to mentally rethink the arguments without the term god the term god brings with it a whole set of beliefs and assumptions when presented with an argument mentally substitute god for x then you can work through the logic of the argument without bringing your personal beliefs about god into the question of whether or not the argument works on a logical level familiarise yourself with the arguments for and against the existence of god the three main types of arguments are the cosmological or first cause argument the ontological argument and the teleological or design argument start with an introductory text the philosophy of religion a critical introduction by brian and beverly clack is often recommended to undergraduates one good way of doing this is to read a book by a theist and by an atheist for the theistic side the existence of god and is there a god both by richard swinburne are recommended and on the atheist side try either robin le poedevin s arguing for atheism an introduction to the philosophy of religion or michael martin s atheism a philosophical justification explore the ontological argument more deeply many philosophers of religion both theist and atheist will agree that the ontological argument is perhaps the most interesting of the philosophical arguments for the existence of god it was originally proposed by st anselm you can read his presentation of it in the proslogion another form of the argument is presented in part v of descartes meditations this was criticised by kant in the critique of pure reason more recently contemporary philosophers of religion have revived the argument in a more technical manner the two philosophers to read on this are norman malcolm and alvin plantinga learn about the cosmological arguments cosmological arguments argue for the existence of god by positing that an external supernatural force is necessary to explain a certain physical or metaphysical aspect of the universe 1 x research source thomas aquinas is credited with coming up with the original cosmological arguments in his work summa theologica in which he argues for god as a necessary first cause and the measure of all things gottfried wilhelm leibniz proposed his own version of the cosmological argument in which he employed what he called the principle of sufficient reason the leibnizian argument posited that each thing that exists must have sufficient reason for its existence and this explanation is not found in the natural world consider the epistemic questions about faith learn about the idea of fidelism and read up on pascal s wager attempt to answer the question is it rational to believe in god do believers in god have evidence for their beliefs if they don t have evidence can it still be rational to believe in god is a religious or spiritual experience evidence consider the divine attributes many of the sort of questions one may ask in sunday school are actual problems that philosophers of religion attempt to resolve questions like can god create a rock so big he couldn t lift it or homer simpson s variation on the theme could jesus microwave a burrito so hot he couldn t eat it are questioning the compatibility of the omnimax conception of god omnipotence omnipresence omniscience omnibenevolence god being all powerful everywhere all knowing and all loving specifically whether god s omnimax properties ever conflict with one another or with the laws of logic or of nature some good introductions to these questions are gerard j hughes book the nature of god anthony kenny s book the god of the philosophers t v morris the concept of god and richard swinburne s the coherence of theism think about the role of religious language some philosophers in the logical positivist movement considered religious language to be cognitively meaningless and to lack reference a j ayer and rudolf carnap hold this kind of position some other philosophers try to interpret religious language in a naturalistic reductionist manner reducing claims about god to being claims about ethics see r b braithwaite and kant some mystics and religious thinkers deem it impossible to describe god because of his infiniteness and so prefer to talk about what god is not this is described as the via negativa in recent times many philosophers of religion have interpreted religious language through the lens of wittgenstein s latter theories to learn more about this look at dan r stiver s book the philosophy of religious language sign symbol and story think about the problem of evil how can we say that we live in a universe created and ruled by an omnibenevolent and all powerful god when he allows so much pain and suffering to occur this question has been a primary line of argument from atheists and agnostics and one that religious philosophers find the most difficult to answer a number of theodicies have been presented that attempt to respond to these criticisms the main theodicies to consider are the free will argument including plantinga s formulation of it and the soul making theodicy as presented by john hick engage in dialogue and write it is no good just reading the literature philosophy is not a spectator sport attempt to develop the arguments yourself think them through write down your thoughts and discuss them with others it can be difficult finding people who have also studied the philosophical literature in depth this may mean finding people on the internet attending seminars conferences and lectures at universities or becoming a student one good way to keep up with the literature is to subscribe to a philosophy of religion blog a number of good blogs exist prosblogion and common sense atheism are two that are worth reading the former is intended more for professional academics in philosophy of religion while the latter is suited for a wider audience,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to set up a worship set,did you want to have a successful worship song set this article will explain how to worship in a way that is both easy to play and allows others to worship uninterrupted as well,listen to god if god wants you to play a specific song and you are close enough in your relationship with him he will tell you specific songs to play however don t mix the voice of god with your voice saying ooh i really like this song you ll know it s from god if you don t know why you should be playing it this is extremely important as you don t want to miss what god is trying to tell his people find out if the pastor leader wants you to play any specific songs maybe you can incorporate one or two of those find out who you are leading worship for depending on the crowd you are going to want to use different types of music in some situations you ll want to use hymns like be thou my vision in others you ll want to use older songs like every move i make in others you ll want brand new songs like 10 000 reasons or our god is greater and in some other situations you will want to combine all three generally this has to do with the people within the church and not the type of church it is so go up to the pastor worship leader or some type of leader and ask them to list off a few songs they normally play and base your song choice off of that find out any important topic information if you are playing for someone else who is speaking which you probably will be you will want to try to match your songs with the topic of the speaking for instance if the speaker is talking about how we should do everything as if we were doing it for christ you might want to play every move i make or jesus paid it all or anything that is related to the words to be spoken make a list of possible songs with their original key once you have all the information about the types of songs you want to use you are going to want to put all options into a list with their keys next to them if you don t know the keys look them up online and you should be able to find the key information and if not just guess what you think it might be in of course if god told you any specific songs you will want to have those in their as well even if they don t match the style of the church or the message find out how many songs you are expected to play if you end up having too many songs for the time allotted you will have to stop early and the set will sound unfinished if you have too few songs the set will sound awkward you may have to fill time by playing again one of the songs you already played this is to be avoided at all costs find out how many songs you have time for when you will be playing them and whether or not they are split up for example the venue could tell you that you will be playing eight songs so you set up those eight songs but when you get there you find out you are playing four songs before the message and four songs after which screws up the transitions you made for the 4th and 5th song find any combinations of songs that go together this is where the keys come in find songs that have the same or close to the same key example a song in b flat and a song in c are close enough together to be considered similar as you can change the key of one or even both of the songs without making any drastic changes these songs will go together quite well especially if they are in the same time signature one thing that really makes worship awkward is when the worship team finishes a song it becomes completely quiet and the crowd starts hearing the movement of capos on guitars you are going to want to make easy transitions and this means either having the songs in the same key or similar keys once you have the songs that go together you are ready for the next step arrange the songs while setting up the arrangement you want to make sure you keep similar songs together to make smooth transitions if it s not possible don t fret it s not that big of a deal once you are completely done with the arrangement of songs move on to the next step there are multiple ways to set up a set depending on how many songs you are playing and when you are playing them you will want to play upbeat songs early normal songs in the middle and intimate songs towards the end if you are playing a lot of songs six or more before the message you will want to start off with upbeat songs that get people on their feet like sing sing sing by chris tomlin or your love never fails by jesus culture around halfway get into a normal tempo like better is one day then towards the end drop down to intimate like this is the air i breathe or prepare the way if you are playing fewer songs before the message four or five you will want to keep the same structure but keep it more on the upbeat side throughout don t go all the way intimate if you are playing just a couple songs before the message one to three you will want to keep the same style throughout preferably upbeat or normal if you are playing many songs after the message you will want to start off with an intimate feeling then halfway through get all the way up to upbeat then back down to normal or even intimate if you are playing a few songs after the message you will want to do the same structure as a lot of songs but on the intimate side meaning don t have the upbeat songs if you are playing just a couple of songs after the message keep them the same tempo preferably normal or intimate arrange a split set now this whole thing changes a lot when your set is split up like the example above if you are playing a lot of songs both before and after play upbeat songs up front then slow down to more normal songs towards the middle then speed up right before the message to upbeat after the message start off with some really slow intimate songs speed up to normal and end with intimate this is at variance with the prior step the reason you want to do this is because if you are playing more than six songs before and after the message you risk tiring out your crowd s attention span so you need to mix it up if you go to see a band play live notice that they throw in some random really upbeat or really intimate songs so you keep listening and you want this same thing in worship because otherwise they will stop worshipping if you are playing a few songs before start with upbeat and end with normal the rest of the information is the same as above figure out transitions you want to keep the music flowing from one song to the next and not have any sudden stops when the next song is in the same key keep playing the chord progression on an acoustic guitar very lightly and then change the progression according to the next song and continue if two adjoining songs aren t in the same key you can possibly make it sound like they are in the same key for instance if you are playing a song in c and are changing to a song in g you can keep playing c and g over and over again as they are in both c key and g key then change to the g progression and it won t be at all noticeable unless your a musician even if there is just one note that s the same within the two keys you might be able to have your guitarist keep playing that note and then continue in the next key once someone starts playing the new chord progression another way is to have the drummer keep playing and then have the rest of the band join in after changing keys this can sound great if done right if none of those are possibilities have someone on your team pray or give a brief message while someone else starts playing the new chords the audience will pay attention to the voice and not the music submit the list for approval to whomever is in charge this is crucial this both tells them that you care about their feedback and makes certain you don t offend anyone some churches may have spiritual or policy disagreements with certain songs practice practice practice most part time worship teams less frequently than is optimal practice at least once a week if not more this will both ensure that you remember what you are doing and will help you focus more on god rather than on the music while leading worship play and have fun don t get stressed out about this god has it all under control don t feel nervous when you are playing you are just playing for your brothers and sisters in christ,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to explore understand value or quality in life,value or quality has been a long standing complex part of life what is quality what is value what makes life or gives our lives quality that we can value and appreciate there are many times when things seem to take a different light or sense of importance and when innocent or pure value or quality sometimes seems present in something or sometimes completely absent part of the problem is simply that when our experiences have no value we cannot appreciate them when we cannot appreciate what we have we can fall into depression and unhappiness that our life is of no worth or achieved nothing this problem creates misery for many the way to resolve it is to open the whole problem up for within the problem like so many others is a solution that can work for us as individuals,start by examining what you feel is a quality experience in your own life this will require you to think primarily about times in your life when things seemed to have quality or value and then look rationally at the opposite times when they didn t select one of these to test preferable one that had a lot of value to you because these are easier to handle without creating unpleasant feelings look carefully at the memory firstly to see if it is still fresh and accurate and not too dulled over a long time here it is best to compare the two what underwrites the ones we feel are lacking or not quality moments were the ones where there was an aspect of dissatisfaction present in the moment or afterwards on evaluation it is important to explore this dissatisfaction because this is the central aspect of every time we feel unhappy further explore the varieties of this dissatisfaction consider that there might be the case where the event seemed exciting at first but over long term handling or experience it seems dull like a commodity for example you might find at first going out for a meal to be exciting and fun but if you have to buy your meal everyday it soon seems ordinary and loses interest where a meal cooked by yourself or by someone you care for is a different experience consider how much money was involved in the experience as this can affect the quality or value there is a case where a person may hold the view have said that if you don t charge for services no one will appreciate its value what really happens however is that the cost paid for it dulls the experience because the money itself has to be earned so it has its own relative cost to us as individuals it returns to being a commodity as you are paying for it therefore you have an expectation of your money or ultimately your efforts getting what they are worth or a return of investment both parts actually make quite special things seem very ordinary and unimportant and the experience of quality and sense of value is lost it is important to consider however this exercise really is not about expecting people to do things for nothing for the flipside is that when you value something you are often more likely to bid higher for it to attain that goal additionally many needed services just won t exist without money to cover their costs so the balance is between money making operations or exploitative and the differences between them part of the problem and indeed the solution is this same relative cost and return process when we feel it wasn t worth the cost or that we paid more than it was worth we are dissatisfied consider times that you have found satisfaction in doing something by yourself a simple case is working in the home or garden when you decorate your space yourself it feels so much more genuine than if you paid someone to do it for you this is because of your personal involvement and efforts to achieve a goal goal setting and achievement being a big booster to our personal confidence management skills and personal satisfaction consider likewise if your selected experience you were unsatisfied with had a mental or emotional cost it may have been you were manipulated pressured begged or flattered into doing something that if you had a choice you would say no to or offered a product that while may have been good quality seems overpriced many methods exist in coercing a person to do something they don t want this has a terrible cost to both sides the alternative is when you do something for someone else or vice versa without any obligation or expectation but just out of friendship kindness or compassion or share moments with people in a beneficial context it seems so much more precious and these are the memories that people cherish this is because there is no physical or mental cost paid or that the cost had a return of satisfaction this is well reflected in people who follow a virtue system volunteer their time or live a little more frugally within their economic means the sacrifice of personal time and efforts or practicing self control against our easier desires gives in effect a return of the investment of effort these practitioners typically feel more satisfaction and more frequent satisfaction and so develop a sense of life quality but also appreciate things and people wisely and are consequently appreciated and valued by others this gives satisfaction which increases the sense of value and quality consider the alternative cases where you are prepared to pay whatever the cost is this will help you explore the limitations or ways to more wisely practice activities that will increase value and not compromise it when we are driven to extremes about what may seem virtuous or good actions will compromise and happiness this is because we no longer have any control our feelings effectively turned rogue and we lose that self direction there is a host of areas where this applies it may be a social or community aspects religious or spiritual environmental economical identity political and nationality issues you may be very passionate about its all about reflecting that while these may be good things within themselves is it possible that a person may have such strong desires to get involved even if it goes too far and breaks the law there are cases more mundane such as you want to buy a particular type of car so you over extend your finances to be able to get it even when you only use it for something a more economical car would be appropriate when it has reached the extremes primarily self importance has over ruled which drives people to do these actions which can be reflected in how easy it is for a person to step back and let go there are cases where a person just wants to be personally involved for it has become personal or through peer pressure is encouraged into doing it this also has a terrible cost because it develops into the feeling that nothing becomes important anymore in order to achieve that goal cases also exist similar to addictions where because of the feeling of power we gain these cases may constantly seek a way to be involved and express their feelings the return of investment can also be corrupted a person may also go into the habit that they will only do something for someone else but only if they get something in return quality is diminished very easily and its largely when it is tainted by greed or obligation which reduces the true satisfaction that builds wisdom and happiness think about this proportionate to the attachment or passion you have with anything is equal to the dangers most people are willing to go to this is most self evident in wars also equal is the amount of pain and despair you may feel if it doesn t go the way you want such as if you lose what you had that investment in consider experiences you ve had where simple or free things seemed to have the most value it might be something like a picnic with family or friends doing some basic housekeeping for someone you care about growing a plant or cooking a meal from scratch or tidying up any clutter you may have at home to give yourself some fresh space whatever occurs you from your experiences now imagine that same event but change it slightly such as if you were obliged to do those things that you didn t want to or that you were doing it to get something or that you were possessed by the urge to buy it when you really didn t need it what has changed did the feeling stay the same or did it become slightly tainted and quality or value is lost this merely is a practical reflection or test you can do to test the above sections for yourself the goal now is to learn when you are being manipulated or greedy and so be able make a stand to say thanks but no thanks this isn t easy but you have to ask yourself if the small unpleasant feeling of saying no is more or less than the price paid for saying yes this is hard because many cases exist where a person is manipulated by their close friends and family but are afraid they will end up alone as they don t have anyone else on one hand its certain that this is a low quality life essentially being used as a doormat on the other it is not unreasonable for the person to want to tolerate it for the sake of keeping the relationships this simply is the cost that must be paid for the association as it is beware of the extremes in order to best make changes in your life to give the most benefit as the mind is inclined to extreme sides dancing from one to the other there is a lot of various ways this may manifest but some common options to consider are it is possible a person may suddenly feel horrified at all the misery misfortunes manipulation and exploitation in this life and want to get as far away as possible from it whether they run away from people or take their own life as it is a central part of ordinary human interaction it can t be avoided without becoming an recluse and that can make us cold and lonely when we shun others diving in and sacrificing everything for others may make us vulnerable for the times when things don t go to plan we can easily be hurt far more by being too generous dedicating your life trying to change people as it is an effective method after all only until a person realizes they are being exploited will they know so any extreme response leads into horror or misery so less quality of life people are resistant to change from outside few will understand and even those that do are unlikely to implement difficult change the only way to handle it is make a choice to let go and do what you feel is right taking one or several aspects too seriously or personally this is what leads us to harm things that when wisely considered are rich in value become meaningless or even obstacles to achieve our desires try to find ways to improve the quality of your life and make it fun without their being a harm factor once you feel comfortable in saying no or yes according to the event see what you can do to make life more interesting and better quality this might be to learn something new change bad habits do something for yourself or other people without obligation while keeping a balance so you aren t becoming another doormat then you are a free agent because you have the choice to be it is important to accept that life is not easy nor that it owes us a living we do not have complete will power to achieve everything our willpower is naturally limited by accepting our limitations and accepting that dis satisfaction is therefore inevitable or unavoidable in life we no longer will be that effected or hurt when it does happen this two way system on letting go of the dissatisfaction as well as implementing ways to improve what we experience is dependent on understanding how the dis satisfaction arises in the first place once that ignorance has been penetrated then it no longer is a demon in the closest or monster under the bed because it has been understood for what it is,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to explore and understand virtue,virtue is the bedrock of religions philosophies cultures and nations yet there is more to virtue that meets the eye and often it is when we don t understand it that we can the opposite of what we imagine virtue to be why is virtue so important to our way of life what is the dark side of virtue and what can we do about it this tutorial will help you explore virtue and answer these key questions,consider the purpose of virtue mundane virtue is a system in which an interaction be formed on a single basic level this is often represented in relationships between three main groups social such as between our friends family neighbours and all acquaintances as well as environment legal such as our relationships with local government and community as well as state national and international laws and personal spiritual cohesion this covers all individual aspects such as our relationship with our physical health and well being as well as mental or spiritual health basic examples include for social interactions of not stealing from your friends or lying to your family or co workers legal may include not exceeding the safety speed limit while driving or vandalism up to criminal activity and higher international laws and personal includes eating healthily and maintaining a healthy home as well as practicing acts that may be seen as mental or spiritual such as forgiveness generosity and practicing things such as meditation vegetarianism etc in essence virtue in a cultural sense is about social interaction and the harmony of society transcendent virtue on the other hand is a more subtle variation which requires a depth of insight to be able to discern between ordinary and true virtue that leads towards personal harmony consider some of the paradoxes of mundane virtue in times of war it is seen as virtuous to defend ones country and fight ones enemies yet this will in some contexts contradict legal but consistently contradict moral virtue meanwhile to be pacifist in war supports moral or spiritual virtue yet may contradict legal and will often be portrayed as cowardice or treachery in social virtue teetotalism the abstaining from alcohol can be socially contradictory and isolating while is neutral or positive in legal contexts and is positive in spiritual and health virtue mundane virtue therefore is not clean cut and what may be virtuous to one may be non virtuous to another especially acts of schadenfreude some virtues also change in context so there is never a clean cut way to be perfectly virtuous it is very important to reflect that true virtue is always within the moment and that there is no genuine set standard of degree of virtue except when a person retrospects or abstracts a cultural system protecting the environment on one hand is virtuous but when it affects people livelihoods it is socially inappropriate as well as virtuous at the same time psychologically transcendent virtue is also complex all humans beings have the ability to love and hate to be generous and selfish and to to be wise or ignorant in this itself lies a complex paradox when we are deemed to be naturally good or inherently corrupt when we assume our inner nature is divine or perfect it can on one hand lead us to aspire to live up to this ideal which is a good thing but will also be a consistent problem psychologically whenever our dark side shows itself which leads to fear paranoia depression and other complexities for transcendent virtue to be natural it is to be aware that we have the proportionate capacity for both good and bad outcomes so while we have the capacity to love all beings infinitely it exists because infinite hate also exists it is all down to personal choice and awareness of that choice as well as the event itself mundane virtue focuses on personal conditioning which is the training we have had from our parents friends and teachers about how to behave explore cultural variations on virtue this is a vast area of study but can give very interesting insights for example some cultures forbid the consumption of pork yet others do not it is useful to understand the foundation or cause of the law as that way you can understand that all virtue is built on reason and cause and effect dynamics the usefulness of this is that it becomes quite easy to discern between mundane and transcendent virtue mundane virtue tends to vary and is subject to social pressures and personal interpretation where transcendent virtue tends to be universal contemplate on the changing nature of mundane virtue some virtues have stayed steady for millenia yet some are only relatively recent such as international trade laws as well as those dealing with technology virtue arguably reflects what is appropriate for the age the complication with this is ancient laws and means of dealing with crimes such as those only a few hundred years ago such deportation for those caught stealing food and more ancient ones authorising the use of torture to extract confessions some scholars have been known to imply a metaphorical context to ancient laws so that they are more socially acceptable in modern times the value of this helps a person to distinguish between mundane virtue which only helps us so far to develop as human beings as well as transcendent virtue which is timeless and natural contemplate on the personal merits of transcendent virtue a central factor to the benefits of being virtuous is a degree of trust a person has with themselves as well as others who are wise or intellectual will trust such a person virtue is often the foundation of society not just because of cohesion value but because it gives a definite quality of life wisdom in essence is the product of virtue as is developing mental health skills such as letting go thinking creatively and being humane to oneself and others virtue effectively brings a personal freedom that is unexpected from what sounds a very limiting lifestyle many communities and religions such as buddhist monasteries tend to be happy places as there is an appropriate balance with virtue wisdom routine and order as well as mental health and physical health development such as contributing and playing an active role which bring happiness societies that tend to favour only certain aspects tend to live less fulfilled lives explore what the world may be like without virtue as we know it this in itself it s a mind puzzle because what is virtuous in one context is not necessarily virtuous in another so its recommended to consider the implications of a mind that does not have the limitations of such an upbringing is there a sense of natural virtue is the world complete anarchy or does it no longer matter most people will settle on at least one of these outcomes if not others so its very useful to explore other possible outcomes this can include multiple variables for a basic example one may say it is virtuous to act first and apologise after if needed which is stronger in social virtue than the other two where another would say be humble and think first act later which is stronger in the legal virtue both can apply in personal virtue depending on the context a person who lives in the moment however arguably does not belong to either schools as wisdom guides their virtue consider ways mundane virtue can be manipulated there are really more ways than can be listed where virtue can be put off course its generally all about priorities and priorities are always linked to our wants and needs but virtue is more concerned ultimately with personal negligence suicide generally is seen as immoral yet willingly dying to save another only varies by intention and motivation a key area to explore is that politically we are frequently manipulated through applying to one of our concepts of virtue to choose something we may not have chosen had we been more wise to what was going on this is most frequent in advertising such as being socially virtuous to buy certain products or voting on political parties even when candidate or policy is not particularly wise yet it is by the the use of manipulating virtue and that the voter themselves are perceptible that elections can be won or lost likewise when individuals indulge in our own desires fears and ignorance which can make us deeply unhappy and insecure with ourselves we may also manipulate ourselves to believe that we were just virtuous or right to act as we see fit where many if not most wars and genocides have been stated by its propagators as virtuous and just actions start to consider how you can apply virtue wisely in this context wisdom must reflect on the outcome of the action and the goal is to be wise virtuous but not negligent when people as individuals have the ability to move towards skillful or unskillful actions it is we as individuals who ultimately choose to act even when it does not seem that way was the action praised by the wise and innocent did it improve our well being and mental health or did it lead us to remorse or other misfortunes many philosophers and great thinkers have said that the greatest gift person could have is good virtuous friends those who we can trust we can share and learn with and to support each other in their life journey it is always useful to explore virtue to understand how and why it exists as well as how it can make the world a better place,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to investigate the feeling aggregate,there are five aggregates materiality feeling perception formations and consciousness central to the path of developing understanding is investigating all of the aggregates here are some recommendations to investigating the second one in depth,take some time and find some space if you are just starting to practice this subject once you ve been doing it a while you can do it anywhere and anytime firstly break down feelings into groups of 5 3 3 feeling luckily is much more limited in scope compared to the materiality aggregate the first group to look for is the group of 5 these are pleasant physical feelings unpleasant physical feelings pleasant mental feelings unpleasant mental feelings equanimity feelings try to classify each feeling as it comes the point behind this is not only will you know them when they happen but you are far more connected in order to develop or let go of each type it also has the big advantage that you can know when the mind is playing tricks on you saying this or that is pleasant when in reality parts of the brain are stressing out the way to do that is just to watch them not only see how they change or react to various things but keep an important eye on collective feelings is there tension at seeing something is there a pleasant sensation at seeing something and so on through the senses touch taste sight smell etc examine the next group of three these are desirable so you would want more of them or the ones you have to stay forever etc undesirable so you don t want them to come and the ones you have to go away neutral feelings again try to classify them into these groups you might be surprised to see that you might desire getting angry when parts of the mind are showing the whole anger experience is really pretty unpleasant you can gain some real insights in doing this as pleasant and desirable can make a common pair but so does unpleasant and desirable and vice versa undesirable and pleasant and so on consider this is important just because you are the one involved in these contradictions are your feelings leading you into potential traps investigate the final group which is probably the most important profitable beneficial or skillful or whatever word works for you unprofitable harmful or unskillful indeterminate think about these some of them are tricky because what is pleasant and desirable is not always beneficial to you or others that s the big catch the only way to work out which is which is to watch and examine each feeling as it comes examine your feelings and these groups carefully it might sound crazy that your mind would want to have anything to do with harmful or undesirable feelings but it does it all the time because it has been let run wild and no one has been watching it to pull it back into line this can actually reveal the whole purpose and method of buddhism to develop the mind in order to let go of stress to develop a lifestyle in order to avoid stress and to develop skillful actions that don t result in stress then you are free,Philosophy-and-Religion

some of the more common talking points in christian apologetics these include arguments like the fine tuned universe which argues that our universe supports life so well and works in such a precise way that it must have been intelligently designed this argument directly challenges our science based understanding of the origins of the universe some may also argue that atheism is unscientific because of the belief that in the beginning non matter created matter they may say that this has never been observed tested or repeated therefore some will argue that an ultimate creator is needed to fix this dilemma another argument pascal s wager is the suggestion that one should live their life under the assumption that god does exist given that the stakes are skewed if god does not exist your life simply ends however if god does exist how you behaved in life determines whether you will be rewarded eternally in heaven or punished eternally in hell this argument though steeped in logic raises questions of honesty morality and the extent of god s powers 3 x research source examine your own myths urban legends and superstitions learn why people believe stories backed by anecdotal evidence understanding something about belief as it pertains to psychology will better prepare you for counter arguments and why you may feel the way you do about your own beliefs urban myths such as

first this sidesteps any feelings that you may be attacking their belief system with an agenda remain calm firm and reasonable a common stereotype of atheists is that they are angry and hostile explain why you are an atheist and what that means to you the goal of conversation is to wipe away preconceived notions about one another s beliefs for example you could say i believe that people have the ability to identify and choose right from wrong by experiencing life on their own you might also say people are wildly complex and interesting i believe they can make mistakes but also learn from them without needing to be policed ask questions about their beliefs why do they hold a particular belief sometimes pointing out a single fallacy every now and then is sufficient ask them to explain something about their religion you don t understand to help you to think about deeper meaning you might ask your friend how can god allow some in the world to starve and others to eat you might also ask i m interested in what christians think of the fact that the bible was written by several individuals is it difficult to trust in so many differing accounts suggest your friend start questioning

individual s hard work that paved the way you might tell them congratulations all of that studying really paid off avoid logical fallacies both sides of any debate will often create incorrect argumentation and rely on rhetoric without even noticing common informal fallacies in debate include circular reasoning which begins and ends an argument with the same idea for example the bible makes no false claims whatever the bible says is true thus the bible contains only truth the second and third portions of the argument are the same concept and thus not an argument of merit 6 x research

individual for example if your friend is falling behind at school i feel you i had a hard time dealing with all that homework too have you looked into study groups i joined one with my classmates and we ended up finishing the homework in half the time in times of your friend s lack of confidence you might offer when i feel down i always think to this great buddhist quote you can explore the universe looking for somebody who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself and you will not find that person anywhere know when to back away do not let differences and debate cause the end of a friendship know when to drop the conversation don t raise your voice a raised voice often indicates or leads to anger which can throw the discussion off track if your friend begins to raise their voice ease off of the conversation avoid physicality a discussion that turns physical is no longer a discussion if you or your friend start getting pushy end the conversation and put

how to channel,with practice channeling transmissions from the unseen world of the subconscious can be a moving and powerful experience whether you want to deepen your insight into your own nature or you want to reach outward for communications from beyond you can learn to limit the scope of your investigation achieve a trance like state and locate a guide to aid you in your journey helping keep that journey safe and productive see step 1 for more information,decide between exploring your consciousness and communing with the spirit world different traditions use the word channeling in different ways some channelers aim outward in an attempt to contact others or inward to learn more about the self depending on your interests and goals this decision can lead you into very different traditions rituals and practices though most types of channeling involve a similar process first inducing of a trance like state and then communicating with some other in supernatural or spirit channeling the goal is to tap into the world of spirits and communicate with them practitioners often want to contact deceased relatives or famous historical figures or otherwise make some contact with the dead spirit channeling as we think of it today with crystal balls and ouija boards was extremely popular in intellectual occult circles in the mid to late 19th century though this kind of for profit mediumship is widely dismissed by scientific skeptics as an orchestrated con against the often wealthy participants spirit channeling has historical roots that extend far beyond the victorian stereotypes consciousness channeling is a newer phenomenon in some new age philosophies practitioners of channeling will meditate and attempt to visualize archetypal figures that are manifestations of their own subconscious past life figures or metaphorical representatives of some psychological trauma this figure will often guide the participant through different interactions and communications with the aim of healing the spirit and learning about the self be open to wrestling with strange phenomena whether you want to find comfort and understanding by consulting an oracle or you seek a deepened understanding of life and death it s important to articulate your goals for channeling and be realistic about them if you re going to embark on a channeling journey it s important to commit to an often quizzical mysterious way of interpreting the messages you receive the better you are at receiving them the more you ll get out of the experience embrace the mystery of it anyone who s ever cracked open an iching or tried to learn about tarot knows that channeling can be a frustrating and complex process it doesn t always work like a movie where a candle flickers and you hear the voice of some long dead relative have a specific inquiry in mind a specific thing you want to learn and accept that you might not get the answer you re looking for take it seriously if your goal is get out a ouija board and ask a ghost what afterlife farts smell like you should probably spend your time doing something more constructive channeling only works if the participant is fully committed and open to the possibility of learning something about yourself and consciousness that might be hard to believe or understand read up on occult symbology and symbolism because the process often involves the interpretation of symbols it s important to do a little research before you jump in head first to get more out of the experience joseph campbell s the hero with a thousand faces and the occult by colin wilson are excellent primers to the ideas and images you ll need to be familiar with james merrill s modern verse epic the changing light at sandover chronicles his communications with a spirit named ephraim ask a very specific question all methods of channeling require that you have a very specific inquiry in mind for your spirit guide or your own subconscious it s unlikely that any spirit guides internal or external will come forth to answer a question that s unserious dishonest or trivial so give some thought to an appropriate question that deserves a complicated answer make it specific but not too specific a question like does bill really hate me when i show up late for work is probably better saved for a magic 8 ball you want your query to be broad enough to allow for complexity and personal enough to be worthwhile how can i be a better person in my work is more like it let one question lead to another if you re concerned about your work persona let that question spiral into more questions so you may look for possible answers in your investigation who am i when i work what does my work mean to me how should i approach my work what is a worker these may all be applicable questions that circle around your initial one look for the answers to questions you didn t ask start keeping a dream journal as you embark on a journey into your mind you may find it more and more difficult to distinguish between the dream state and your waking life symbols will surround you and will pop up at unexpected times this is a good thing you just need to be ready to capture them for further analysis later making a dream journal or a channeling journal an excellent resource for your investigation keep a small composition book beside your bed when you wake from any dream however boring or uneventful write down everything you remember from it immediately what did you see what did you feel who was there this kind of interpretation and attention to detail will serve you well in your channeling experiments meditate deeply focusing on your breathing find a quiet meditative location where you ll feel comfortable and calm settle into a comfortable sitting position on the floor or in a straight backed chair and sit with your body upright your back straight go with soft natural lighting and silence close your eyes or focus somewhere in the middle distance a blank wall or a calming spot would do nicely articulate your intentions for this meditation by centering yourself around some mantra like i will achieve trance and i will return to normal consciousness with a full memory of what i experienced i will achieve a deeper and deeper trance state with practice you don t need to sit in the lotus position in the middle of a crossroads at midnight or prostrate yourself in front of a goat skull and candles to channel focus on your comfort and achieving the trance like state not superficial details from the movies focus on your breathing sit quietly and breathe deeply feel your breath go into and out of your body feel the air going into your lungs filling you with nourishing oxygen and going out into the world breathe in and breathe out do nothing but breathe for several minutes let thoughts come and go focusing on none of them just focus on breathing use the power of suggestion to slow your body s rhythms to move deeper into a trance start with a specific part of your body like your left hand as you breathe feel the air coming into your body in your left hand move your consciousness into your left hand and focus your energy on relaxing your left hand say my left hand is relaxing my left hand is relaxed move the relaxation to your left arm then your right hand your right arm and your legs in the same fashion spend 30 60 seconds on each part of your body focusing your full consciousness and attention on relaxation wait until you feel that part of your body relax before moving on after you ve relaxed your body give weight to your body after you ve relaxed your body you want to introduce a feeling of heaviness as if your body were covered in many blankets or buried in sand in the same fashion establish a consciousness connection with your left hand focusing your energy into it fully it should still be relaxed say my left hand is heavy spend 30 60 seconds focusing on each part of your body in the same way after you ve given weight to your body give warmth to your body in the same way move around your body giving warmth by saying my left hand is warm focus your energy on achieving a state of warmth as if you were in a warm bath or had placed a heating pad on each part of your body your body should feel extreme comfort but you should not feel sleepy end each trance meditation slowly when you decide to return to normal consciousness focus on your fingers and your toes wiggling them and returning them to a more normal state feel your body gradually cool down and look around the room letting your mind return to its normal way of thinking stand up and walk around when you ve stretched out a bit don t just jump up and start pacing around if you ve been sitting long enough you might have sleepy limbs and could sprain an ankle bad juju for consciousness meditation gradually deepen your trance by practicing the goal of the trance is to blur the lines between your body your consciousness and the world around you move through the stages described in the previous step achieving the trance slowly focusing on calming your body practice introducing your body to the trance like state with many days of practice before attempting to deepen your trance or channel in any way this is a process you must commit to if you want to achieve results it may be slow going at first but as you progress you might notice the previous steps becoming easier and easier if you focus on warming up your left hand you may feel your left arm become warm at the same time or both arms become warm this is a good sign that your training your mind and body to achieve a trance state more quickly when you think you re ready to move on to a deeper state of consciousness add another step to your trance feel your forehead grow cool in many traditions the third eye located on the forehead signifies your connection to the subconscious or the world of the unseen isolate that part of your body by saying my forehead feels cool test the strength of your consciousness if you want to start seeing results and get some sense of how strong your connection with the world of the unseen has become try an experiment select a very specific time that you d like to wake up and plant the seed of that time into your mind at the end of your trance meditation after cooling your third eye focus on the time you ve selected by saying i will rise tomorrow at 6 00 don t set an alarm and try sleeping as normally practice visualization after much practice in achieving your trance state you should start to feel more comfortable moving into and out of that state if you ve grown quite strong it s time to start spending more time exploring it this is the beginning of real channeling before you find a guide or source to transmit to you though spend some time working on visualization and finding a deeper more immersive layer of consciousness visualize objects and colors after you ve cooled your third eye let your subconscious suggest a color say i see blue and repeat it until the color settles into your mind and you really see blue at first you may see a mishmash of colors but continue practicing until you can settle and see what your mind tells you to see it may be helpful to give the color an object like a pen or a car see the blue pen watch it feel it s weight in your hand and try to use it spend time visualizing many colors and objects before moving on visualize yourself falling deeper different mediums or channelers use a variety of exercises to fall deeper and allow the subconscious to take over this is an important way of getting more in touch with the world of the unseen and can be quite exhilarating when you re emerge from your trance state fall from a ladder into space visualize yourself climbing a ladder in darkness your body should be warm and comfortable climb the ladder for a while and then let go of the ladder feel yourself falling away if you become dizzy or disoriented focus on your body consciousness until you regain comfort and warmth take an elevator down some practitioners find success visualizing an elevator that s traveling down the wall of an endless rock face imagine an elevator with a glass door that allows you to see out on three sides there is darkness but on one side there is a rocky cliff with crags and tiny imperfections visualize them as closely as possible and continue traveling down ever farther personalize your fall there s no right way to visualize so do what feels comfortable for you some channelers like to visualize themselves as a falling feather a ring of smoke or as climbing down a long rope 1 x research source stop controlling your visualizations as you progress in your trance meditation you may find that you have more and more difficulty controlling your visualizations and that they re happening without your ability to stop them let this happen this is a sign that you ve moved deep enough to find a guide for your investigations this is channeling different traditions think about this state of being in different ways if you want to refer to this as going clear or entering the spirit world you re right on all counts you don t have to put a name on it necessarily but feel free to call it what you want visualize a location after you ve fallen from the ladder of yourself or otherwise descended deeper into your consciousness via trance meditation settle yourself in some comfortable location spend time exploring it see as many of the tactile details as possible in this waking dream focus your energy on inhabiting that space and really being there in some new age traditions it s suggested that you fill your location with all manner of esoteric crystals and golden cushions while other traditions may suggest you imagine a mossy wood straight out of tolkien go for it there s no right place let people come into the location visualize a person you know and watch their behavior as they come into your place let them be and observe them and their behavior if your subconscious suggests people that you don t know or don t recognize be especially conscious of them and remember their faces and their movements you know you re knocking on the door of channeling when you can start interacting with people you don t know pay particularly close attention to movements that people make things they may say or other imagery when you emerge from your trance write these details down immediately things that may not make sense to you in the moment will probably be often and will require analysis and consideration later that s channeling again if you want to think of these figures as dimensional archetypes or angels or the voice of your dna that s fine pick the symbolic representation that makes the most sense to you and listen to what the figures have to say for themselves it s not a matter of right or wrong when you re dealing with the subconscious and the unseen find a figure that s willing to speak with you increasingly you may notice the figures in your channeling approach you it may happen right away or it may take a very long time let them approach you and interact with them speak with them come clean with your intentions tell the figure why you re here and what you re looking for ask the figure if they ve got your best interest at heart and if they re willing to guide you in your investigation if they cannot ask the figure to leave and continue your practice establish a mutual agreement ask them the question or central issue that you ve been meditating on or allow them to show you what they wish to show you together decide how you ll communicate let the guide do their job guiding you don t do anything you re uncomfortable with but let the guide take charge of showing you what you want to learn look for symbols and archetypes to interpret your questions may already be answered and it s your job to pay attention to what you re being shown the more time you spend investigating common symbols of the occult and learning what you can about archetypal representation the more significant your subconscious observations and communications will become it may be largely visual 2 x research source if your location is suddenly filled with scuttling lobsters and lions with their heads on backward unbidden you may come out of your trance and think whoa trippy but don t let it drop just there lobsters appear on the tarot card for the moon signifying lunar energy and the subconscious while the lion appears on the card for strength significant you decide use the ouija board if you ve found a guide to the spirit world or the center of your own consciousness after deep meditation and practice you may want to find more direct and simple methods of communicating with that world without meditating for hours or end and seeking them the ouija allows for quick communication and transmitting this is also an excellent way of bringing other parties into your investigation introducing them to your guide and allowing a mutual discourse to take place meditate on your specific inquiry or question articulating your intentions aloud and allowing your contact to get in touch all parties should place their hands on the planchette at the center of the board then allow it to move and spell out the answers to your questions experiment with scrying sciomancy and other methods of divination over the centuries experienced mediums have experimented with lots of different methods of communicating with their spirit guides by manipulating objects including the use of crystals rocks smoke and even bones there are hundreds of different methods to choose from and your spirit guide may even suggest a preferred method of communication capnomancy refers to consulting the patterns of moving smoke to interpret the messages of the spirit world burn some sage or jasmine laurel leaves or sacred incense depending on your tradition and interests and observe the smoke as part of your meditations let symbols reveal themselves sciomancy is the study of shadows and shades for symbols headless shadows are generally interpreted as ominous though the spookiness shouldn t keep you away from this communication method make a candle a part of your meditation and observe the shadows cast in the room on the walls for symbols or messages to appear scrying is the technical term for gazing into a crystal ball and looking for prophecies or symbols you don t need to have an expensive ball of crystal to practicing scrying however it s also common to gaze into bowls of water mirrors or other reflective transparent surfaces try evp trumpet channeling or other sound methods if you re more interested in hearing the sounds produced by the spirit world sound capture methods of communication may be more appropriate for your investigations in trumpet channeling a phenomenon called direct voice phenomenon is the desired result of the consultation the trumpet is basically a cone made of aluminum a foot or two long and used to transmit the ectoplasmic vibrations of the spirit guide 3 x research source in electronic voice phenomenon evp you can record on a digital recorder or tape recorder the white noise of the room while you ask the questions of your spirit guide that you want to ask wait quietly and listen closely to your recording to see if inaudible responses were captured on the tape experiment with automatic writing for some participants especially those interested in plumbing the depths of their consciousness experimenting with automatic writing is an effective way of communicating with the unknown start with your trance meditation and move to writing in response to your queries all you ve got to do is get out a pen and a piece of paper and write unconsciously without pausing or paying attention to the words you re writing this is an excellent way of getting in touch with your own messages and reinforcing the agency and divinity of the self you ve got your own answers and can get in touch with them via automatic writing it s also effective to write down all your communications with your spirit guide after extracting yourself from your trance state it s important to keep a record of these communications to allow yourself to investigate them later for parallels and symbolic echoes consider letting chance affect your query tarot and iching consultation are formalized methods of questioning and answering that give up the agency of the answer to chance depending on how you choose to think about it devote yourself to it and prepare for it this can work alongside or as an alternative to more complex consciousness channeling the tarot doesn t require a complicated guidebook or method to start using get a deck and spend time analyzing each card giving it weight draw cards and let your initial gut reaction to the card clue you into its symbolic meaning this can be an excellent way of having your queries addressed consult the iching for anecdotal responses using three coins you can create a hexagram six broken and unbroken lines that corresponds to a particular symbol and entry in the iching called the book of changes with each hexagram is a brief symbolic anecdote which can be read as a metaphorical response to the question you re meditating on cleanse yourself for reception before the channel opens depending on your interests and your tradition you may find it necessary to chakra cleanse thoroughly prior to channeling as a way of balancing and cleansing your energy pathways on the other hand you might find it more effective to pray recite a mantra or otherwise center yourself physically and emotionally however you choose to cleanse yourself for your investigations make sure that you establish a mutual understanding and respect with your spirit guide it s extremely important to establish boundaries and articulate your desires develop an intense personal relationship with the source spend a considerable amount of time in trance meditation developing your relationship with your guide before you start demanding the answers to life s mysteries this may involve picturing the source as a person or presence with a name image or voice if it hasn t already appeared to you as such if you believe the source is within you this may involve becoming more aware of yourself and your thoughts feelings and habits end each session on a positive note thank your guide for their assistance and their guidance offering respect and appreciation try not to end it in frustration or anger record everything make the transmissions public by writing or otherwise recording your sessions with your guide this both serves to distance the transmission from your psyche and readies you to receive the next message keep the communication flowing through you not sticking around and gunking up your subconscious,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to practice humility,mother theresa once said humility is the mother of all virtues purity charity and obedience it is in being humble that our love becomes real devoted and ardent these words ring true but you don t have to be mother theresa or even religious at all to make an effort to practice humility in your everyday life being humble means accepting your limitations and making an effort to make the world a better place without wanting to take all the credit,don t think you re too good for everything you do people who have big egos tend to think that they deserve to be working at a better place to be dating someone better or even to be hanging out with people who are interesting and cooler but your life is your life and if you want better things then you have to work to reach for them instead of assuming the attitude that you re not getting treated fairly to practice humility work to accept the life you have while striving for more without complaining if you adopt the attitude that you re too cool for school people will become allergic to you instead work to be grateful for what you have and work to earn more if that s what you want be an optimist people who practice humility are naturally optimistic because they don t waste their time complaining about all of the bad things that have happened to them or dreading the future instead they re grateful what they have and they expect good things to happen in the future humble people don t expect to be given good things on a silver platter but they do believe that good things will happen to them if they work hard enough work on being excited about all of the things the future holds instead of expecting catastrophe to strike at any moment though it s a good idea to be prepared for the worst you should work on finding the silver lining in almost every situation accept that you re not the best at everything to get in a more humble mindset you have to accept the fact that you re not the best at everything or even anything no matter how great you are at surfing singing or writing fiction there will always be someone who is more knowledgeable than you are and that s okay instead of acting like you have the final say on something be open to the fact that you re constantly evolving and improving and know that other people can help you get there if you act like you re the best at something you ll come off as arrogant instead show people that while you re proud of what you know or what you can achieve you re always wanting to do more know that humility is not false modesty it s one thing to be humble and another thing to be falsely modest if you spent all weekend working on a project for work and your boss tells you you did a great job on monday don t say it was nothing tell him that you re glad he liked it and that you re happy to have put a lot of work into it you may think that shrugging off your achievements will make you look more modest but in reality it will actually make you come off as more arrogant 1 x research source sure it can be kind of awkward when people are praising you however you should accept credit where credit is due instead of acting like it was no big deal recognize your flaws if you want to practice humility then you have to be aware of the fact that you re not perfect if you think that you re a flawless human being then you re not going to learn anything new in this world or grow as a person instead it s important to be self aware and to know what you need to work on so you can be humbled before others a truly humble person knows that he has things to work on and makes an effort to get there sure it can be humbling to admit that you need to work on your social skills or that you re not the world s neatest person but this can also lead you to work toward self improvement along with recognizing your flaws it s important to be able to accept the things you cannot change about yourself avoid bragging to truly practice humility you should avoid bragging or showing off as much as you can while you may want to talk about your accomplishments you should avoid sounding like you re showing off as much as possible if you worked hard to do something then you can talk about it but avoid talking about how rich attractive or successful you are or people are likely to get the wrong impression about you instead you should trust the fact that if you re a really impressive person other people will get a sense of it without you having to tell them people who truly practice humility focus much more on praising other people than on focusing on their own accomplishments the next time you catch yourself talking about something you ve achieved ask yourself whether you re bragging or showing off or just sharing something you re truly proud of be grateful for what you have and what you don t if you really want to practice humility then you have to work on being grateful for everything the world has given you from your health to your pet kitty don t take anything for granted and know that it s a privilege to even be reading an article online you should also be grateful for the hardships and challenges you ve faced because they ve made you into the person you are today 2 x research source of course some people are a lot better off than others when it comes to the luck game just know that it s what you do with your luck that matters and that you should be grateful for what you have been given instead of complaining about what you don t have gratitude is essential for true humility work on making a list of everything you re grateful for and add to it whenever you think of something else stop talking one way to practice humility is to spend more time listening than you do talking if you spend all of your time talking about yourself or sharing your ideas then you ll be less likely to learn from others or to appreciate what they have to offer listening to other people will also make them feel important and cared for and it can be very humbling to give others a listening ear and a bit of your time it can be very humbling to realize that other people have a perspective that is just as valid as yours and that everyone around is also filled with worries doubts and hopes become an expert at listening to people without interrupting them or giving them advice unless they ask for it give other people credit if you want to practice humility then the best thing you can do is to is to learn to give credit where it is due if you re praised for doing a report at work make sure you mention that you couldn t have done it without two of your coworkers if you re praised for scoring a goal at the soccer game mention that you couldn t have done it without your teammates you are rarely responsible for 100 of your success and it s important to take the time to acknowledge all of the other people who made your success possible it will actually make you feel better to acknowledge that other people have worked hard too if you take all the credit without deserving it then you ll be practicing selfishness instead of gratitude admit when you re wrong one characteristic of a truly humble person is the ability to admit you re wrong if you ve made a mistake it can be very humbling to let people know that you re aware of your missteps and that you re apologetic about them don t just be in denial or brush it under the rug if you want to practice humility then you have to accept that you re not perfect and come to terms with admitting your mistakes and apologizing for them when you apologize to people look them in the eyes make your words genuine and show them that the behavior won t happen again let them see that you re taking the time to truly apologize and that you re not just doing it out of obligation of course actions speak louder than words to truly be forgiven you have to work to not make the same mistake again go last whether you re ordering at a family dinner in line at the movies or waiting to catch the bus make an effort to let other people go before you once in a while people who practice humility are aware that they re not the most important people in the world and they let other people go before them because they know that their time isn t more important than anyone else s while you shouldn t be a pushover you should look for opportunities to let people go ahead of you if you want to practice humility there s a real humility in saying after you work on seeing that your time isn t worth more than anyone else s and letting other people have a chance before you do it goes without saying that cutting a line is the opposite of being humble ask for advice it can be very humbling to admit that you don t have all the answers and to defer to someone else when something is troubling or puzzling to you take the time to turn to a friend for advice or to ask a coworker to share his expertise be comfortable with admitting that other people have something that is useful to you and that you re always open to learning more and improving as a person truly humble people know that knowledge is infinite and they re always asking others to share what they know don t be afraid to admit that you don t know something in fact most people love sharing their knowledge with others and will be eager to help you you can even offer a bit of praise when you ask for advice just saying something like hey i know you re a whiz at math and i just can t understand this problem will make a person feel great as long as it doesn t sound like you re sucking up praise others another way to practice humility is to recognize other people for their achievements praise other people as much as you can for being in awe of how hard your co worker worked on a presentation to praising your sister for keeping her head up in a difficult situation praising others publicly as long as you don t embarrass them can also be a great way to show your appreciation of others and to humble yourself before the strengths of other people get in the habit of telling other people when they re doing great at something this can make both you and the person feel great of course make sure the praise is deserved you don t want the person to think that you just want something from him give compliments if you want to practice humility then you should always be open to complimenting other people from telling them how great they look to complimenting aspects of their personality as long as your compliments are genuine you ll be making other people feel better about themselves while practicing humility in the process truly humble people recognize that other people have endless qualities that are worth praising even something simple like i love your earrings they make your eyes stand out can really brighten a person s day and it takes very little effort volunteer if you make volunteering a part of your routine then you will be able to have a more humility filled life whether

compare yourself to others to practice gratitude on a regular basis you should avoid comparing yourself to others whether you re jealous of your neighbors your best friend or even taylor swift focus

better because of them but if you covet what they have you are likely to fall into feelings of bitterness that will keep you from enjoying your life don t gossip about people or put them down because you re secretly jealous of them either humble people only say nice things about people behind their backs be teachable people who practice humility are the first to admit that they don t know everything whether you re getting tips from a co worker or a friend it s important to be open to new possibilities and new knowledge let people see that you think they have a lot to offer you and

solved the big problems that you seek instead focus on stilling yourself and increasing your awareness then taking that into the world to start meditating learn to still your thoughts and watch them float through your mind without identifying them actively just sit focus on your breathing and fix your gaze on the void try to hold onto your meditation mind for as long as possible throughout the day notice the little things slow down abandon needless beliefs a popular zen saying compares zen to a boat you use when you need to cross the river but you don t take it with you learn to leave your zen on the shore when it becomes unnecessary religion meditative practices and other aspects of your mystical experience should serve your understanding of the world not burden it surround yourself with mystical people it s important to spend time with like minded believers who take their mystical practice seriously learn by observing and having complicated conversations with people from your church organization or other religious groups bounce ideas and interpretations off each other learn as much as you can in some traditions finding a teacher mentor or guru is an essential part of practicing your own brand of mysticism and developing as a mystical thinker if you re ready to pledge yourself to a serious practice consider finding a personal teacher,Philosophy-and-Religion

it most people will die within three days 5 x research source fasting can take many forms and you might allow yourself to drink water throughout your fast but some fasts the islamic fast for the month

deficiency by super hydrating beforehand drink plenty of water regularly in the days leading up to your fast then drink at least two quarts of hydrating fluids before the last meal preceding your fast also avoid dehydrating foods with high salt and sugar contents like fast food or salty snacks limit your caffeine intake coffee soda tea and all those energy drinks we drink on a daily basis all contain high amounts of caffeine though you may not think of it this way caffeine is considered a mood altering substance that can result in dependence if not outright addiction if you drink caffeine

empty stomach making your head spin and potentially making you feel nauseous it poses serious health risks tobacco use during a fast elevates both blood pressure and pulse rate and decreases the skin temperature in your fingers and toes 8 x research source if you re having trouble finding a way to quit even temporarily talk to your doctor to learn more effective strategies eat carbohydrate rich

stuffing yourself regularly before your fast will acclimate your body to large meals you ll feel even hungrier when you stop eating it may also help to vary your mealtimes so your body doesn t continue to anticipate food at specific times of the day eat a large meal before the fast but don t overeat many people choose to eat a large protein filled meal for their last meal before the fast after days of eating small carbohydrate rich meals this last meal can make you feel more satisfied for a longer period of time and ease you into the fast remember to take in a lot of hydrating fluids before your final meal to help your body get through your fast keep yourself busy hunger is a full body primal feeling and can take over your mind if you let it obsessing over your hunger is the quickest way to letting yourself break your fast distract yourself by keeping yourself busy whenever possible distract yourself with light pleasant activities like talking with friends or reading a good book you can also take this time to catch up on chores and errands you otherwise put off when you re trying to keep your mind off hunger vacuuming the whole house might not seem so bad if you re

you are doing an intermittent fast in which you regularly fast every few days for short periods of time you are most likely trying to lose weight when you exercise a carbohydrate depleted body it begins burning fat to fuel itself which may be your goal note though that it will also begin burning through protein and muscle mass your best bet is to exercise at a low rate instead of running yourself breathless during cardio avoid high energy activities if you re on a long term fast people on an intermittent fast only fast for short periods of time although they should do less cardio they can still exercise because they ll refuel their bodies soon however if you re planning to fast for a few days or more it s best not to engage in high energy activities they will tire you out far more than they would when you were eating regularly if you re fasting over a long period of time rather than intermittently you won t be able to refuel your body for some time get plenty of rest you may feel relaxed while you sleep but your body is hard at work taking care of itself when you re knocked out it gives your body time to repair muscles form memories and regulate both growth and appetite through hormones 11 x research source when you re fasting you may find it harder to concentrate from the lack of food regular naps taken during the day have been shown to improve alertness refocus the mind and improve moods 12 x research source make sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep every night and nap regularly throughout the day spend time with other people who are fasting those who are

detoxification try to find a friend who will fast with you to keep you company being around someone who s going through the same thing will keep you from feeling alone in the experience hold each other accountable and motivate each other to reach your goals whatever they may be avoid talking about food don t put yourself in situations where you ll let yourself feel sorry for yourself even if you re around other people who are going through the fast with you don t let the conversation turn to all the foods you miss eating you ll obsess over it long after the conversation is over and you may let yourself cheat when you re alone instead of talking about what you re missing out on frame your conversations around the positives what are you getting out of this or talk about something completely different like the movie you just saw or a recent event in the news until your fast is over politely decline invitations to meals with non fasting friends even if it doesn t tempt you into breaking your fast watching other people eat will be a miserable experience keep a fasting journal even if you have an accountability partner who s helping you stick to your fast you may find yourself frustrated in ways you don t want to share with others keeping a journal to hold your private thoughts is a great way to both vent and record your experience for later insight you can treat it like a normal diary about day to day life or focus it only on fast related topics either way your fast will likely find its way into your private thoughts don t censor yourself even if you re fasting for religious reasons don t feel bad about questioning whether you want to finish the fast just writing it down will help you confront the feeling then flush it out of your system have a plan for breaking your fast no matter how hungry you are at the end of your fast you have to fight the urge to stuff yourself at your first opportunity when you fast your body adjusts to make up for the lack of food by

this situation for several minutes ask aloud or in your mind for a direct intuitive experience about it in the near future let it go you may need to do this multiple times before anything comes of it but by focusing your energy on one specific situation your intuition is more likely to pick up on cues for that situation than on anything else work on your indirect intuition indirect intuition also called symbolic intuition focuses on the mind s natural ability to pick up on things of key importance by developing your ability to see in and interpret mental symbols grab a pencil and a piece of paper ask yourself what does my life need right now repeat this question three times pausing in between each repetition while imagining yourself moving to a more meaningful answer each time after asking the question three times pick up your pencil and draw the first symbol that comes to mind interpret the symbol figure out what it represents from your perspective and how that concept plays

from external stimuli that your subconscious has already analyzed 2 x research source before going to sleep put a pad of paper and a pen next to your bed ask yourself a question or focus on a specific situation in your life that you need an intuitive answer to repeat it as often as possible before falling asleep when you wake up write down anything you dreamed about if you did not dream about

energy and subconsciously answer questions using your intuition 3 x research source sit down at a desk with three blank cards think about a question or situation you need your intuition to help you with write three different solutions to that question assigning one to each card flip the cards over so that the answers face down shuffle them and place them face down on the desk run your hands over the cards take your time relax and breathe deeply flip the cards over the card you felt most drawn to should be the correct solution release your fears most instructors who teach psychic development will say that the biggest obstacle you need to overcome when becoming clairvoyant is the fear you have regarding the ability to see the future identify the source of your fear oftentimes your fear may be as simple as worrying about how silly you look but sometimes you might have a frightening image at a young age and turn off your clairvoyant abilities in response get rid of your fear by chanting an affirmative phrase silently or out loud try a phrase like i am willing to release all fear of seeing my future increase your visual imagination before you can use clairvoyance to answer direct specific questions you may need to increase your ability to see vivid images in your mind you can do this with a simple visualization exercise imagine yourself holding seven balloons each balloon should be a different color let the balloons go one by one watch each one float up to the blue sky until they disappear before releasing the next balloon and visualizing the same thing practice until you can clearly see each balloon complete its journey form a specific question when the time comes to use your clairvoyance on a particular question make sure to phrase your question in a very specific manner so that you can really address the heart of the matter stay away from a broad question like will i enjoy my birthday this year in this instance think about what you actually want your birthday to be like and ask yourself a more specific question like will any of my friends or family take me out to do something special for my birthday this year open your third eye after asking your question breathe deeply three times focus on the area between your eyes this spot is a chakra known as a third eye which psychics claim to be responsible for visual clairvoyance abilities continue breathing while fixing your attention on this area vividly imagine an illuminated horizontal oval shape in the center of your forehead this is your third eye ask it to open repeating the request until it does and you feel a warm feeling rush through your body let pictures come to you naturally let the images come into your mind naturally do not force them if they seem fuzzy or unclear tell them aloud or silently to grow in size and strength right away clairvoyant images will usually come as a picture inside your mind s eye a picture seen outside of the mind s eye a movie inside your head or a movie outside your head the images may be black and white or full color moreover they many appear life like or cartoonish if you cannot figure out what your clairvoyant images mean ask aloud or silently what do these pictures mean you should receive an answer as a feeling thought or sound if this does not work repeat the exercise until some answer does come when you just start out the answer may seem hazy and uncertain but it is important that you trust yourself no matter what know the difference between each type when people think of psychic abilities and predicting the future they often think only of clairvoyance clairvoyance is the practice of future sight but there are other senses you can use to anticipate the future clairaudience is the ability to hear psychic energy clairsentience is the ability to feel energy common forms of clairsentience include gut feelings and empathy claircognizance is the ability to know things without being told if you ever had a grandmother or aunt who knew whenever anyone was sick at your house without being told about it first she would have possessed claircognizant abilities develop clairaudience by focusing sound in your imagination to develop clairaudience you need to learn how to fine tune your sensitivity to the sounds around you and inside you when lying in bed at night consciously listen to the noises you usually tune out separate and identify each one pick out as many as possible before falling asleep and do this for about a week listen for clairaudient guidance picture yourself turning on a radio and tuning to your clairaudient channel start asking questions and listen for any words you get in response these words may be soft or loud sensible or confusing but once you hear a response you need to analyze what it means work on clairsentience by focusing on another s energy one of the most beneficial ways to develop clairsentience is to work on reading the energy and feelings of someone else you can practice this in several ways ask a friend to show you a picture of someone you do not know but whom he or she knows well look at the eyes of the person in the picture and try to determine how that person felt at the time the photo was taken also ask yourself if this person is trustworthy and if there is anything else that stands out check with your friend to determine how accurate your senses were ask a friend to give you an object belonging to someone you do not know but whom he or she knows well this object should be something the person has worn regularly since these objects are more likely to absorb more energy hold the object in your hands and gauge whether there more positive or negative energy has soaked into it develop claircognizance with automatic writing exercises developing your claircognizance is a lot like developing your intuition you will need to focus on exercises that help you organize your thoughts and understandings like automatic writing sit down with a pen and paper ask yourself a question and write down whatever pops into your mind in response even if it seems like unrelated nonsense force your mind to be a spectator in this exercise do not let your mind think about the information you get or try to direct it simply write your thoughts as they roll out until they cease to come read over what you wrote if anything jumps out at you highlight it and analyze it after you finish reading your entire thought process keep a journal whether you are trying to develop intuition clairvoyance clairaudience clairsentience or claircognizance tracking your psychic experiences in a journal can help you develop your abilities further keeping a journal helps you understand your strongest psychic and intuitive abilities it also lets you check for accuracy and assess how valuable your responses tend to be 4 x trustworthy source university of minnesota earl e bakken center for spirituality healing interdisciplinary health center focused on conducting research and providing interprofessional education related to health and wellness go to source find an intuition buddy even if no one among your friends and relatives is working on developing clairvoyance you should have at least one person whom you can openly express your thoughts to sharing your experiences can help sharpen your understanding of them share entries from your

work chances are you ll reach your goal in time 21 x research source remember a setback isn t necessarily a dead end so don t give up just because things don t go right the first

how to understand syllogisms,a syllogism is a logical argument composed of three parts the major premise the minor premise and the conclusion inferred from the premises syllogisms make statements that are generally true in a particular situation in doing so syllogisms often provide for both compelling literature and rhetoric as well as irrefutable argumentation 1 x research source syllogisms are an integral component of the formal study of logic and are commonly featured in aptitude tests meant to assess logical reasoning abilities,recognize how a syllogism makes an argument to understand syllogisms you need to familiarize yourself with several terms often used when discussing formal logic at the most basic level a syllogism is the simplest sequence of a combination of logical premises that lead to a conclusion a premise is a proposition that is used as evidence in an argument a conclusion is asserted by the logical result of an argument based on the relationship of the stated premises 2 x research source consider the conclusion of a syllogism to be the thesis of an argument in other words the conclusion is the point proven by the premises determine the three parts of a syllogism recall that a syllogism includes a major premise a minor premise and a conclusion jumping into an example all humans are mortal might function as a major premise and would stand as a generally accepted fact david foster wallace is a human might follow as a minor premise 3 x research source notice that the minor premise is more specific and immediately relates to the major premise if each of the prior statements are considered valid the logical conclusion would be david foster wallace is mortal determine the minor and major terms both the minor and major premises of a syllogism must have one term in common with the conclusion the term that is in both the major premise and the conclusion is the major term which forms the predicate of the conclusion in other words it states something about the subject of the conclusion the term shared by the minor premise and the conclusion is the minor term which will be the subject of the conclusion 4 x research source consider the example all birds are animals turkey vultures are bird all turkey vultures are animals here animal is the major term as it is in both the major premise and is the predicate of the conclusion turkey vulture is the minor term as it is in the minor premise and is the subject of the conclusion notice that there is also a categorical term shared by the two premises in this case bird this is called the middle term and is of immense importance in determining the figure of the syllogism which is addressed in a later step look for categorical terms if you re preparing for a logical reasoning test or simply want to better understand syllogisms in general note that most syllogism you will encounter will be categorical this means that they will rely on reasoning akin to if ____ are are not members of a category then ____ are are not also members of that category a different category another way to think of the logical sequence employed by categorical syllogisms is that they all employ the logical sequence of some all no _____ is isn t ______ understand the distribution of terms in a syllogism there are four different types of propositions that can be made by each of the three parts of a syllogism think of how they differ in terms of how they each distribute or don t distribute any categorical term consider a categorical terms to be distributed only if all individual members of that category are accounted for in the term for example in the premise all men are mortal the term men is distributed as every member belonging to that category is accounted for in this case as mortal note how each of the four different types of propositions distributes or does not distribute the terms in all x are y propositions the subject x is distributed in no x are y propositions both the subject x and the predicate y are distributed in some x are y propositions neither the subject nor the predicate are distributed in some x are not y propositions the predicate y is distributed identify an enthymeme enthymemes aside from having another really hard to pronounce name are simply compressed syllogisms another way to think of an enthymeme is as a one sentence syllogism which may help you recognize both how and why syllogisms are a convenient reasoning device 5 x research source in specific terms enthymemes disregard the major premise and combine the minor premise with the conclusion for instance consider the syllogism all dogs are canine lola is a dog lola is a canine the enthymeme of this same logical sequence would be lola is a canine because she s a dog another example of an enthymeme is david foster wallace is mortal because he is human distinguish between validity and soundness a logically valid syllogism is one in which the premises entail the conclusion in that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false however it is possible for a valid syllogism to be factually untrue if its premises are false this is called an unsound syllogism sound syllogisms are valid syllogisms with true premises a sound syllogism is truth preserving where true propositions entail a true conclusion 6 x research source for instance consider the syllogism all dogs can fly fido is a dog fido can fly this syllogism is logically valid but since the major premise is untrue the conclusion is clearly inaccurate and the syllogism is unsound the structure of the argument made by a syllogism the reasoning of the argument itself is what you re assessing when assessing a syllogism for logical validity when assessing soundness you re assessing both its validity and the factual accuracy of its premises look for linguistic giveaways that indicate invalidity observe the affirmative or negative nature of the premises and conclusion when looking to determine validity note that if either of the premises is negative the conclusion must also be negative if both premises are affirmative the conclusion must also be affirmative if any of these rules are not followed you already know the syllogism is invalid further at least one of a syllogism s two premises must be affirmative as no valid conclusion can follow from two negative premises for example no pencils are cats some cats are not pets therefore some pets are not pencils has true premises and a true conclusion but is invalid because of its two negative premises if transposed it would reach the nonsensical conclusion that some pets are pencils further at least one premise of a valid syllogism must contain a universal form if both premises are particular then no valid conclusion can follow for example some cats are black and some black things are tables are both particular propositions so it cannot follow that some cats are tables you ll often simply know that a syllogism that breaks one of these rules is invalid without thinking about it as it will likely sound illogical be skeptical of conditional syllogisms conditional syllogisms are hypothetical and their conclusions are not always valid as they depend on the condition that an unproven premise is true conditional syllogisms will include reasoning along the lines of if_____ then_____ these syllogisms are not valid when there are additional factors that may contribute to a conclusion for instance if you keep eating jolly ranchers every day you re putting yourself at risk for diabetes sterling doesn t eat jolly ranchers every day sterling is not at risk for diabetes this syllogism is not valid for several reasons among them sterling may eat copious amounts of jolly ranchers several days a week just not every day which would still place him at risk for diabetes or sterling may eat cake every day which would definitely place him at risk for diabetes watch out for syllogistic fallacies syllogisms can allow for incorrect conclusions to be implied by a false argument consider the example jesus walked on water the green basilisk lizard walks on water the green basilisk lizard is jesus this conclusion is not necessarily true as the middle term in this case the ability to walk on water is not distributed in the conclusion 7 x research source as another example all dogs love food and john loves food does not logically indicate that john is a dog these are called fallacies of the undistributed middle wherein a term that links the two phrases is never fully distributed beware of the fallacy of the illicit major too for instance consider all cats are animals no dogs are cats no dogs are animals this is invalid because the major term animals is undistributed in the major premise not all animals are cats but the conclusion relies on this insinuation the same may be said of an illicit minor for instance all cats are mammals all cats are animals all animals are mammals this is invalid because again not all animals are cats and the conclusion relies on this invalid insinuation recognize types of propositions if each of a syllogism s premises are accepted as valid the conclusion may also be valid logical validity however also depends on the form and figure of the syllogism which both depend on the propositions of the syllogism in categorical syllogisms four different types of propositions are used to make up the premises and the conclusion a propositions propose a universal affirmative such as all categorical or specific term are a different categorical or specific term for example all cats are felines e propositions propose exactly the opposite a universal negative for instance no categorical of specific term are a different categorical or specific term more demonstratively no dogs are felines i propositions include a particular affirmative qualification in reference to one of the terms in the premise for instance some cats are black o propositions are the opposite including a particular negative qualification for instance some cats are not black identify the mood of a syllogism based on its propositions by identifying which of the four types of propositions are used we can reduce a syllogism to three letters to help determine whether it s a valid form for the figure of that particular syllogism different figures of syllogisms will be described in a following step for now simply understand that you can label each part of syllogism including each premise and the conclusion according to which type of proposition they make to identify the syllogism s mood for instance consider a categorical syllogism with the mood of aaa all x are y all y are z so all x are z a mood refers only to the types of propositions employed in a syllogism of standard order major premise minor premise conclusion and may be the same for two different forms based on the figure of the syllogisms in question determine the figure of the syllogism a syllogism s figure is determined by whether the middle term serves as subject or predicate in the premises recall that a subject is what the sentence is about and the predicate is a word that applies to the subject of the sentence 8 x research source in a first figure syllogism the middle term serves as subject in the major premise and predicate in the minor premise all birds are animals all parrots are birds all parrots are animals in a second figure syllogism the middle term serves as predicate in the major premise and predicate in the minor premise for instance no foxes are birds all parrots are birds no parrots are foxes in a third figure syllogism the middle term serves as subject in the major premise and subject in the minor premise for instance all birds are animals all birds are mortals some mortals are animals in a fourth figure syllogism the middle term serves as predicate in the major premise and subject in the minor premise for instance no birds are cows all cows are animals some animals are not birds recognize the valid forms of syllogisms although there are 256 mathematically possible forms of syllogisms since there are 4 possible variations a e i o for each part of a syllogism and 4 different figures of syllogisms only 19 forms are logically valid 9 x research source for first figure syllogisms the valid forms are aaa eae aii and eio for second figure syllogisms the valid forms are eae aee eio and aoo for third figure syllogisms the valid forms are aai iai aii eao oao and eio for fourth figure syllogisms the valid forms are aai aee iai eao and eio,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to change,change is inevitable in life but that does not need to be a bad thing a great man once said that in order to change anything you must first change yourself changing yourself takes time and dedication but you have the power to make yourself different if you are willing to work,know that all meaningful change must come from within if you don t trust yourself to change then no one will do it for you real change has to be driven from your own desire to be better feel better and have a positive outlook on life change can be scary but it you love and trust yourself you can get through changes unscathed think of prior big changes in your life are they really scary in hindsight how well did you handle the changes what can you learn from them practice positive affirmation a positive outlook on life and the future is paramount to enacting change you need to first change how you look at yourself before you can change think of it this way if you want to change your love life to become more open you re not going to get very far if you believe i don t deserve to be in love erase this negative language from your mind by practicing positive refrains every day like i love myself i can do this i am capable of changing 1 x research source don t punish yourself or get upset if you have a negative thought instead replace it with an opposing positive one if you thought women never like me counter it with i haven t met a woman who i am compatible with yet remember that as you change you re not necessarily becoming somebody completely new instead you re revealing other aspects of yourself 2 x expert source joui turandot branding consultant expert interview 4 june 2020 take care of your body and mind to make change easier even if your goals aren t related to your body being healthy and happy will make it much easier to focus on changing yourself for the better make sure that you are eating a balanced diet getting 6 7 hours of sleep a night and doing things you love to erase stress 3 x research source recognize the behaviors or thoughts that you want to change don t judge yourself or get upset at your faults this is the time to look at your behaviors through a neutral lens figuring out exactly what about yourself you want to change there is a reason you want to change and you need to do some exploring to find it having clear motivations will make it much easier to change some questions to ask include does this make me happy what are the facts not the feelings about this situation why do i want to change what is my end goal make a plan of action this needs to be specific and goal oriented by setting smaller more manageable goals you trick your brain into thinking the task is easier making it easier to commit to your project for example you might want to reform your love life and become less shy setting small goals makes the larger idea change your love life seem less daunting step 1 think about what you want in a partner what attracts you what doesn t make a list step 2 think about what caused relationships to fail in the past start going to the gym clean up your house or focus more on work to improve your chances at love step 3 commit to going out to bars and social events at least once a week or make an online dating profile step 4 ask one person out for a casual date no matter what the answer brush it off and keep trying start with small changes before tackling larger ones if you are trying to cut out junk food it will be incredibly hard to quit eating pizza soda cake candy and fast food all at once cut things out periodically which lets you enjoy your early accomplishments and slowly get used to big changes for example you might start by eliminating soda from your diet a week or two later cut out pizza then candy and so on it can help to make a schedule as this will keep you in check if you write down that you are quitting pizza on april 20th you are much more likely to actually quit than if you just say i ll quit eventually make up a mini quota for each day what is the minimum you need to do each day to make your change stick this is separate from the long term goals or plans because it puts you in a mindset every day to work towards your change if you want to reform your love life you might decide to have one extra conversation with a stranger each day whether on the bus or at work this allows you to practice your larger goal without stress or fear 4 x research source your quota can be low all it does is set the bar for you you might decide to do 10 push ups each day but nothing keeps you from doing 100 some days as well keep your plans to yourself this goes against conventional wisdom which often says that telling someone your goals makes you more likely to pursue them however study after study has found that people feel less motivated to work after announcing their plans because they feel slight satisfaction at making them 5 x research source the exception to this rule is when working with a group as working on a goal together frequently makes everyone work harder writing down your goals and motivation and keeping them to yourself is a great way to be public about your plans to change without sharing anything 6 x research source one fun simple exercise to do is to use a platform like pinterest to collect visual ideas of what you like or where you d like to be that way you ll have a record to look back on 7 x expert source joui turandot branding consultant expert interview 4 june 2020 simplify your life change is often about stripping away the things that are no longer relevant to your life this allows you to focus on what really matters putting your energy into things that make you happier and healthy take a long look at your life and think about what is non essential what activities do you do that make you constantly unhappy what projects or appointments do you put off for as long as possible is there any way to remove these stresses from your life 8 x research source think about little things first cleaning out your email inbox canceling you re the newspaper subscription you never read opening up your schedule etc you goal is to make more time in your life to focus on yourself using your new free time to change for the better be patient and know that change is not easy change takes time and if it didn t then everyone would be in constant flux you need to commit to your change for months to make sure it sticks know that you will falter slide back into your own ways and consider changing your mind this is only natural but quitting your reformation at the first sign of trouble will prevent you from ever really changing in order for your brain to develop strong new neural connections that last throughout your life you need to work on your change for up to 4 5 months 9 x research source keep you goal in mind when things get tough the amount of time needed to get there is not what is important the destination is form a group of friends around your new habits it is much easier to commit to a habit if you have someone willing to work with you you keep each other accountable remind each other of goals and support each other when things get tough if you cannot find someone to join you search online for support groups and communities there are forums and meetings for everyone and every habit from quitting drugs to working on your artwork once a week ask a buddy to quit smoking with you pick up an exercise partner to help motivate you at the gym commit to sending new chapters poems or ideas to a writing buddy once a week if some people seem skeptical about your transformation don t feel bad when you start stepping up your game people may feel self conscious that they re not stepping up in their own lives 10 x expert source joui turandot branding consultant expert interview 4 june 2020 work on your habit every single day there are some exceptions to this rule as you do not necessarily want to weight lift without having a rest day here and there still the more frequently you practice your habit they faster it will become an automatic part of your life find small ways to practice each day while you cannot lift weights every day you could still go to the gym and jog for 20 30 minutes to get some exercise this works for bad habits too but in reverse every day you succumb to your bad habit smoking eating junk food lying you make it harder to kick focus on avoiding temptation one day at a time practice your new activity or habit at the same time every day your body is an amazing thing when you repeat the same activity at the same time and or place every day your brain and body begin to anticipate it and prepare for the activity making it feel natural this sort of conditioning is invaluable to anyone trying to develop new habits and can be used anywhere when building habits routine is your friend schedule the same time to go to the gym each week set aside a room or desk to study or do work each evening link your habits into old routines instead of saying i will make my house cleaner you could say every day when i get home i will clean a room of the house this gives your habit a trigger every time you walk in the door you will remember to do some cleaning 11 x research source you can do this with bad habits too if you always smoke outside of the break room at work avoid going there so you don t feel tempted to light up a cigarette 12 x research source eliminate obstacles quitting smoking is a lot more difficult if you keep a pack of cigarettes in your back pocket similarly eating healthy is a lot easier if you have healthy options with you at lunch think about where in your thought process the habit breaks down think about ways to eliminate these hurdles for example you might get rid of your cigarettes pack a healthy lunch the night before work exercise after work instead of before so that you are not sweaty at your desk bring a pencil and paper with you everywhere to jot down ideas stories or art 13 x research source know that there is no magic number of days needed to ingrain a habit conventional wisdom holds that it takes 21 days to ingrain a habit but this is not true different habits take different people different amounts of time to pick up some researchers have found that habits only truly become automatic after 66 days not 21 14 x research source this means it is not your fault if you struggle to make something a habit but it also means that you must find the motivation to make a habit for much longer than 2 3 weeks don t fret if you miss a day or make a mistake you have 66 more to go so one day only makes a small difference focus on the end goal not the number of days it takes to reach it 15 x research source draft up a concrete image of what you want to become making a major life change from ending a long term relationship to switching careers is usually only terrifying because you don t know what is coming next that uncertainty can paralyze you if you don t take the time to figure out where exactly you are going you don t need to know everything no one ever could but you do need a vision for how you are going to change what do you want to eliminate from your life what do you want to add where do you see yourself 1 year after you ve made your change what do you want more than anything else to spend your time doing 16 x research source plan specific ways to change your lifestyle once you have a good idea of where you are going you need to figure out how to get there this is often the hardest part of changing but it becomes much easier if you think of it in reverse say your goal is to become a famous author to make this change a reality think of the steps that would lead to becoming a famous author until you get to one you can work on 17 x research source goal to be a famous author get a book published find a literary agent write and edit a book write every single day draft up ideas for books if you don t have an idea yet you would start here if you do it s time to write every day 18 x research source save up making a big change in life is a lot easier if you have a safety net to fall back on you re more likely to take a plunge when you know that failure doesn t mean the end of the world so save up a little extra money this will allow you to focus on changing your life not on paying the bills open a savings account and start putting in a small percentage 5 10 of your paycheck in it many financial advisors suggest having enough money to cover at least 6 months of living expenses before making a large change like a move or career change get educated you never want to make a major lifestyle change without some knowledge of what you are in for if you want to start a new career going back to school is often the best way to get on track as the specific knowledge will prepare you for a life in the field you desire even those looking for more off beat changes like traveling for a year or becoming an artist need to study to get the most of their lifestyle change look up autobiographies of similar people while you don t have to follow in their footsteps they offer valuable advice about what to expect as you change spend time researching your new change what kind of equipment do you need do you need to move locations what are the negatives of your new lifestyle and do they make you want to change any less get out of your old life quickly and respectfully once you ve made the decision to make a change and you are confident it s time to start you need to cut your old ties this does not mean that you will never see people from your old life again rather it means that you need to take some time away from the routines habits and lifestyle to truly change things never burn bridges with cruel goodbyes or anger instead let people know that you are ready for a change and would love their support as you go through with this work on making your new change a reality every day you need to commit to your new life fully if you ever expect to change sometimes this is easy if you want to travel for a year you need to get on a plane and get out of the country but sometimes this requires daily discipline no matter how you cut it for example you need to write every single day if you want to be a famous author remember change is about choice make the choices that bring about the change you desire 19 x research source,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to find your inner self,figuring out who you are and your place in the world is a life long task but it doesn t have to be scary or intimidating once you realize that finding yourself is an ongoing process not some sort of goal you must attain you ll realize that you know much more about your inner self than you ever imagined,think about the moments you are most proud of in your life finding meaning in your life is not easy nor should it be but you can get wonderful clues from your own past think about the things that brought your great pride in yourself as these are often the moments where you found the most meaning and purpose while working traveling or learning what makes these moments so special what challenged or excited you about the work what motivated you to succeed 1 x research source identify your values identifying your values is an important part of finding your inner self as you reflect on things that made you proud think about what these experiences reveal about your values try asking yourself what values are connected with the things that make me feel proud 2 x research source for example if you felt proud at your high school graduation then you might value education if you felt proud when you received a promotion at work then you might value professional achievement if you felt proud when you planned a surprise party for your mother then you might value family and doing nice things for other people start creating a list of all of your values you might even rank them in order of their importance to you determine the things you want in life finding your inner self is as much about looking forward as looking back whether it is a job a house in your favorite town a loving partner or lazy sundays with a book your desires reveal a lot about you simply jot down the things you want in life don t be shy and don t filter this list of things in any way which ones are you pursuing which ones have your forgotten about which ones matter most what kind of person do you imagine when looking at your own list of wants and priorities think about how you d spend your time if you had total freedom would you write the novel you always talk about or would you get to work constructing a patio would you travel the world or sit inside with a good movie if money wasn t an option would you grab the non profit job you ve always eyed or pursue an old hobby these ideas are not just fantasies they are a version of you unburdened by stress and logistics finding that version of yourself is the first step in making it a reality be specific in your thoughts imagining a full day in the life of your dreams these dreams aren t always easy to attain but that is okay the point is to become conscious of your hopes and goals as they reveal a lot about your priorities 3 x research source reconsider the facts ideas and outlooks you grew up with or take for granted a simple example is with food you may have detested pickles growing up only to find years later that they aren t so bad you often convince yourself things like i hate pickles i am a morning person i am good at math but bad at english when it is the thought alone not any real fact that makes this true whenever you re absolutely sure about some part of yourself flip the thought on its head before believing it do you believe it out of habit or because it is true people change and by firmly saying i am _______ you risk missing those changes within yourself more often than not these ideas are self fulfilling if you always tell yourself you are awkward on dates then any date you go on makes you nervous and self conscience this of course makes you more awkward 4 x research source dig beyond the simplistic labels given to you by others at any one time you may be considered a daughter a girlfriend an employee and a tennis player these labels are important to help define your roles and responsibilities in the world but they are not you they are just labels and you are far more complex and nuanced than a few words instead look beyond these labels at the concepts behind them if you see yourself as a daughter ask why that role is important to you is family an essential anchor in your life when stressed do you turn often to parents and relatives if you see yourself as a girlfriend ask yourself what your partner highlights or brings out in you remember that are not defined by romance but you can learn about yourself by growing intimate with someone if you see yourself as an employee ask where your personal goals or ideas meet with your company s they won t perfectly align and that s okay you are not just an employee if you see yourself as a tennis player ask yourself what goals or aspirations you have on the court what draws you to the sport 5 x research source consider taking an in depth personality test as a jumping off point personality tests like the psychologically based meyers briggs test are great places to ask good insightful questions about yourself they also provide broad but generally useful thoughts on how you handle stress relationships creativity and emotions they are not however perfect representations of your personality the important thing to remember is that they are jumping off points to understanding not the end of the road 6 x research source when you get test results ask yourself which parts ring true to you what parts surprise you most importantly what parts feel false or untrue and why you can find many of these tests online for free if you do prioritize tests that ask lots of questions at least thirty or more and compare the results of 2 3 tests to minimize mistakes meditate or spend 10 minutes each day in quiet reflection you re not going to find your inner self if you don t go looking for it meditation is not as difficult or complex as people claim as even sitting for a few minutes in a quiet room is a great way to tune into yourself remember that mediation is not an end but a mean meant to help you think about the difficult questions that you otherwise don t make time for if you re struggling to relax concentrate on your breathing where is it coming from how does your body react to inhalations and exhalations what is your natural rhythm if your thoughts are racing or you feel bored that s okay instead of feeling like you somehow failed ask yourself why you re feeling these things what in your life is taking up so much headspace 7 x research source remember that this is a life long process not an quickly accomplished goal understanding your inner self is a never ending process because you are always changing instead of viewing your inner self as something you find once and know forever you should always be looking inward to learn more about yourself as you life and surroundings change you do too don t close yourself off to these new realizations because you believe you know everything there is to know about yourself looking back on your life note how often you were wrong about yourself how often did your likes desires goals etc change as you grew older even if you re sure about yourself now this change will always happen as you move through life 8 x research source check in with yourself regularly checking in with yourself to see how you are feeling is a great way to stay tuned in to your thoughts and feelings try to check in with yourself once per day you can do this by following a simple pattern of questioning yourself and answering your questions 9 x research source what s wrong to this you might answer something like i am worried about my finances for this month because i had an expensive car repair to make what can i do to feel better about the situation to this you might respond i can use the emergency credit card if necessary however i will probably be able to get by without it if i can reduce sending in a few other areas this was a necessary repair so it is okay that i spent money on it what is going well in my life you might respond to this question by saying something like i have a nice home good friends and a fun job note goal progress and re evaluate your goals regularly successful and happy people do not just set out a path and blindly follow it just like your inner self matures and evolves your goals need care and attention as you grow too once a month or so ask yourself the following questions are my goals and priorities still the same are there any new ones what have i done to get closer to my goals how can i repeat that success what can i do in the next two weeks to actively pursue my goals stop trusting your internal critic so much many people are plagued daily by self doubts criticisms and worries this is natural but that doesn t mean you always need to listen to them when your brain tells you something is too hard that you might fail that you re unpopular whatever your stress is remember that this is not who you are your inner self is not a critic these are just anxieties and worries that you need to address ask yourself what emotion usually anger or fear is at the center of your unpleasant thoughts you can then confront these emotions instead of letting the thoughts circle your brain if you re struggling to get past this voice set a timer and indulge it for 5 minutes let yourself be worried scared or confused and when the timer is up move on 10 x research source surround yourself with other self aware people good friends make everything easier and finding people who are equally interested in being their best self will help you be yours try to avoid constantly negative people or those that refuse to think critically about themselves instead look for people who are pursuing personal goals talk honestly about themselves and their feelings look for the best in situations finding solutions instead of excuses 11 x research source learn to say no saying no especially to friends family and coworkers is difficult but necessary if you want to find your inner self this doesn t mean you should be selfish it just means to be confident in your ideas and decisions if something doesn t mesh with your idea of yourself trust yourself and turn the offer down pursuing a goal whether it is personal or professional requires some sacrifice but you can only choose what is important and what is less crucial once you start to find your inner self peer pressure isn t always obvious or cruel it might be fun for example to go out with your roommates instead of finishing work or relaxing but if you want or need to stay in it s okay to temporarily disappoint them they ll understand accept and embrace occasional contradictions ralph waldo emerson famously said that a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds what he means is that truly self aware people accept that their opinions and ideas can change and that is okay don t worry about appearing hypocritical the goal is to be honest and truthful to yourself in the present moment not to who you were yesterday or last year 12 x research source challenge yourself daily staying true to your inner self is not supposed to be easy through challenging yourself to reach difficult goals complete projects or just try something new you can break the rut you re in and further develop your skills even better the moments when you challenge yourself are often the most rewarding because they require you to learn or expose new parts of yourself this doesn t mean you must live a difficult life to know yourself it simply means you don t shy away from things you love or want because they are challenging do your research but trust your gut some people love to think about every possible outcome before they do something others will take a risk at the drop of a hat without any prior knowledge somewhere in the middle of these two extremes however is a healthy and productive philosophy once you ve reached a point where further research is just delaying a decision it s time to look inward and make a choice expose yourself to new ideas people and activities regularly when you re placed in unfamiliar circumstances whether it is a new country or a party full of strangers you remove the context and labels that once defined you you re free to be yourself and these new experiences will expose parts of yourself that never needed to come out in the past 13 x research source learn something every day even if it is small by broadening your understanding of the world around you you gain a greater context to examine yourself ask for guidance and advice from trusted mentors or role models finding your inner self is paradoxically not a solitary effort other people can illuminate parts of yourself that are difficult to see yourself helping shape your self understanding a good mentor will not tell you what to do or who to be but will instead help you find the answers yourself a mentor or role model is just someone whose opinion you trust and who you can talk openly and honestly to a mentor isn t someone who is right every time when asking advice remember that it is ultimately up to you whether or not to follow it,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to write a devotional,writing a devotional is a great way to share the insights and experiences you ve had throughout your christian walk when you write a devotional focus on one short passage often just one verse then engage the reader by connecting that verse to an anecdote or a personal interpretation of that verse and finish with a call to action once you re comfortable writing one devotional try compiling a collection of them to submit to a publisher,choose a market to submit to and follow their formatting guidelines read the submission guidelines for your favorite devotional magazine or website or search online for a list of current markets that accept devotional submissions each publisher s submission guidelines will typically include a word count stick to this as closely as possible the guidelines may also specify the basic format structure the publisher requires or the devotional style they prefer you might also need to tailor your devotional to the target audience for each publication 1 x research source for example you might choose a publisher who specializes in devotionals that are geared toward women and that are 150 250 words long when you re researching formatting guidelines look for a submission calendar for that publisher for instance the publisher may put out a series of devotionals on the book of psalms during the month of may although the deadline for that collection might be in february if the publisher is affiliated with a certain denomination you may need to take their particular tenets and beliefs into account while you re writing open with a scripture passage devotionals are often a study of just one verse from the bible although that may vary depending on the publisher you might choose a verse or passage that explains a biblical principle or you could opt for one that includes a detail that you can expand into a universal truth if you choose a passage that s longer than one verse try to include just the section that directly deals with the topic you ll be discussing 2 x research source different versions of the bible can have slightly different wording so be sure to double check that your verse is exactly the same as the version you cite 3 x research source if you re already working with a publisher they may provide you with the passage you could also choose a verse to fit a submission calendar or you could find a passage that you feel is appropriate for your chosen market s target audience for instance if you want to submit to a collection of devotionals centered on the book of psalms you might choose a verse like psalms 22 14 i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart has turned to wax it has melted within me use a story to engage the reader right away after you present your verse open your devotional with an engaging anecdote or a vivid picture of what s being described in the verse this might only be a few sentences long but it should catch the reader s attention right away 4 x research source don t be afraid to let your personality show readers will relate better to your devotionals if you re authentic 5 x research source for your devotional on psalms 22 14 for example you might share a personal example of a time you were grieving such as in the fall of 2012 i was a wreck i d just been fired from my first real job and then i got the call that my father had passed away he was my spiritual mentor and my best friend and i didn t know what i was going to do without him connect the story to your interpretation of the bible passage once you ve captured the reader s attention with a story draw a clear line between your illustration and the passage keep the focus narrow a devotional should focus on one main point of the verse rather than trying to explain the whole thing 6 x research source for instance you might connect your story of grief back to psalms 22 14 by saying something like i felt weak and empty as though my bones had slipped out of joint my heart had melted like wax and my emotions had all been poured out i felt like i wasn t in control of my body or my mind but in the middle of that haze something deep within me urged me to pray i don t think there were even words just a soul crying out to god king david felt similarly broken and defeated and yet his heart still called out for god relate the story back to a universal truth you don t want the focus of the devotional to just be on yourself even if you include a personal story in the passage try to include something relatable or universal so the reader can apply what they re reading to their own life like a general statement about love life or loss or a biblical truth about god s love or power 7 x research source in your devotional on psalms 22 14 you might say something like whether you re grieving a recent loss or there s an unhealed hurt in your past that you can t move past god s love is big enough to heal your pain conclude with a prayer and a call to action challenge the reader to do something to help bring them closer to their loved ones overcome an obstacle in their life or pray about a problem they re having then include a sample prayer they might say as they re meditating on their devotional for that day 8 x research source for example you might conclude your psalms devotion with something like try saying this prayer today dear lord please comfort my broken heart help me understand how to use this hurt for your glory and guide me as i try to figure out my path in jesus name amen pray before you write writing a devotional is an inherently spiritual process so don t just reduce it to word counts and catchy anecdotes before you write and throughout the process pray earnestly that god will guide you so you can share his truth in a way that glorifies him 9 x research source it may help to write your devotional after you ve done your own morning prayers and scripture reading try to focus on one aspect of the passage when you re choosing the topic for your devotional try not to let it become overly complicated it s easy to take a deep dive into theology but devotionals are meant to inspire the reader to meditate on some aspect of their own life 10 x research source if you narrow your focus it will also be easier to meet word count limits for instance if you re writing about john 15 13 which says greater love has no one than this to lay down one s life for one s friends you wouldn t write about all of the different types of love people have for each other instead you might write about the deep love shown when someone sacrifices themselves consider the market s target audience when you re writing the most effective devotionals are able to strike a balance between being very personal and universal to ensure you re able to craft a message that will really hit home with your reader think about who you re writing for and use stories examples and language that will apply to them for instance if you re writing about forgiveness and you re submitting to a market geared toward married christian couples you might write about forgiving your spouse however if the market is geared toward teens you might write about forgiving your friends parents or siblings instead write with a positive uplifting tone even if your devotionals are calling out a specific sin described in the bible it s important that you avoid having a judgmental tone or seeming like you re talking down to the reader instead try to write in a way that s relatable and encouraging and that always emphasizes god s love goodness and forgiveness 11 x research source for instance you wouldn t want to say you ve probably told a lie right that s a sin and everyone who sins is going to hell instead you might share a story about a time you told a lie to be polite then got caught avoid controversial topics sometimes theology can be a landmine full of differing opinions and interpretations of scripture with that in mind try to steer away from complex emotionally charged topics that are frequently a source of division instead try to focus on truths that anyone could apply to their own life regardless of their stance on morally ambiguous issues for instance it s best to avoid writing about politics sexuality free will vs predetermination or whether scripture is meant to be interpreted literally or as a metaphor you may need to take the publication s denominational affiliation into account when you re deciding whether a topic is controversial for instance many southern baptists frown on drinking any alcohol at all so it would be best to avoid writing about drinking in moderation if you were writing for a baptist devotional magazine if you do feel led to write about topics that are controversial within the church consider publishing them as blogs articles on christian websites or even in book form devotionals might not be the best fit for these subjects but that doesn t mean you shouldn t write about them at all study your bible each day sometimes you ll have an idea for a devotional and you ll need to find the right verse in your daily reading other times you ll read a verse that will spark the idea for an entry either way maintaining a vigilant daily bible study is essential if you want to have a fresh perspective on god s word 12 x research source read each passage carefully so you don t accidentally write a devotional with a verse that s taken out of context take a notebook with you everywhere you go when you re focused on applying biblical truths to real world dilemmas you ll likely start to come up with story ideas as you go about your day to day business to ensure you can jot ideas down as they come to you always carry a small notebook and a pen in your purse or pocket 13 x research source each night read through your notes and try to match them up with any verses that come to mind keep your entries consistent when you re compiling a collection of devotionals they should all be similar in length and tone it can also help to have an audience and their particular denomination in mind since this can help shape the focus of each entry 14 x research source for instance you might write a devotional book geared toward for teens new mothers busy professionals or people who are grieving choose a number of devotionals to coincide with a calendar for instance you might 30 devotionals so you have a month long study you could write 52 entries so you d have one entry a week for a year or you could write a year long daily devotional book with 365 entries 15 x research source if you re working with a publisher they may specify how many entries to include proofread your devotionals carefully once you ve finished writing your collection put them all aside for a week a month or longer then come back to them and read them carefully checking for spelling and grammatical errors as well as issues with tone and phrasing 16 x research source try reading each entry backward start with the last sentence and work your way to the first this proofreading trick can sometimes help you find errors you wouldn t otherwise it s often a good idea to ask someone else to help you proofread since they might catch errors that you won t see submit your collection to christian publishers when you re satisfied that your entries are ready for publication send your manuscript to your preferred publishers remember to always be professional courteous and prompt in any communication with your publishers 17 x research source even if your manuscript is accepted keep in mind that your collection will likely need to go through revisions with an editor be sure to carefully adhere to any deadlines and don t take any editing suggestions personally 18 x research

that affect our family other good questions to ask include what makes you most proud about our family or what do you look forward to when you come home you could also try what embarrasses you about our family and what does our family provide for you that you don t get from friends consider having each family member answer these questions individually then you can openly and honestly compare answers encourage your family members to ask questions too be thinking about how you re feeling as your family discusses these values this will increase your self awareness of what might be causing

indicate how they will stick to this value you could pledge to always drive the speed limit your daughter could promise to always wear a helmet when riding her bike make sure your children are involved treat defining your family values as a family decision if your children are a little older such as teenagers make sure they feel like they are an important part of the process say things such

declaration of the values you share as a family 6 x research source write down what the purpose of your family is and a strategy for making sure that you remain focused on that purpose try writing an

sticking to each of these values 7 x research source you can print the mission statement and have it framed having it hang in your home is a good way to remind each of you of what is truly important to your family think of your values daily take a few minutes every day to check in with yourself at the end of each day you can ask yourself questions try thinking how did my actions today relate to

know one another better this will help you figure out what matters most to each of you individually and as a family schedule time for the whole family to spend together it can be as simple as eating dinner together or something like devoting a whole saturday to family activities let each member of the family have input in your activities for example if your daughter loves to exercise try taking a

accomplishing those goals is learning one of your family values think about translating that into a concrete goal think about the steps you can take to focus on learning as a family for example you could all learn a new language together or take a cooking class this will integrate your family values and goals if financial responsibility is a family value you could use that guiding principle to make sure that each family member understands the importance of sticking to a budget that way you can accomplish family goals of saving for retirement college etc if resiliency is a family value you

how to deal with religious people if you are an atheist,if you are an atheist you ll come across your share of religious people who are genuinely curious about and respectful of your perspective even if they completely disagree with it you ll also encounter religious people who are ignorant about atheism eager to convert you to their truth and or hostile to your very presence many disagreements and arguments can be avoided through tact patience and common sense and when they can t or shouldn t be avoided a thoughtful and respectful approach can help prevent a contentious situation,don t bring up the subject unnecessarily you should never feel like you have to lie or pretend about what you believe or don t if you re asked about your religious beliefs be honest however you also don t need to be a walking advertisement for atheism at all times either if you re in a room full of believers think carefully before steering the conversation towards your lack of belief there s nothing wrong with sitting quietly sometimes and it never hurts to listen to others talk about what they believe we all have to sometimes listen to people talk about subjects we don t care for or don t understand hockey poetry auto repair or whatever it may be just sit it out and wait for the subject to change keep the focus on other topics instead of sitting back and hoping the conversation doesn t turn toward religion or waiting for it to pass on to another subject if it does you can work to steer the conversation towards topics that may be more comfortable for everyone involved consider the audience and bring up topics that are likely to be of general interest it may seem trite to discuss sports or the weather at thanksgiving dinner but it s probably preferable to a knock down drag out fight over deeply held religious beliefs even politics may be a less contentious topic to bring up for example if your religious friends start to discuss their church activities try saying that s great you re so involved in your church what other activities do you enjoy doing outside of church i ve been trying to find some new activities to do this is likely to shift the conversation to jet skiing stamp collecting volunteering at an animal shelter etc refrain respectfully or partially engage in prayers or religious rituals as an atheist there will be times when you will feel you need to stand up for what you believe be it the teaching of creationism in public schools or prayers before city council meetings it s okay to decide that every little thing isn t worth fighting for though like choosing to simply sit quietly during a prayer before a group meal you have to decide for yourself when to let things go 1 x research source if someone happens to complain that you aren t bowing your head during the prayer or showing the proper reverence in some other setting calmly offer to discuss the topic privately later if for instance you are at thanksgiving dinner and are asked to give some sort of blessing or say what you are thankful for you can do so without invoking any god or religion say something like i am thankful for the people who grew this food those who provided it and those who prepared it i am thankful that we can all be together now to enjoy it and each other s company spend time with other atheists while it s healthy instructive and usually necessary to spend a good bit of time around religious people it s also alright to seek out the comfort of being around others whose perspectives align more with your own with a little searching you ll probably find a welcoming community of fellow atheists atheists make up about 3 of the u s population however within your community it may seem as if you re alone particularly if you live in a small town try finding support online 2 x trustworthy source pew research center nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion demographic trends and social trends go to source check out the websites for american atheists american humanist association or similar groups in your area or nation they may have local get togethers or events 3 x research source 4 x research source stay calm and don t get defensive instead of reacting defensively when someone attacks your point of view take a moment to collect your thoughts determine what you want to say before you say it 5 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source remember you don t have to defend your point of view to anyone your views are equally right and important use i statements this will help to diffuse a potentially bad situation for example i am feeling attacked right now i would appreciate it if i could have a moment to collect my thoughts 6 x research source don t try to force your point of view on others even if you are resentful because you feel like religion is often forced upon you don t stoop to the same level if bullying tactics don t work in convincing you that you should be religious don t expect the reverse to work with others if you are resentful towards religion consider that much of your resentment probably stems from people attempting to force their beliefs on you think of how you d like to be treated if the situation was reversed allow others the opportunity to speak otherwise you ll come across as aggressive which will likely lead to conflict agree to disagree don t try to determine whose point of view is right especially when dealing with something as deeply personal as religious belief attempting to resolve who is right and who is wrong will only prove futile focus on explaining what you believe and why in a calm reasoned manner 7 x research source if you ve been going back and forth put an end to the conversation at least for the time being you may want to say it seems like we ve been going back and forth on this issue for awhile i respect your opinion and i hope you can respect mine but i think we should agree to disagree don t bring up the subject again unless there is new information to cover remember everyone regardless of their beliefs assumes they are right you re not going to convince someone otherwise in one conversation 8 x research source don t argue with someone trying to convert you to their religious beliefs having a lively discussion with someone who hopes to convert you can help to clarify your thoughts and learn more about others beliefs getting into a heated debate or outright argument with someone who is never going to budge however won t achieve anything positive give them an opportunity to speak once they have finished their thought thank them for their time give a measured calm response or none at all if you so choose if the person is a friend let them know you value their friendship but feel uncomfortable by them trying to convert you if they keep trying to convert you you may need to reconsider the friendship if the person shows up at your door don t just slam it in their face let them say what they came to say take any materials they offer you and thank them for their time walk away when a calm discussion is not possible if things get too heated simply walk away there is no shame in leaving a conversation that isn t going anywhere you can always choose to resume the discussion at another time if you choose but you need not do so if you see no point in trying again let them know you re ending the conversation you can say i am feeling disrespected right now and am going to take myself out of this situation walk away and give yourself some time to cool down if you think of another point you d like to make don t put yourself back into a bad situation send an email or ask if you can discuss the topic with the person at a later time do your homework it is very difficult for a constructive dialogue to take place if there is no common ground of understanding between the two parties before engaging in a conversation with a religious person educate yourself on the basics of their beliefs 9 x research source especially if you are very unfamiliar with the person s religion search online read articles consult books and consider taking a look at the faith s sacred text s this will help you better understand where the other person is coming from and will help you to generate questions about their faith 10 x research source it is completely fair for you to expect the same of the other person offer to recommend some key atheist works that speak to your point of view and ask the person to consult them to facilitate your discussion you can always delay and resume the conversation at another time 11 x research source define what atheism means to you before you can explain to others what it means to be an atheist you need to be able to explain it to yourself you don t have to use a textbook definition of atheism there is no single atheist view just as there is no single christian or hindu view come up with a definition that works for you 12 x research source before you begin the conversation ask if the person understands what an atheist is you may want to say i m looking forward to talking with you about atheism before we start why don t you tell me what you know about it if they don t know anything about atheism or assume that it means you believe in nothing or are satanic in some way don t criticize them for it instead quickly provide them with some basic information about atheism you can start the conversation by saying why don t i tell you a little bit more about atheism so you know where i m coming from if necessary provide some source recommendations for the other person to consult and request that you resume the conversation at another time ask questions and listen to answers with curiosity and respect make an effort to understand the other point of view by listening and asking questions this will show that you are engaged in the discussion if you don t have specific questions ask open ended ones such as tell me more about your beliefs or how did you come to believe what you do listen when they respond make eye contact and focus on what the person is saying now is not the time to be planning your next question or trying to look up something on your phone 13 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source don t ask questions that are purposely leading and antagonistic for example refrain from saying something like what makes you think your religion is so much better than others instead try asking what aspects of your religion set it apart from others this is a nicer way of asking the same question avoid taking cheap shots you may think the other person s belief system is ridiculous but offering ridicule will get you nowhere positive just because you may have read somewhere that there is a negative correlation between iq and religiosity that is that less intelligent people tend to be more religious doesn t mean you should make generalized assumptions or critical remarks about the other person being foolish or delusional offer respect if you want to be given respect 14 x research source steer clear of open ended or hostile questions that won t move the conversation along for example refrain from asking why are christians so crazy you re not only generalizing but you re backing the person into a corner as they couldn t possibly begin to answer your question don t blame the person for all the evils you believe have been done in the name of that religion you don t want to be blamed for all the evils done by those who rejected religion do you you can ask however how their religion reconciles evil acts done under the guise of the faith be open to learning something new don t just say you re open to learning something new mean what you say in learning more about other faiths you ll only broaden your own worldview if your beliefs will be threatened by knowledge then maybe they ought to be reconsidered anyway an atheist should be someone who is open to asking questions and seeking answers like a good scientist an atheist should never be afraid of being proven wrong truth should be your ultimate goal 15 x research source if the person invites you to a religious service agree to go as a respectful observer you don t have to convert to their religion or share their beliefs but you will certainly learn something new you in turn can invite them to a gathering of others like

make unto thee any graven image they may allow you to take pictures of their buggy or farms if you ask politely however 3 x research source be aware that some may not feel comfortable especially women with talking to outsiders extensively about their faith or lifestyle since they are taught to be modest in everything they do decide if you still wish to join after visiting one or several communities you need to decide which community you would like to join once you have developed a short list of about 3 to 5 communities you should begin contacting the leading bishop of each community to gauge whether you would be welcome to join their church finding the leading bishop should not be too difficult if the community is on your short list you have probably already visited it and hopefully developed some contacts there who can help you although the amish do not have any rules forbidding outsiders from joining it is highly unusual and typically not encouraged so contacting the bishop is a good way to judge what the community s reaction to a newcomer is likely to be 4 x research source if the bishop is open to the idea of you joining their community he will invite you for an interview where you can put forward your reasons for wanting to become a member of the amish you will need to demonstrate the strength of your faith your willingness to renounce the ways of the modern world and your commitment to the amish way of life as long as your motives are pure and you are fully aware of what life in an amish community entails there should be no objection to you coming to live in the community move into an amish community once you have made your decision and you have received the bishop s permission you may begin your new life as a member of the amish you will first be placed with an amish family where you can learn their ways and participate in the household duties during this time you must prove yourself to the amish by living according to their religious principles and becoming a productive and valuable member of the community once you have done this there is no set time period you may be voted into the church and become a true member of the amish community unless you are coming from another branch of the anabaptist church with a very similar lifestyle you are likely to find the transition to amish living somewhat difficult living without electricity cell phones and motor vehicles is a lot harder for someone who is used to having these luxuries than it is for people who were brought up in the amish community and don t know any differently although some amish may be very welcoming and helpful to you as you make your transition others may be more distrustful of you and not expect you to last very long give them time once you prove your faith and commitment they will grow to trust and accept you purchase a house and some farmland if possible once you have been voted into the church and no longer need to live with a host family you may look for a place of your own most amish live in farmhouses surrounded by land that can be used for growing crops and raising animals as the amish try to be as self sufficient as possible unfortunately available farmland is becoming harder to find due to urban sprawl high demand for land from an ever growing amish community even though new people rarely join the average amish family has seven children and prohibitively high costs 5 x research source you will also need to keep in mind that your home will need to be close enough to the center of the community that it can be reached by horse

amish community it is the main language spoken in the home and at church although amish children do learn to speak english in school pennsylvania dutch is primarily a spoken language with no standardized form of writing or spelling and must be learned to become fully immersed in the amish community as a newcomer to the amish community learning to speak the new language will be difficult but not impossible you will pick it up just by listening to others attending church services and by making an effort to speak it whenever you get the opportunity it may also be possible to hire a pennsylvania dutch tutor who can help you to improve at a faster pace 6 x research source the term pennsylvania dutch is a misnomer as the language has no association with the netherlands it is in

language 7 x research source learn to live without modern comforts the amish aim to live a life of simplicity unfettered by the materialistic trappings of the modern world however learning to live without modern comforts can be quite a challenge for people who haven t been brought up in the amish way 8 x research source learning to live without electricity which the amish consider to be worldly and unnecessary will perhaps be the greatest challenge of all depending on the strictness of the amish community you have joined your new home may or may not have running water if it does not you will need to use an old fashioned hand pump instead some homes will use natural gas to provide heat and light whereas others will use wood or coal fueled stoves telephones are not allowed in most amish households though some communities will allow for a shared phone to be installed in a shack or outhouse which can be used by several families whenever necessary get a horse and buggy in addition to restrictions on electricity and modern plumbing systems the amish forbid ownership of motor cars this is because amish communities thrive on being close knit and mutually dependent a motor car would make cities and other english communities much more accessible and may tempt the amish to leave their faith and families behind they also believe that having a motor car might inspire feelings of pride in its owner and pride is considered to be a serious sin as a result amish communities use a horse and buggy for transport which is sufficient for covering the distance required to get to church visit neighbors and make the trip to amish supply stores consult with your neighbors on where you can get a horse and buggy of your very own while they can t own or drive a car the amish are willing to accept rides and even hire drivers if a necessary trip must be made to visit far flung relatives receive medical treatment or procure supplies unavailable in amish stores learn to dress appropriately the amish style of dress is very distinctive and must be strictly adhered to by both men and women clothes must be plain and unadorned in solid dark colors made from simple durable fabrics the simplicity of dress is meant to reflect the amish way of life which is practical and unmaterialistic vanity or the concept of taking pride in one s appearance is forbidden in amish culture men should wear straight cut suits without pockets collars or belts which women should wear high necked long sleeved full skirted dresses covered by an apron any form of patterned fabric ornamentation or jewellery is not permitted men should remain clean shaven until after marriage when they are required to let their beard grow mustaches are not permitted and haircuts can only be given by amish barbers women must wear their hair in a braid or bun which is then covered by a prayer covering which is a symbol of their subjection to god 9 x research source avoid being photographed amish people will avoid having their picture taken whenever possible this is because they believe that photographs are a form of graven image which is forbidden by the bible they also believe that having photographs of themselves may inspire vanity which is forbidden and considered a sin there are however some exceptions to this rule some amish will allow themselves to be photographed as long as their hands or hats cover their faces others are okay with being filmed or photographed as long as they are shot in a natural setting where it s clear that they are not posing for the camera participate in a barn raising barn raisings are an integral part of amish tradition they represent some of the most important amish cultural values acting selflessly and working together for the good of the

rituals they live by the biblical instruction be not conformed to this world romans 12 2 which informs their practice of living humbly separate from the modern world two of their most important abiding principles are those of demut which means humility and gelassenheit which entails calmness gentleness and surrendering yourself to god s will 11 x research source the amish place great importance on individual study of the bible which is considered to be the only source of religious authority however you should also get your hands on a copy of a book called martyr s mirror a highly respected publication that chronicles the history of the amish people and honors those who die for their faith it should also be noted that although the amish place utmost importance on living according to the teachings of the bible they do not believe that this is a guaranteed path to salvation they believe that any claim to be saved is an expression of pride and is therefore forbidden attend and host church services amish church service are held every second sunday at the home of one of their community members each amish family is expected to host their friends and neighbors for church about once a year every church district owns a collection of wooden benches which is transported by wagon to the home of the church family and set up in their house and barn seating is arranged with men and boys on one side and women and girls on the other the service lasts approximately three hours and is followed by a light lunch the service is said by 3 to 7 ministers and bishops with the

time is also included with the congregation kneeling on the floor in silent worship although musical instruments are not permitted by the church singing is an important part of every amish service the

communion twice a year get baptized as mentioned before the amish are a branch of the anabaptist church which believes in adult baptism the amish are usually baptized between the ages of 17 and 22 and

adhere to the decision to be baptized must be completely personal and voluntary you must willingly commit yourself to the church for the rest of your life young people are free to leave the amish community before they are baptized and while some of them do most will decide to commit themselves to the church once baptized you will be committed to living your life according to the rules of the ordnung if you break this commitment and fail to repent for your sins you may be shunned by the community where people will avoid having any social contact with you and you will be forced to eat your meals separately from your family if you repent you will be accepted back into the community in time but if you continue to sin you may be excommunicated from the church 11 x research source get married members of the amish community can only marry once they have been baptized and are required to marry other amish though a couple may come from two different amish communities most of a couple s courtship is done in secret with the engagement only being published several weeks before the marriage most weddings occur in the fall after the autumn harvest and are a joyous occasion celebrating the union of two baptized adults who promise to continue living according to amish traditional values and to pass their faith on to their children an amish wedding ceremony is quite different from that of the english no rings are exchanged there are no flowers or music and the bride traditionally makes her own dress which is blue or purple in fact the ceremony is very similar to a regular church service except there is a greater emphasis on the ordinance of marriage which is taken particularly seriously as divorce is forbidden by the amish church 9 x research source after the ceremony a huge feast is held at the home of the bride s parents with as many as 200 to 300 guests the guests are often served in separate sittings followed by the singing of hymns the couple s honeymoon

beard the symbol of a married man the couple will usually be ready to move into a home of their own by the spring following their wedding become an elected member of the church if you re a man amish bishops and deacons are chosen differently from church leaders in other faiths groups of men are first elected by the congregation and then lots are drawn to decide who will become the new minister only baptized married amish men are eligible to become ministers and they are obligated to accept the responsibility once they have been nominated they will usually serve in this ministerial position for life 9 x research source amish bishops and ministers do not receive any formal theological training they are simply called upon by their community to uphold and enforce the teachings of the bible and the rules of the ordnung the system for drawing lots works by placing a sheet of paper with a bible verse into the pages of a songbook this songbook is then arranged in a row of other songbooks each nominated man must choose a songbook and whoever picks the songbook with the bible verse concealed inside is said to have been chosen by god to serve the amish church,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to create an abundance mentality,much of society seems to be built on a scarcity mentality it s a mentality that tells people that there is a lack in life that opportunities are few and far between this is of course useful for marketing and advertisers because if people believe that there is a lack then you can get them to buy stuff thus the economy and society can continue to thrive and prosper by reinforcing a scarcity mentality in people the scarcity mentality can be quite painful for the individual and create a lot of unnecessary fear anxiety and desperation an abundance mentality on the other hand tells you that there are always new chances and opportunities this relieves much of the pressure you may feel if you have a scarcity mentality that makes you think that you ve only got one shot right now or it makes you feel like an utter failure just because you stumbled and things didn t work out an abundance mentality can help you improve your performance since with it you re creating a lot less pressure and anxieties within your own mind here are a few tips to create and reinforce your own abundance mentality,look for the symptoms of a scarcity mentality if you have a scarcity mentality then you will probably take things too seriously you may think to yourself if i fail the sky will fall it won t though and you know that and need to remind yourself but you think it will you become overly nervous and poof you have invited that failure because your negativity becomes an obstacle on your path to success if it s a game then you may fumble with the ball if it s an exam then you may not have been able to sleep and will perform poorly on the test if it s a date you may come over as too needy and nervous and not as your usual more relaxed self regain your empowerment by remembering all the opportunities you have been afforded and know that it is all a flow that will always continue focus on the abundance not on the lack what you focus on you will see in your world since you can t take in everything around you your reticular activation system your focus system in the mind will bring into focus what you focus your thoughts on this will allow you to see the abundance in your world that you may be missing right now if you for instance have a lack of money then don t focus on your lack focus and think about the abundance of possibilities in the world to make money soon ideas and opportunities to make that happen will start to pop up in your world it s almost a bit freaky how things that hold solutions for you perhaps books or acquaintances that have been there in the background for quite a while just one day suddenly jump out at you appreciate one quick way to revert from the pretty normal habit of thinking about what you don t have is simply to appreciate appreciate your food life your roof your friends and family and so on this can not only turn a sour mood into a more positive one within minutes but it can also help you notice opportunities you have missed or forgotten about and it ll create a more open vibe within you a vibe that makes it easier to focus on the abundance so make a habit of appreciating something in your life for a few minutes each day get organized when you don t feel abundant or good about yourself or life in general that can mean you are simply not in order have your home clean your clothes folded your digital files in place and your finances organized have some order and discipline and you ll start seeing results get an abundance vibe from other people since you get a scarcity mentality from say advertising and media then you can change your input to change your mentality cut down on watching the news record your favourite shows and skip the commercials or just cut down on your tv and media consumption period replace the scarcity vibe you get from that input how do you do that hang out with people that have an abundance mentality read listen to and watch personal development material besides reading your favourite personal development blogs read success stories in books and magazines have a positive attitude to the abundance and success of your friends family and co workers hang out with people in real life who have more of an abundance mentality and less of a scarcity mentality be selective with what you put into your mind create your own environment of abundance share the wealth one very good way to acknowledge how much you have is to share it do you feel like you re not making enough money give some away not enough love give some away not enough validation appreciation recognition give it all away it s hard for something to feel scarce when you re giving it away create win win situations people with a scarcity mentality tend to see every relationship is win lose as in it s either you or me buddy and i want it to be me people with an abundance mentality on the other hand try to create mutually beneficial relationships in which both parties can win 1 x research source instead of winning an argument for example try to reach a consensus that you both can be happy with instead of competing collaborate remind yourself it s very easy to slip back into your old thought patterns you just forget about what you should be thinking about a useful tool to keep yourself from slipping is to use external reminders you can for example use written notes posted at places you can t avoid seeing several times each day your workspace fridge and mirrors or put a bracelet on your wrist seeing words or quotes that remind you of your new abundance mentality can help your mind snap back into the right headspace once again when you face your greatest loss it may contain your greatest opportunity if you lose your job and are close to losing your housing you could sell off anything you don t like want or immediately need to cut back on your physical possessions that means less to move so starting over might as well be where you always wanted to live you have to find a way to make a living so it might as well be entry level in whatever you always wanted to do instead of just looking for a job any job shoot high those crises are the point in life where everything that held you back can be left behind and moving toward something better than you ve ever had will make any sacrifices meaningful it s very different being frugal and living small because you re just starting out or living a reduced lifestyle viewed as a failure use the chance to give yourself something that money can t buy like time and freedom,Philosophy-and-Religion

life forming your own philosophy is quite difficult especially for beginners but the rewards definitely make it worth a try this guide will help get started,understand that you are starting a lifelong journey commit to being open minded and flexible every conscious person has a philosophy individual philosophies can be simple developing or well developed a personal philosophy is a fundamental and integrated understanding about existence and your relationship to all related issues discovering and developing one s philosophy requires self awareness a desire to understand and the will and ability to learn commit to looking for meaning and discern what makes sense your goal is to start on a path of personal growth that will evolve and mature as you pursue the love of wisdom philosophia for that is what philosophy means start reading and learning start with what interests you and try to get a sense of the big ideas that philosophers are concerned with as you learn look for connections between ideas and subjects to find coherence and or arguments this is akin to putting a jigsaw puzzle together some pieces will fit and others won t choose a type of philosophy philosophical thought is organized around many types of philosophies including axiology ontology aesthetics epistemology ethics logic metaphysics and political theory follow your interests feel free to choose more than one type because you see particular linkages you will enjoy thinking through how to meld them successfully 1 x research source after deciding a philosophy type learn the background history of your chosen philosophy including readings from the key philosophers understand the key questions that were addressed and get a solid understanding of the key concepts improve your basic understanding of other types of philosophies you cannot be an expert in everything but recognize that there is great value in understanding the basics of what others have done a broad understanding of what people are struggling with and what the discussions have been about will help you to develop your own personal philosophy feel free to learn and build on existing ideas it is difficult starting from scratch so why not take another philosopher s ideas as a basic framework to get started many well known philosophers started like this for example plato took the undoubtedly oral and sociable socratic method from the real socrates 2 x research source and used it as the basis for his highly polished literary socratic method which in turn was taken by aristotle to form the basis of logic particularly syllogisms 3 x research source expand and evolve your thinking the framework you have selected is a starting point as you experience life test it out and see what works for you and what doesn t when you have time analyze this and refine your framework philosophy over time as you solve problems and assess the quality of the decisions you have made you will be able to evolve from where you started into something autonomous of the original philosophy become a critical thinker keep track of where you have obtained the basis for ideas tenets theories etc in your new philosophy being able to trace your theorizing or conclusions back to their source will help you defending your ideas or pushing them further very little develops in a vacuum 4 x research source referring to what other philosophers have said gives your philosophy greater credibility because you are displaying your depth of knowledge and understanding of existing philosophies be patient and allow your ideas to percolate over time when you have spare time analyze the framework of your nascent philosophy and try to find problems and solutions taking the development of your philosophy gradually will allow it to evolve into something autonomous of the original philosophy keep a journal and continue writing down your thoughts and ideas even if they re not coherent patience is essential because it may take you years to sort through all the discarded notions to find the treasure buried underneath the passage of time is healthy as it allows your ideas to keep evolving and to be tested by daily events ask some pertinent questions such as what is the purpose of your philosophy do you want to apply it to all of society or just a sector what is your role in your philosophy what if any are the roles of particular people in your philosophy how will you explain the basis of your philosophy to others is it helpful on a practical level or utopian how do other belief sets or philosophies fit in with or go against your philosophy are you willing to write down a thesis or book of your philosophy or would you rather write stories that contain your philosophy but are not overtly a philosophical work in structure talk to others interested in philosophy they can point out faults you might have missed and give different solutions this is helpful for developing your philosophy join a local philosophy group club or chapter join an online group that has private forums where you can share your ideas freely and get responses visit your local university and ask to speak with philosophy professors to share your thoughts with them if you find someone else who really understands where your new philosophy is headed embrace their enthusiasm but take care to keep working on your understandings separate from their enthusiasm it is hard to follow someone else while they are still working out what it is that they believe so their enthusiasm may just be because they like and trust you actively find seek out new experiences to help you to see things in different ways and from different angles keep an open mind learn to accept criticism and grow from it it might just help strengthen you and your philosophy always have a pencil and a notebook to note down ideas as they occur to you or you come across them keep reading philosophy it will allow you to see previous philosophers attempts what they found and what fallacies they fell into thus progressing your own philosophy this will also help you to see whether or not you are attempting something that a previous philosopher has already tried keep up to date with the world try reading a newspaper once in a while it ll help you apply theories to real situations for example take a serious news story that involves issues impacting on many sectors of society and ask yourself what would i have done work your answers into your developing philosophy to see if it can withstand actual events and provide explanations instruction or greater understanding see yourself as a philosopher whether or not you work as one a career in philosophy or similar roles such as a researcher in a think tank or institute will ensure you dedicate regular time to your philosophy but for the part time philosopher make sure you dedicate enough time to it so you keep improving and don t forget bits of your work 5 x research source try as much as possible to live up to your thoughts even when you are experiencing something uncanny that may distract you from your opinions get back to those notes that you have made about your philosophy or the inspiring

how to consult the i ching using 3 coins,the i ching or yi ching or book of changes is most commonly known as an ancient chinese method of divination in the past it was consulted using yarrow sticks but a common way to consult the i ching is to toss three coins assign a certain value to them record the value and repeat a total of six times to create a hexagram it s most useful to have a specific open ended question in your mind as you consult the i ching because it does not return yes or no answers,gather your coins you can consult the i ching with whatever coins you have handy pennies are a good option if you want to add significance to the process you can use coins minted in years that mean something such as your birth year you can also purchase old chinese coins if you want to add authenticity to the process 1 x research source if you consult the i ching on a regular basis it is good to keep these three coins especially for this purpose you can store them in a small pouch so they won t get mixed up with your everyday change write down your question the i ching is intended for gaining some clarity about a specific dilemma that you are facing so it is important to have a clear and simple question write down your question and continue to look at it and think about it as you perform the consultation 2 x research source it is better to use an open ended question versus a yes no question for example will i become rich might not yield as clear results as what will my finances look like this year you also don t want to think and write a complex question with too many parts rather than writing would it be better to travel to bermuda for my honeymoon or should i save the money to put a down payment on a house you could try what will happen if i travel to bermuda for my honeymoon toss the coins you can shake the coins in your hand briefly and then gently toss them onto a smooth surface it might work well to throw the coins into the lid of a box so that the coins do not roll all over the place 3 x research source the exact method you use for this step is up to you as long as you don t look at the coins to try to get them to fall in a certain way you could even shake them in your hand and simply lay your hand flat on the table letting them fall assign a number each toss of the coins will add up to a certain amount assign a value of three to any coins that are heads and two to any coins that are tails your roll will add up to 6 7 8 or 9 three heads add up to 9 two heads and 1 tail add up to 8 one head and two tails add up to 7 three tails add up to 6 4 x research source learn the meaning of the numbers in the i ching each number corresponds to a few things in the i ching system the sum of the numbers designated to each side of the coin determines the yin or yang of the line whether it is changing or unchanging and whether it is a broken or unbroken line 6 3 tails is considered a changing yin and is drawn as a broken line with an x in the middle 9 3 heads is considered a changing yang and is drawn as a solid line with a circle in the middle 7 2 tails 1 head is considered an unchanging yang and is drawn as a solid line 8 2 heads 1 tail is considered an unchanging yin and is drawn as a broken line repeat the process six times total use the coins to come up with six lines which are called your hexagram each time throw the coins record the number and the line type put the first line as the bottom and draw each successive line above the previous one for some i ching guides you can use the total score that your numbers added up to to find the hexagram value rather than the line pattern if you get six 6s this would add up to 36 six 9s would add up to 63 consult a guidebook there are 63 or in some systems 64 variations of the hexagram pattern if you have an i ching book you can read the meaning of your specific hexagram there have been dozens of translations of the ancient text the wilhelm baynes translation is one of the most influential if you don t already have a copy and you don t want to buy one visit your local library and check the book out or consult while you are at the library the basic way of interpreting your hexagram is matching up the pattern with the list of possible patterns and reading the description of what that pattern represents find an online list of hexagram interpretations since the i ching is an ancient text you can find many websites with comprehensive lists of possible hexagram variations these will offer interpretations of what the meaning of your hexagram could be 5 x research source the i ching is not meant to give exact answers to your questions so it is okay to trust an online i ching guide enter your results into a hexagram calculator some websites allow you to input the results of each of your coin tosses by selecting the line that showed up once you enter all six lines it will locate the proper hexagram for you and give you the meaning 6 x research source for example if your hexagram numbers added up to 45 you would enter that and receive the interpretation of meeting from the i ching,Philosophy-and-Religion

concerns to get them out of your head take 5 20 minutes to write down everything you are feeling anxious about on a piece of paper the physical act of writing things down often helps your thoughts stop racing 6 x research source this can also help you organize your anxious thoughts so you can address their causes later on for example if you re having trouble sleeping because you can t stop thinking about everything you have to do tomorrow try writing down a to do list to get the thoughts out of your head and help you get to sleep think about positive alternative scenarios to stop worrying anxious thoughts are often a result of you thinking about worst case scenarios try to come up with at least 1 positive alternative every time you have an anxious thought about something that might go wrong 7 x research source for example if you are worried about turning a project in to your boss think about ways it could help your career if your boss really loves your work say you re studying for a test in a topic that you find difficult and you keep thinking about what will happen if you fail the test so it s hard to focus on studying instead try thinking about how great you can do on the test and how it will boost your grade if you study hard work on any tasks that are hanging over your head it s normal to avoid certain big tasks or responsibilities that you re not looking forward to taking care of but this also tends to generate anxiety instead of avoiding something face it head on and work on it systematically to get it over with 8 x research source for example you might be avoiding putting a big report together at work because it s slow and tedious but you find your mind wandering to this task that s hanging over you set aside time in each day to work on the report so you make progress instead of just dreading it talk to someone to get your anxious thoughts out of your head it s easy to get stuck in a loop of going over and over something in your head if you don t ever talk to anyone about it talk to a friend family member or even a therapist to help you get some perspective on something that s making you anxious and causing your mind to wander 9 x research source for example if you can t seem to focus on anything because all you re thinking about is your ongoing divorce maybe seeing a therapist to talk about it would help you control those thoughts if your mind is wandering because you re frustrated about something at work maybe getting a coffee with a coworker you trust and talking to them about whatever the issue is will help calm your mind try to accept the things that you cannot change accept that the current moment in your day or life isn t exactly what you want it to be and tell yourself that it will pass for example this will help you focus on the present moment rather than wasting your energy thinking about something that you have no control over 10 x research source for instance say you re having trouble focusing on being present with your family over a long weekend because you re worried about something at work try to accept that in this particular moment you can t do anything about your work tasks and focus on enjoying the family time pay attention to the root causes of anxious thoughts and address them take note of the specific ways your mind wanders and try to identify any underlying reasons why your mind is wandering think about ways you can address these root causes to stop your mind from wandering 11 x research source for example if your mind is continuously thinking about what it would be like to work in a different job it might be time to consider a career change and start looking for another position if you keep thinking about a conflict with a colleague you re having at work it might help calm your thoughts to sit down with them and talk about it do 1 task at a time to concentrate on just that 1 thing complete 1 work project or 1 piece of homework before moving onto your next task for example this will keep your mind focused on 1 thing to prevent it from wandering and you ll find that you re able to get more done 12 x research source any activities you do throughout your day can be considered tasks for instance when you re eating your lunch try to focus just on your lunch don t try to multitask and work or study while you eat if you re talking to someone try to focus 100 on the conversation and not let yourself get distracted by noises or other people around you after the conversation is over move on to your next task if you need to put together a presentation for a work meeting focus on getting the presentation totally done before you move onto another task like checking your email or looking at data practice avoiding momentary distractions to build concentration try not to let yourself get distracted by small things like people walking by something outside the window or someone making noises actively keep your attention on the task in front of you instead of looking up and away every time there is a small distraction 13 x research source for example if you work in an office with a bunch of other people around it can be tempting to look around the room to find the culprit any time someone coughs or sneezes don t let yourself do this if you have to sit next to a window and there is something going on outside that distracts you such as a building under construction practice not looking out the window every time a crane moves you can also try removing distractions in settings like classrooms and offices by closing drapes or blinds to block your view or putting in headphones to block out noise designate a specific time to worry think or plan set aside a block of time each day to allow yourself to get lost in your thoughts so your mind doesn t wander as much when you re doing tasks allow yourself to think about the things that you find your mind keeps wandering to during this time then refocus on your next task when the time is up 14 x research source for example you could give yourself a free thinking period from 5 30 6 00 every day during this time don t try to work study or get any other tasks done for these 30 minutes let yourself think about any worries you have or do any planning you need to do say you keep thinking about an upcoming vacation and all the things you still need to do to get ready instead of letting your mind wander to it all day designate a time block during which you can do things like making a packing list or researching sites you want to visit then refocus on your other tasks,Philosophy-and-Religion

digestion are weak you may even feel heavy after meals decide if you prefer warm cool or hot weather if you ve ever fought with someone over a thermostat setting you know that different people can

how to argue that god does not exist,most people around the world believe that god exists it can be challenging to effectively argue that god does not exist however scientific historical philosophical and cultural evidence can all be brought into play when developing a compelling argument that god does not exist whatever approach you adopt ensure that you stay polite and considerate when discussing whether god exists,propose that living beings are poorly designed the argument from poor design states that if god is perfect why did he create us and many other living creatures so poorly for instance we are vulnerable to many diseases our bones break easily and with age our bodies and minds break down you could also mention our poorly made spines inflexible knees and pelvic bones that make childbirth difficult and painful for women 1 x research source together this biological evidence indicates that god does not exist or that he did not create us well in which case there is no reason to worship him believers might counter this argument by stating that if god is perfect then he created us as well as could possibly be expected they might also argue that what we see as imperfections actually have a purpose in the larger workings of god s design point out the logical fallacy in this right away we can t live our lives hoping that one day an explanation for why our eyes or shoulders were designed so poorly will arise reference the philosopher voltaire who wrote a novel about people looking for meaning after a devastating earthquake hit paris we are pattern seeking animals so naturally we look and hope for patterns where none can be found some might point out that god originally created humans in their perfect form but after humanity sinned against god god s original creation became corrupt and wrought with sin and death and entropy entered the world as a result be aware of this rebuttal when using the flawed design argument show the history of replacing supernatural with natural explanations 2 x research source the god of the gaps argument is common when people argue that god exists it argues that whiles modern science can explain many things it cannot explain others you can refute this by saying that the things we do not understand are decreasing every year and that while natural explanations have replaced theistic explanations supernatural or theistic explanations never replace scientific ones for instance you might cite the example of evolution as one area where science has revised previous god centric explanations for the variety of species in our world argue that religion has often been used to explain the unexplainable the greeks used poseidon to explain how earthquakes happen which we now know is due to the movement of tectonic plates to relieve pressure demonstrate the inaccuracy of creationism if the existence of the world can be explained purely in scientific terms then it is unnecessary to say that god brought the world into being according to the principle of occam s razor the simplest explanation is generally the best creationism is the belief that god created the world usually within a relatively recent time frame like 5 000 6 000 years ago draw on the wealth of reasonable evidence that disproves this such as evolutionary data fossils radiocarbon dating and ice cores to argue that creationism is false and that belief in god is unnecessary 3 x research source for instance you might say we find rocks all the time that are dated to be millions or even billions of years old doesn t this conflict with the belief that the universe was recently created by god some might argue that the earth only appears to be old because noah s flood dramatically changed the climate and geology of the earth however this fails to explain the millions of craters on the moon and the supernovas in outer space argue that belief in god is socially determined there are several variations on this idea you could explain that in relatively poor nations almost everyone believes in god while in relatively rich and developed nations few people believe in god 4 x research source you could also state that people who are well educated are more likely to be atheists than those who have lower levels of education together these facts make a strong case that god is only a cultural product and belief in god depends on one s particular social circumstances you could also suggest that people who are raised in one religion overwhelmingly tend to stick with that religion throughout their lives those who were not raised in a religious household conversely rarely become religious later 5 x research source explain that just because most people believe in god it is not necessarily true 6 x research source one common reason for belief in god is that most people believe it this common consent argument might also suppose that because belief in god is so high such a belief must be natural however you can refute this idea by proposing that just because many people believe something it is not right for instance you might explain that belief in the greek gods was common but is now no longer socially acceptable suggest that if people are not exposed to religion or the idea of god they will tend to not believe in god explore the variety of religious belief 7 x research source the identities and characteristics of the christian hindu and buddhist gods are very different therefore you could argue that even if god exists there is no way to know which god should be worshipped this is known formally as the argument from inconsistent revelations demonstrate the contradictions within religious texts most religions offer their holy texts as both a product of and evidence for their god if you can demonstrate that a holy text is inconsistent or otherwise flawed you d provide a solid justification for god s nonexistence for instance if god is described in one part of the holy text as forgiving but later wipes out a whole village or country you could use this apparent contradiction to demonstrate that god could not exist or that the holy text is lying in the case of the bible often entire verses stories and anecdotes were falsified or changed at some point for instance mark 9 29 and john 7 53 to 8 11 contain passages that were copied from other sources 8 x research source explain that this demonstrates that holy texts are just a mishmash of creative ideas produced by people not divinely inspired books argue that if god exists he would not allow so much unbelief this argument proposes that where atheism exists god would descend or intervene personally in the world to reveal himself to atheists 9 x research source the fact that so many atheists exist however and that god has not attempted to persuade them through divine intervention means that god likely does not exist believers might counter this claim by stating that god allows free will and that therefore unbelief is an inevitable outcome of this they might cite specific instances in their holy texts of occasions when their god revealed himself to people who still refused to believe explore inconsistency in the other person s belief if the believer s faith is premised on the idea that god created the universe because all things have a beginning and an end you could ask if that is so then what created god 10 x research source this will emphasize to the other person that they are unfairly concluding that god exists when in fact the same basic premise that all things have a beginning can lead to two different conclusions people who believe in god might counter that god being omnipotent is outside of space and time and is therefore the exception to the rule that all things have a beginning and an end if they counter in this way you should direct the argument towards the contradictions in the idea of omnipotence explore the problem of evil 11 x research source the problem of evil asks how god can exist if evil exists in other words if god exists and is good he should eliminate all evil if god truly cared about us you could argue there would be no wars your conversation partner might reply governments by man are ungodly and fallible people not god cause evil in this way your conversation partner might again invoke the idea of free will to counter the notion that god is responsible for all the wickedness in the world still this counter fails to explain the evil that is not caused by humans such as sickness from microorganisms and earthquakes you could also go one step further and argue that even if a bad god exists who does allow evil he is not worth worshiping demonstrate that morality does not require any religious belief 12 x research source many people believe that without religion the planet would descend into immoral chaos however you can explain that your own behavior or that of any other atheist is little different than that of the believer admit that while you are not perfect nobody is and belief in god does not drive people to necessarily be more moral or righteous than anyone else you could also reverse this proposition by arguing that not only does religion not lead to goodness it leads to evil since many religious people commit immoral acts in the name of their god you might for instance draw attention to the spanish inquisition or religious terrorism around the world in addition animals who are incapable of understanding our human concept of religion show clear evidence of instinctual understanding of moral behavior and distinguishing between right and wrong you could argue that morality is a social behavior that helps ensure the collective survival of a species and is not necessarily spiritually linked demonstrate that a good life does not require god many people believe that only with god can one live a rich happy and full life 13 x research source however you could point out that many people who do not believe are happier and more successful than those who are religious for instance you might draw attention to richard dawkins or christopher hitchens as individuals who met with great success despite the fact they do not believe in god explain the contradiction between omniscience and free will omniscience the ability to know everything seems to be at odds in most religious dogma free will refers to the idea that you are in charge of your actions and therefore responsible for them most religions believe in both concepts but they are incompatible say to your conversation partner if god knows everything that has happened and will happen as well as every thought your mind creates before you think it your future is a foregone conclusion that being the case how can god judge us for what we do people who believe in god may answer that although god knows an individual s decision beforehand individual actions are still each person s free choice this idea is a nice thought but it is still contradictory for the reasons above 14 x research source show the impossibility of omnipotence 15 x research source omnipotence is the ability to do anything if god can do anything though he should be able to for instance draw a square circle however since this is logically incoherent it makes no sense to believe that god is omnipotent another logically impossible thing you could suggest god cannot do is to know and not know something at the same time you could also argue that if god is omnipotent why does he allow natural disasters massacres and wars some believers offer the idea that perhaps god isn t completely omnipotent and that while he is extremely powerful he cannot do absolutely everything this may explain why god can do some things but cannot logically do others put the ball in their court in reality it is impossible to prove that something does not exist anything could exist but in order for a belief to be valid and worthy of attention it needs hard evidence to back it up 16 x research source propose that rather than arguing that god does not exist the believer needs to provide evidence that god does exist for instance you could ask what happens after death many people who believe in god also believe in an afterlife ask for evidence of this afterlife spiritual entities such as gods devils heaven hell angels demons and so on have never been and cannot be scientifically examined or observed point out that these spiritual features cannot be proven to exist if they are not observable and measurable do your homework 17 x research source prepare to argue that god doesn t exist by familiarizing yourself with the main arguments and ideas of well known atheists god is not great by christopher hitchens for instance is a good place to start the god delusion by richard dawkins is another excellent source of rational arguments against the existence of a religious deity in addition to researching arguments in favor of atheism investigate the rebuttals or justifications from the religious perspective be familiar with the issues or beliefs that might invite your opponent s criticism and ensure you can adequately defend your own beliefs arrange your arguments in a logical way 18 x research source if your arguments are not presented in a straightforward understandable way your message will be lost on the person you re talking to and your arguments will be weak for instance when explaining how one s religion is culturally determined you should get the other person to agree with each of your premises the basic facts that lead to your conclusion you might say mexico was settled by a catholic country right when they answer yes move on to the next premise like most people in mexico are catholic right when they answer yes move on to your conclusion by saying for instance the reason that most people believe in god in mexico is the history of the religious culture there be accommodating when discussing god s existence belief in god is a sensitive topic approach the debate as a conversation in which both you and your conversation partner have valid points speak in a friendly manner to your conversation partner ask them for reasons as to why they believe so strongly in their faith listen patiently to their reasons and tailor your responses appropriately and thoughtfully to what they have to say 19 x research source ask your conversation partner for resources books or websites that you can use to learn more about their perspective and beliefs belief in god is complicated and statements about god s existence either for or against cannot be taken as fact stay calm the existence of god can be an emotionally charged topic if you are excited or aggressive during the conversation you might be incoherent and or say something that you regret 20 x research source try deep breathing to stay calm breathe in slowly through your nose for five seconds then breathe out through your mouth for three seconds repeat until you feel calm slow down your rate of speech so that you have more time to think about what you want to say and avoid saying something you later regret if you start feeling angry say to your conversation partner let s agree to disagree then part ways from them be polite when discussing god remember a lot of people are sensitive about their religions be respectful of those who believe in god do not use offensive or accusatory language like bad stupid or crazy do not call your conversation partner names in the end rather than making a concise point your opponent will often default to i m sorry you re going to hell do not respond with an equally passive aggressive retort,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to deal with religious people if you are an atheist,if you are an atheist you ll come across your share of religious people who are genuinely curious about and respectful of your perspective even if they completely disagree with it you ll also encounter religious people who are ignorant about atheism eager to convert you to their truth and or hostile to your very presence many disagreements and arguments can be avoided through tact patience and common sense and when they can t or shouldn t be avoided a thoughtful and respectful approach can help prevent a contentious situation,don t bring up the subject unnecessarily you should never feel like you have to lie or pretend about what you believe or don t if you re asked about your religious beliefs be honest however you also don t need to be a walking advertisement for atheism at all times either if you re in a room full of believers think carefully before steering the conversation towards your lack of belief there s nothing wrong with sitting quietly sometimes and it never hurts to listen to others talk about what they believe we all have to sometimes listen to people talk about subjects we don t care for or don t understand hockey poetry auto repair or whatever it may be just sit it out and wait for the subject to change keep the focus on other topics instead of sitting back and hoping the conversation doesn t turn toward religion or waiting for it to pass on to another subject if it does you can work to steer the conversation towards topics that may be more comfortable for everyone involved consider the audience and bring up topics that are likely to be of general interest it may seem trite to discuss sports or the weather at thanksgiving dinner but it s probably preferable to a knock down drag out fight over deeply held religious beliefs even politics may be a less contentious topic to bring up for example if your religious friends start to discuss their church activities try saying that s great you re so involved in your church what other activities do you enjoy doing outside of church i ve been trying to find some new activities to do this is likely to shift the conversation to jet skiing stamp collecting volunteering at an animal shelter etc refrain respectfully or partially engage in prayers or religious rituals as an atheist there will be times when you will feel you need to stand up for what you believe be it the teaching of creationism in public schools or prayers before city council meetings it s okay to decide that every little thing isn t worth fighting for though like choosing to simply sit quietly during a prayer before a group meal you have to decide for yourself when to let things go 1 x research source if someone happens to complain that you aren t bowing your head during the prayer or showing the proper reverence in some other setting calmly offer to discuss the topic privately later if for instance you are at thanksgiving dinner and are asked to give some sort of blessing or say what you are thankful for you can do so without invoking any god or religion say something like i am thankful for the people who grew this food those who provided it and those who prepared it i am thankful that we can all be together now to enjoy it and each other s company spend time with other atheists while it s healthy instructive and usually necessary to spend a good bit of time around religious people it s also alright to seek out the comfort of being around others whose perspectives align more with your own with a little searching you ll probably find a welcoming community of fellow atheists atheists make up about 3 of the u s population however within your community it may seem as if you re alone particularly if you live in a small town try finding support online 2 x trustworthy source pew research center nonpartisan thinktank conducting research and providing information on public opinion demographic trends and social trends go to source check out the websites for american atheists american humanist association or similar groups in your area or nation they may have local get togethers or events 3 x research source 4 x research source stay calm and don t get defensive instead of reacting defensively when someone attacks your point of view take a moment to collect your thoughts determine what you want to say before you say it 5 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source remember you don t have to defend your point of view to anyone your views are equally right and important use i statements this will help to diffuse a potentially bad situation for example i am feeling attacked right now i would appreciate it if i could have a moment to collect my thoughts 6 x research source don t try to force your point of view on others even if you are resentful because you feel like religion is often forced upon you don t stoop to the same level if bullying tactics don t work in convincing you that you should be religious don t expect the reverse to work with others if you are resentful towards religion consider that much of your resentment probably stems from people attempting to force their beliefs on you think of how you d like to be treated if the situation was reversed allow others the opportunity to speak otherwise you ll come across as aggressive which will likely lead to conflict agree to disagree don t try to determine whose point of view is right especially when dealing with something as deeply personal as religious belief attempting to resolve who is right and who is wrong will only prove futile focus on explaining what you believe and why in a calm reasoned manner 7 x research source if you ve been going back and forth put an end to the conversation at least for the time being you may want to say it seems like we ve been going back and forth on this issue for awhile i respect your opinion and i hope you can respect mine but i think we should agree to disagree don t bring up the subject again unless there is new information to cover remember everyone regardless of their beliefs assumes they are right you re not going to convince someone otherwise in one conversation 8 x research source don t argue with someone trying to convert you to their religious beliefs having a lively discussion with someone who hopes to convert you can help to clarify your thoughts and learn more about others beliefs getting into a heated debate or outright argument with someone who is never going to budge however won t achieve anything positive give them an opportunity to speak once they have finished their thought thank them for their time give a measured calm response or none at all if you so choose if the person is a friend let them know you value their friendship but feel uncomfortable by them trying to convert you if they keep trying to convert you you may need to reconsider the friendship if the person shows up at your door don t just slam it in their face let them say what they came to say take any materials they offer you and thank them for their time walk away when a calm discussion is not possible if things get too heated simply walk away there is no shame in leaving a conversation that isn t going anywhere you can always choose to resume the discussion at another time if you choose but you need not do so if you see no point in trying again let them know you re ending the conversation you can say i am feeling disrespected right now and am going to take myself out of this situation walk away and give yourself some time to cool down if you think of another point you d like to make don t put yourself back into a bad situation send an email or ask if you can discuss the topic with the person at a later time do your homework it is very difficult for a constructive dialogue to take place if there is no common ground of understanding between the two parties before engaging in a conversation with a religious person educate yourself on the basics of their beliefs 9 x research source especially if you are very unfamiliar with the person s religion search online read articles consult books and consider taking a look at the faith s sacred text s this will help you better understand where the other person is coming from and will help you to generate questions about their faith 10 x research source it is completely fair for you to expect the same of the other person offer to recommend some key atheist works that speak to your point of view and ask the person to consult them to facilitate your discussion you can always delay and resume the conversation at another time 11 x research source define what atheism means to you before you can explain to others what it means to be an atheist you need to be able to explain it to yourself you don t have to use a textbook definition of atheism there is no single atheist view just as there is no single christian or hindu view come up with a definition that works for you 12 x research source before you begin the conversation ask if the person understands what an atheist is you may want to say i m looking forward to talking with you about atheism before we start why don t you tell me what you know about it if they don t know anything about atheism or assume that it means you believe in nothing or are satanic in some way don t criticize them for it instead quickly provide them with some basic information about atheism you can start the conversation by saying why don t i tell you a little bit more about atheism so you know where i m coming from if necessary provide some source recommendations for the other person to consult and request that you resume the conversation at another time ask questions and listen to answers with curiosity and respect make an effort to understand the other point of view by listening and asking questions this will show that you are engaged in the discussion if you don t have specific questions ask open ended ones such as tell me more about your beliefs or how did you come to believe what you do listen when they respond make eye contact and focus on what the person is saying now is not the time to be planning your next question or trying to look up something on your phone 13 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source don t ask questions that are purposely leading and antagonistic for example refrain from saying something like what makes you think your religion is so much better than others instead try asking what aspects of your religion set it apart from others this is a nicer way of asking the same question avoid taking cheap shots you may think the other person s belief system is ridiculous but offering ridicule will get you nowhere positive just because you may have read somewhere that there is a negative correlation between iq and religiosity that is that less intelligent people tend to be more religious doesn t mean you should make generalized assumptions or critical remarks about the other person being foolish or delusional offer respect if you want to be given respect 14 x research source steer clear of open ended or hostile questions that won t move the conversation along for example refrain from asking why are christians so crazy you re not only generalizing but you re backing the person into a corner as they couldn t possibly begin to answer your question don t blame the person for all the evils you believe have been done in the name of that religion you don t want to be blamed for all the evils done by those who rejected religion do you you can ask however how their religion reconciles evil acts done under the guise of the faith be open to learning something new don t just say you re open to learning something new mean what you say in learning more about other faiths you ll only broaden your own worldview if your beliefs will be threatened by knowledge then maybe they ought to be reconsidered anyway an atheist should be someone who is open to asking questions and seeking answers like a good scientist an atheist should never be afraid of being proven wrong truth should be your ultimate goal 15 x research source if the person invites you to a religious service agree to go as a respectful observer you don t have to convert to their religion or share their beliefs but you will certainly learn something new you in turn can invite them to a gathering of others like

how to become an atheist,atheism in its broadest sense is an absence of belief in the existence of gods this definition includes both those who assert that there are no gods and those who make no claim about whether gods exist or not simply stated anyone who does not say i believe a god gods exist is by definition an atheist narrower and more common definitions however often only qualify those who assert there are no gods as atheists labeling the others as agnostics or simply non theists there is no single ideology that all atheists share nor are there any institutionalized rituals or behaviors there are certain individuals whose religious or spiritual beliefs some might describe as atheistic though those holding such beliefs do not normally describe themselves as atheists due to some contrary belief primarily in heavily religious countries being an atheist does not imply deliberately disobeying god atheism is not a belief but is only the absence thereof atheists are also sometimes accused of hating god which is impossible since you can not hate something you do not believe exists atheism is not directly linked to evolution nor the big bang theory however many atheists primarily those who wish to study atheism and religion further turn to science hence gaining an interest in such theories in countries such as the united states of america and continents such as asia religion is thriving although it may seem black and white countries with the highest poverty and murder rates lowest education rates and human development rates hdi tend to be the most religious in contrast with the most atheistic countries such as norway and sweden this can also be observed in the us by state,examine your current beliefs no matter what you previously believed if now deep down you find no belief in god your transformation is already complete there is no process or initiation for becoming an atheist except possibly a coming out to others if you can honestly think i don t believe there is a god gods you are already an atheist 1 x research source understand the difference between belief and truth consider the following examples 2 x research source a stranger comes to your door and tells you that your child has been killed in a car accident outside their school you would feel a pang of emotion but this is a stranger do you believe them do they know who your child is is this some sort of cruel joke do you really believe that your child has been killed you will be inclined to harbor some strong doubts two police officers come to your door squad car in the driveway they tell you your child has been killed they need you to come with them to identify the body you will in all likelihood believe them they are police officers you will feel the emotion as though you know for a fact that your child is dead it will be real to you you should notice that the difference between these two examples is the authority of the messenger not the message itself these examples are also chosen for their emotional content because the emotional content is a large part of what makes a situation real to us the point is whether we believe something based on authority or emotion or both we cannot know it is true until we see with our own eyes the highest authority you can imagine could tell you the simplest thing and you may believe them and they may believe themselves but that does not in any way make it true understand the difference between scientific belief and religious belief the difference between belief in a scientific theory as opposed to belief in a religious dogma boils down to the difference between the institution of science and the institutions of various religions the underlying concept in religious institutions is that the nature of reality is known the nature of reality is written in a book or scroll this writing was originally done or dictated or inspired by a god religious institutions are primarily concerned with spreading information about the known nature of reality because in their understanding of reality that is what they are required to do religious facts are not subject to testing and in most cases cannot be tested religious facts are supported by evidence that is open to interpretation or no evidence at all religious facts are not reviewed by all religions to reach a consensus the underlying concept in the institution of science is that the nature of reality is unknown the institution of science is primarily concerned with discovering the nature of reality without making assumptions scientific theories must by definition be testable falsifiable theories must be published for review by other scientists with the intention of reaching a consensus accepted theories are supported by evidence that is not open to interpretation or is consistently interpreted by qualified scientists if evidence is found that contradicts a theory the theory will be abandoned one believes in a scientific authority because they derive their authority from the review process and because they have an interest in discovering the truth one believes in a religious authority because they have been given authority by their superiors who in turn get their authority from their subordinates religion has no interest in discovering the truth because the facts are already known 3 x research source remember that you aren t the only person who has found fault with their religion people throughout history have looked critically at their religious beliefs and found fault if you have issues and problems then look at them honestly with the notion that you will not be punished for trying to find what you truly believe if your beliefs are valid then they will stand up to scrutiny most of the religions that have ever been have gone extinct you would be hard pressed to find people worshiping thor or quetzalcoatl take a hard look at why you don t believe in thor or rah or zeus would you be islamic christian or jewish if you were raised in iran mississippi or israel consider your ethics and try to understand where they come from 4 x research source you don t need a god gods to be moral atheists are not unethical like many theists many atheists donate to charity and live lives that are morally similar to those of theists atheists just might have different motivations for doing so with or without religion good people can behave well and bad people can do evil but for good people to do evil that takes religion 5 x research source steven weinberg understand the difference between atheism and agnosticism 6 x research source an atheist does not believe that a god gods do exist most atheists observe that there is no proof that a god gods exist because there is no verifiable evidence that a god gods exist they do not incorporate a god gods into their decision making agnostics do not believe it is possible to know of the existence of a god or gods you do not have to be anti religion most atheists however do disapprove of organized religion as well as the doctrine of faith as a virtue there are others who still attend religious services for their own reasons such as an agreement with some of the moral tenets membership in a community or even just a fondness for the music you do not have to write off the possibility of unverified or unverifiable phenomena you can acknowledge that they are possible without insisting or acting as if they are true or trying to convince others that they are true you do not have to subscribe to any set of beliefs atheism is not a religion atheists hold a wide variety of beliefs and outlooks the only similarity being a lack of belief in a god or gods understand that you do not have to give up your culture culture tradition and tribal loyalty are important to many people including atheists by denying belief in a god gods one need not totally dissociate oneself with the culture associated with his or her former religion virtually every northern hemispheric culture celebrates a winter solstice holiday a possible explanation for this is the lack of agrarian work to be performed and the abundance of food stores for the dearth winter months ahead such a celebration can be and is in many cases still important to an atheist for its intrinsic values those of sharing and community among others formerly christian atheists still exchange gifts with their theist friends put up christmas trees and gather with family and friends during christmastime without any religious connotation necessary the same can be said of those formerly of other faiths or never of any faith learn to see and come to conclusions about the world through a logical lens rather than through faith the scientific method is universally accepted as the best way to understand the world discuss the world in this context with other atheists and with religious people this will help you understand why people believe what they do and help you understand your atheism in that context study various forms of theism 7 x research source while most atheists argue that theists are making a positive assertion and thus bear the burden of proof it is important to thoroughly understand your former faith and its tenets as well as those of other faiths the more versed you are in other religions and the more you understand why people believe what they do the better basis you ll have for your worldview also it will help you fend off those that will try to convert you to their religion once they learn of your atheism communicate your perspective to those who are curious do not be shy but don t be condescending try to help them understand your point of view in a non confrontational manner however you may choose to hide your perspective if it is clear you are going to run into trouble in some countries or regions the price of atheism can be very high,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to persuade a christian to become atheist,belief is deeply personal and deeply rooted in both how we are raised and our emotions our beliefs help us make sense of the world and give us a guideline for how we treat others every person is entitled to their beliefs and disrespecting those who do not share a belief of your own is a moral disservice to them and yourself however in some cases you may think a certain belief is harmful for the individual or society engaging in regular theological discussions can help change your friend s mindset or even your own just know that change is a long process,educate yourself read everything you can about atheism christianity and religious history learn both sides of the coin both atheist and christian beliefs in addition to other religions and belief systems morals and values run parallel through many belief systems allowing for common grounds for discussion in all religions there are many resources online that can help you learn about religious systems including podcasts and audio and visual classes 1 x research source read and understand their holy book cover to cover argument and persuasion cannot be effectively built out of thin air you must understand where your friend is coming from in order to build a bridge between your two belief systems the bible is regarded as one of the most influential sources on literature in western culture it is a great read for narrative merit alone 2 x research source learn common arguments leveled by theists even though it is not possible to prepare for every argument you should know some of the more common talking points in christian apologetics these include arguments like the fine tuned universe which argues that our universe supports life so well and works in such a precise way that it must have been intelligently designed this argument directly challenges our science based understanding of the origins of the universe some may also argue that atheism is unscientific because of the belief that in the beginning non matter created matter they may say that this has never been observed tested or repeated therefore some will argue that an ultimate creator is needed to fix this dilemma another argument pascal s wager is the suggestion that one should live their life under the assumption that god does exist given that the stakes are skewed if god does not exist your life simply ends however if god does exist how you behaved in life determines whether you will be rewarded eternally in heaven or punished eternally in hell this argument though steeped in logic raises questions of honesty morality and the extent of god s powers 3 x research source examine your own myths urban legends and superstitions learn why people believe stories backed by anecdotal evidence understanding something about belief as it pertains to psychology will better prepare you for counter arguments and why you may feel the way you do about your own beliefs urban myths such as bloody mary for example have no proof or scientific basis and are believed to be untrue however the myth is still passed around because the idea that such events could exist is alluring and fun urban myths and other legends often stem from real life events or people that actually existed but the truth behind them has become exaggerated or twisted over time bloody mary for example may stem from mary worth a woman hanged for witchcraft or queen mary i of england who was known for her ruthlessness 4 x research source study basic physics and biology some arguments stem from misinterpretations and misinformation about physics or biology understanding the core of these subjects will allow you to challenge unscientific arguments and assumptions evolution is the most widely known areas of contention between some christians and atheists studying natural selection and how creatures survive and die off is a good place to start your studies let them engage let them engage the conversation first this sidesteps any feelings that you may be attacking their belief system with an agenda remain calm firm and reasonable a common stereotype of atheists is that they are angry and hostile explain why you are an atheist and what that means to you the goal of conversation is to wipe away preconceived notions about one another s beliefs for example you could say i believe that people have the ability to identify and choose right from wrong by experiencing life on their own you might also say people are wildly complex and interesting i believe they can make mistakes but also learn from them without needing to be policed ask questions about their beliefs why do they hold a particular belief sometimes pointing out a single fallacy every now and then is sufficient ask them to explain something about their religion you don t understand to help you to think about deeper meaning you might ask your friend how can god allow some in the world to starve and others to eat you might also ask i m interested in what christians think of the fact that the bible was written by several individuals is it difficult to trust in so many differing accounts suggest your friend start questioning everyday occurrences questioning authenticates truth and can become a habit that help change thinking 5 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source stay casual show that atheism has not impacted your life in a negative way if they bring up their belief that god had a hand in an event in their life it is okay to point out other factors that helped them such as their own actions or a professional s skills for example getting accepted into college might feel like a divine gift but it was an individual s hard work that paved the way you might tell them congratulations all of that studying really paid off avoid logical fallacies both sides of any debate will often create incorrect argumentation and rely on rhetoric without even noticing common informal fallacies in debate include circular reasoning which begins and ends an argument with the same idea for example the bible makes no false claims whatever the bible says is true thus the bible contains only truth the second and third portions of the argument are the same concept and thus not an argument of merit 6 x research source socialize with them spend a day with an eclectic group of friends that come from all walks of life exposure to others views and philosophies helps all of us expand our thinking avoid activities that might make your friends of particular faiths uncomfortable such as wild parties or violent movies board games shopping or hiking are excellent activities that everyone can enjoy give your friend practical advice for their problems use personal experience to offer authenticity if your friend shares some wisdom from the bible quote similar wisdom from another belief system or a wise historical individual for example if your friend is falling behind at school i feel you i had a hard time dealing with all that homework too have you looked into study groups i joined one with my classmates and we ended up finishing the homework in half the time in times of your friend s lack of confidence you might offer when i feel down i always think to this great buddhist quote you can explore the universe looking for somebody who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself and you will not find that person anywhere know when to back away do not let differences and debate cause the end of a friendship know when to drop the conversation don t raise your voice a raised voice often indicates or leads to anger which can throw the discussion off track if your friend begins to raise their voice ease off of the conversation avoid physicality a discussion that turns physical is no longer a discussion if you or your friend start getting pushy end the conversation and put some space between the two of you for the time being talking about your feelings behind your thoughts helps create a more peaceful and constructive atmosphere show your friend that you are coming from a place of caring rather than just looking to win an argument 7 x research source keep the argument on track if the conversation turns to other issues such as personal attacks or insults it is time to drop the conversation if your friend becomes angry or hurt back away from the conversation and apologize even if you feel you are in the right hurting another s feelings was not the intent of the conversation and you don t want to risk your friendship be open minded listen and understand their point of view if their faith brings them peace and fulfillment accept that fact don t damage or take

how to understand people who believe in god for atheists,regardless of whether or not you believe in god talking about religion often leads to conflict people have very different beliefs and oftentimes they are not very good at expressing them respectfully in order to understand people who believe in god you must display an open mind and a willingness to listen and learn,visit different houses of worship as an atheist it s easy to completely isolate yourself from different religious schools of thought but this is ultimately not helpful for your growth visit as many different

respect someone s point of view does not mean you agree with it don t try to change people one of the big problems with organized religion is that oftentimes believers feel compelled to convert non believers atheists are not immune from this when you meet a person who believes in god don t try to explain to them why they shouldn t instead listen to them when they talk and try to understand where they re coming from 6 x research source remember that your choice to not believe in god is not being challenged by another person s choice to believe in god use humor to connect with one another and

entire conversation waiting to argue your point of view instead be present for the conversation by listening actively and constructively 11 x research source when someone tells you something paraphrase what they just said to show you understand ask questions to move the conversation forward instead of letting it stall out be empathetic and acknowledge the other person s feelings make sure you re both defining god the same way sometimes different people have different definitions of what god actually is before you engage in a conversation with someone who believes in god make sure you re both defining god in the same way ask the person you re talking with to clarify what their god entails before getting into a theological discussion check in at different points in the conversation to make sure you re still on the same page this will prevent you from arguing over one another have a collaborative conversation not a confrontation regardless of how persuasive your argument is the person you re talking with is probably not going to leave the conversation an atheist treat your conversation like a religious exploration and you may both leave having learned something new ask questions that challenge your partner s beliefs but do so because you re interested not because you re trying to trip them up if the other person makes a good point tell them learning about god should not be a competition,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to be an atheist,an atheist is someone that does not believe in gods or deities just like religious people atheists have their own boundaries beliefs and ethical stances and any two atheists may exercise their lack of religion in completely different ways 1 x research source in order to be an atheist you must decide what it means to you to live without religion whether your background is religious or secular you must define your own morals face your own mortality and figure out how to respectfully explain your beliefs to your religious peers,consider what it means to be an atheist atheism is the lack of belief in a particular deity or higher spiritual power theism denotes belief in a deity 2 x research source so atheism is literally the absence of that being atheistic commonly but not always includes disregarding traditional religious spirituality and practice in favor of a more materialistic rationalistic and often humanistic conception of the universe and being most atheists embrace the idea of materialism in the philosophical sense that nothing exists beyond the physical matter that includes your being materialists believe that you have this life and this life alone don t mistake it for the colloquial meaning of materialism which means being preoccupied with acquiring physical things 3 x research source some people mistakenly link atheism with satanism since they both reject god this is not true however as satanism comes with a whole set of beliefs and rituals atheism is by definition the lack of any religious beliefs or rituals be skeptical of things that you cannot directly perceive if you are a skeptic it means that you demand evidence before believing something and that you only believe things when a scientific consensus indicates sufficient evidence many atheists and agnostics consider themselves skeptics decide whether you are atheistic or agnostic gnosticism indicates a state of certainty while agnosticism is the belief that one cannot know for sure you may be agnostic if you do not have a yes or no answer to the question of whether god exists you do not have to write off the possibility of unverified or unverifiable phenomena you can acknowledge that they are possible without insisting or acting as if they are true or trying to convince others that they are true 4 x research source agnostic theist is completely certain that there is a god or gods agnostic atheist is completely certain that there is no god or gods an agnostic theist believes there is a god or gods but doesn t claim to know it with certainty an agnostic atheist believes there is no god nor gods but doesn t claim to know it with certainty do not feel that you need to be anti religion to live without religion some atheists love to advertise their opinions and publicly debate believers while other atheists prefer to live peaceably within their means you have the right to live out your atheism in whichever way feels true to yourself but be aware of the consequences of your actions perhaps you will change someone s life and belief system for the better by debating their faith or perhaps you will come across as intolerant don t believe in a deity that simple no prayer no worship consider your stance on the following statements evolution exists and events occur based on coincidence and happenstance no man in the sky dictates your actions or the events around you fate and destiny are myths many atheists are still open to possibilities and acknowledge that there is a lot left to discover for example there was a time that we couldn t see germs and science had not even conceived of their existence that did not mean they didn t exist only that their existence had not yet been discovered and scientifically validated rational atheists are open to new scientific discoveries but reject god as an explanation for things they don t understand ask questions about the nature of being with regards to mortality most religions offer explanations that can be described as metaphysically dualistic that there exist two distinct spiritual realities not necessarily conforming to each other s laws of time and space e g heaven and earth materialism can leave some people feeling empty and spiritually ungrounded however atheism does not have to be such a bleak affair thinkers such as heidegger kierkegaard and sartre pioneered the existentialism movement in the early 1900s readdressing the spiritual void left by atheism and capitalist industrial society they presented a new way of looking at the human being as an animal that transcends his her animality through the capacity for free will consider that the essence of being can lie in making your own choices respecting the choices of others and avoiding being consumed by unwanted routines and commitments purposeful being can consist of transcending innovating and breaking the rules the essence of your existence is the ability to decide who and what you want to be you are free establish your own moral code you probably have a reasonable concept of right and wrong you know when you ve made a mistake you don t need to ask your deity to forgive you you can learn from your mistakes and grow as a person consider that you dictate your own morals your own practice and skills determine your success everything is on you it s up to you to decide what is immoral and act appropriately morals may stem from ancient human interactions the ability to treat others well paves the way for trust between members of a group and trust allows humans to accomplish complex collaborative tasks instead of one person going to hunt for food alone since he or she cannot trust others a proven record of trust allows a group to make a hunt far easier 5 x research source understand that atheism need not completely define your ideology you do not have to subscribe to any set of beliefs atheism is not dogma it is a way to practice thinking for yourself atheists hold a wide variety of beliefs and outlooks though the main overarching similarity is a lack of belief in a god or gods many atheists are secular humanists 6 x research source who believe in charity and helping others on the other hand many atheists are individualist objectivists who believe in fighting for individual goals some atheists are left wing liberals and others are right wing free market advocates there are many different ways in which you can build your ideology and atheism is merely one part of it the one thing that all atheists have in common is a disbelief in deities most atheists believe that the universe is ruled by purely natural laws that no supernatural force from beyond this plane sets events into motion beyond this you re free to decide which ideas are important and relevant to your life consider which elements of religion if any you want in your life perhaps you cannot bring yourself to believe in an omnipotent god but you love listening to uplifting gospel music perhaps you do not want to live by a set of religious codes but you still draw guidance and inspiration from scripture at the end of the day you are free to define yourself in any way that feels true being an atheist does not necessarily mean rejecting your roots but rather considering which beliefs if any are worth absorbing being an atheist can be tough depending on where you live you may deny beliefs which have been passed down through centuries and with which a majority of population agrees if you are having trouble reconciling your atheism with your friends family and culture try to find common ground moral philosophical ideological between yourself and those who share your roots it is okay to be uncertain if you do not feel ready to define yourself in such certain terms as theist or atheist take the time to think through your questions and come up with answers that bring you peace respect the beliefs of others 7 x research source let your rationality guide you but do not let it lead you astray following a religion does not make anyone superior nor does your atheism make you superior to anyone atheism has no dogma don t be fanatical when discussing your beliefs with others and try not to be pretentious it s fine to be passionate about your beliefs but there is no need to dismiss people for their methods of creating meaning an atheist respecting the beliefs of religious people is no different than a jewish person respecting a catholic s views remember that their views cannot be proved or disproved if someone attacks with their opinions you have every right to defend your decision consider however whether it will help either of you to argue about your difference in belief consider whether either of you is actually going to change his or her stance on the subject don t try to convert people to atheism atheism is not a religion it s the absence of any religion trying to proselytize or get people to change their minds about their beliefs makes you just as evangelistic as a religious person do not force your beliefs onto anyone not only will people be less likely to listen to aggressive dismissive rhetoric but you will risk falling into the same pattern of dogmatically skewed logic that many atheists claim to eschew 8 x research source if someone is going to lose their religion they will walk that path in their own time and through their own questioning ask yourself whether it is your place or prerogative to move the process along empathize try to see the similarities rather than the differences between yourself and religious people the world is filled with kind brilliant theists as well as kind brilliant atheists we are all human and we are all trying to make sense of our existence consider your own search for existential meaning perhaps through your exploration of atheism and perhaps through other channels and try to imagine how a religious person may have found similar peace through their own unique search be ready to explain your beliefs learn how to explain why you are atheist in case people ask atheism is often misunderstood and you may get questions from curious people be as polite and informative as possible and answer their questions as well as you can explain that it is not a belief but a conclusion that you have come to based on the available evidence in the world if you are probed further about your atheism it would be smart to bring up bertrand russell s celestial teapot idea and explain that it does not make sense to you to believe in something simply because mankind lacks the evidence to disprove its existence open yourself up to a rational two way discussion treat other people religious or otherwise as intelligent human beings who are worthy of your respect,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to explain or defend atheism,you gotta stand for something or you ll fall for anything remembering why we believe what we believe helps us keep actions in line with principles these are typical atheistic positions on the most common challenges,humans have a history of making up convenient explanations for things unknown for example some had thought the sun to be a living god others believed and a very small number still do the earth to be flat and the center of the universe in short explanations based on gods and heaven have been steadily replaced as new knowledge is gained history suggests that remaining mysteries will be sufficiently explained in terms of familiar and rational forces rather than by supernatural ones for example many people believe that a superior being created life while atheists believe that this is just another scientific phenomenon to which people have assigned a supernatural explanation people once believed that it was a choice between blind chance and a god creating living organisms therefore most educated people saw a need for a god we now know that the random process of dna mutation is coupled with the nonrandom process of natural selection an atheist might want to point out that the scientific consensus is that the big bang abiogenesis and evolution account for the beginning of the universe and the origin and diversity of life while this does not rule out the possibility of a god s guiding the development of life it does show that a god is not needed as an explanation for the origin of life explain that intelligent design a pseudoscientific term used by creationists is just the awe of new experience or of overwhelming complexity it is a poor argument for a god it is an argument from ignorance a god of the gaps argument and as the gaps are filled the god is gradually removed from the picture if a caveman were handed a modern camera he would not guess that it was a result of step by step gains in knowledge over a very long time it would seem inexplicable magical perhaps supernatural the gods must have made it may be a natural thought but it would be wrong while a caveman might imagine that a god created the camera out of nothing poof the camera would have been created through a number of steps out of simpler parts living organisms are also made of many parts that developed gradually through evolution a creationist may try to claim that the eye is an example of irreducible complexity but unlike evolutionary biologists who have an explanation creationists do not explain the mechanism that a god would use to create an eye clearly define faith or belief some people have faith that there is a god for some people the existence of a god is a given it can be automatically accepted like the fact that the sun will rise tomorrow this is a philosophical belief and is as yet untestable by science an example of another philosophical belief not testable by science is the belief that we are living in a world created by a supercomputer to deceive our five senses like in the matrix since we use our senses to observe the world around us and to do science there is no way for science to investigate such a belief so far all phenomena that have been explained e g lightning diseases the origin of the universe and life have had natural explanations rather than supernatural one so far a supernatural explanation has never won out supporting a supernatural explanation may be possible but it would be extremely difficult as all natural explanations would have to be first excluded an atheist does not have faith in a god like some other people an atheist argues that one must have a reason to believe in something before considering it point out that there are many gods any theist especially monotheists like christians reject all gods but their own you can point out that you simply reject one more god than they do this is a useful point to make if you are trying to get a theist to relate to understand your position but it s not so useful if your debate opponent knows what they re doing if they say why do you not believe in the lord you can respond with why don t you believe in thor or odin to some people these gods are just as real as your own recognize that religions abstract from their gods are important as social institutions people clearly have an innate affinity for stories akin to the popularity of movies plays legends novels and ballads our willingness to believe in well told stories even supernatural ones is a trait of human psychology religions influence behaviour through scripture and tradition presented with or without explanations evolutionary biologists have suggested that religion is either a result of the sophisticated human brain or was selected for due to a beneficial effect such as promoting cooperation among people clarify that to give up on a god does not mean you give up on morals atheists simply accept responsibility for the moral code by which they live their lives if you are feeling confrontational contrast this sharply to the practice of accepting the moral code of the bible following yahweh s commands without question regardless of what the commands are eg slaughtering women and children you may also wish to familiarise yourself with the euthyphro dilemma and other related rebuttals in order to question their moral foundation there are a variety of moral codes that an atheist can use and they tend to be easy to explain ask where did the god come from in response to where did the universe come from the main reason for positing a god is to explain where did life and the universe originate because they seem designed but positing a god just pushes the questions further away because how do we explain the existence of this god that just happens to have all of the power and answers it is just as difficult and substitutes one problem for another and leads to an infinite regress this line of thinking is of the sort of a hypothetical person happening upon a sandcastle on a beach and thinking that it would be silly to think that the waves built it it must have been a person but alas who built the person if a deity of unfathomable knowledge and power could just happen or just exist then why not take it a step back and consider that perhaps a universe of unfathomable beauty and complexity just happened,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to tell someone you re an atheist,a growing number of people are identifying as atheist in our society unfortunately some of them are met with hate and intolerance from people of religious faiths telling anyone that you are an atheist can be intimidating at first some people especially fear losing religious friends and family though this sometimes happens it is your right to choose how you live and to be open and honest about it,know what you want to say having your talking points planned out can be a huge help this will allow you to focus on the important parts of the conversation and get your message across to the other person if you need to practice in front of a mirror or write out your main points before the conversation 1 x research source an example of something you might say would be i know that the rest of the family is religious but i simply do not believe the same things practice with an open minded person some friends or family members will be more open and accepting than others these people make a good place to start when coming out as an atheist they are likely to have a positive and compassionate reaction this will build your confidence to approach your less open minded loved ones for example you might start by asking your uncle why is that you never go to church with everyone else keep in mind that it may not mean he is atheist at all but you can now steer the conversation in that direction by saying something like church is awkward for me because i am atheist if you have a friend or family member that is openly atheist it might be a good idea to have a conversation with them about how they came out communicate directly with loved ones first posting the information to facebook or telling a friend of a friend will almost surely lead to your loved ones finding out secondhand word travels fast and your closest connections will likely be upset by the fact that you didn t tell them yourself you should make time to talk to parents best friends siblings etc before coming out publicly 2 x research source saying something like i need to talk to you about something and i wanted you to hear it from me is a good way to start this conversation with a loved one naturally they will ask what it is and you can continue with i am an atheist failing to tell those closest to you may alienate them the task of telling them you are atheist can be challenging enough without added tension choose a good time and place to talk you want your loved ones to be in the right frame of mind to hear you out instead of just lashing out at you if you plan to tell your religious friends or family about your lack of belief you should do it in private with plenty of time to discuss the matter and at a time that they are in a good mood 3 x research source a good time and place to discuss this might be at a family dinner on the contrary it may be a bad idea to bring it up at your parent s workplace or even worse in their church use i statements coming out as an atheist can seem like a way to rebel or can come across as confrontational to the religious establishment in which you were raised or formerly identified make sure that you frame the conversation around your lack of religion and not the fact that you find the other person s belief to be wrong 4 x research source try saying things like i personally do not believe that god is real in place of things like believing in god is absolutely absurd there is no proof be prepared to answer questions people often ask about each other s beliefs and invite one another to religious gatherings you can either choose to dodge the questions or answer them there is no need to wear an atheist t shirt everywhere you go but if you are going to identify publicly as an atheist you have to come right out and say i am an atheist and be prepared for the conversation that follows 5 x research source saying something such as i am not religious and prefer not to discuss religion is a good way to end the conversation most of the time keep in mind that some people will still continue to ask you questions and you can still insist that you would prefer to talk about something else choose what you will share you may be asked a lot of questions sometimes this is out of genuine curiosity and others times it is an attempt to shame or convert you it is up to you what you disclose and to whom you disclose it 6 x research source if you are asked what religion you observe during a job interview you can easily redirect the question with something like i do not feel like my spirituality is relevant to this interview decide how to approach social media some people choose to post their religious beliefs or lack thereof on their profile others simply do not share the information still others post very deliberately about their atheism consider your standing in your profession and community and the degree to which you are willing to create controversy to post on social media that said it is a personal choice and there is no right or wrong decision 7 x research source remember that employers and future employers will have access to the information you share if you fear that being openly atheist will damage your career be careful about social media discuss the topic at work do this only if you feel comfortable there is no need to discuss the topic but it is also illegal to for anyone to discriminate against you for doing so the culture of your workplace will heavily affect how you approach this topic with co workers 8 x research source if the conversation does come up in an uncomfortable way it is usually best not to argue or debate with religious co workers instead say something like if you d like to discuss atheism more we can have coffee sometime but i am pretty busy right now try to keep an open mind and be respectful of others while you will experience some degree of intolerance or at least confusion for your atheist beliefs at times do not fuel the discrimination you do not have to partake or agree with someone else s point of view but it is no more your right to change their mind than it is their right to change yours be as open minded as you hope others will be and show respect for example if someone says bless you after you sneeze this is no reason to go on a rant about how you are an atheist and do not believe that there is a god to bless anyone a simple thank you will do if an acquaintance is genuinely interested in your views it is okay to discuss them just make sure to keep the conversation respectful on both ends end negative relationships most people will be able to come out as atheist with little more than a few tense conversations in some cases however your job may depend on your religion other times certain religions will excommunicate anyone who is a non believer you need to remove yourself from these situations by finding a new job and putting in a support system before coming out as atheist 9 x research source once you are ready to end judgemental relationships simply say something like i have a right to live my life as i see fit and i will no longer allow other people to decide what i believe or how i portray myself keep calm and do not fight or argue with the person say what you need to say and don t go back into that relationship build a support system having a support system is crucial to being happy in the case of being atheist it helps to have other atheists that can relate to your experiences as a non believer look for local atheist groups or join internet communities of atheists if you don t know any atheists personally 10 x research source it is nice to have a support system of other atheists but you can also rely on the support of your open minded friends and family anticipate some uncomfortable situations opening up as an atheist can do wonders for your happiness but you also have to respect the religions of others co workers family members and friends will not instantly convert when you come out and sometimes they will even be downright annoying in the interest of saving your soul be prepared to turn down invitations to church and other religious events and to be asked to explain your belief and reasons often though you do not have to oblige 11 x research source you can respectfully leave any conversation that makes you uncomfortable by saying something like excuse me i think i should be going now if someone is not respecting you it is best to get out of the situation rather than engage in an argument about spirituality,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to survive an argument with an atheist,although atheists and religious people can be lifelong friends opposing views on the subject of religion can sometimes cause heated disagreements or full blown arguments this guide will help you survive an argument with an atheist should you happen to have differing beliefs and ever find yourself in this kind of situation,be prepared the best way to survive an argument with another person who disagrees with you is to be ready to handle any barrage of questions that may be thrown at you be ready to state relevant facts and back these statements up to the best of your ability with further relevant information assess the belief and knowledge of your opponent before diving in are they atheist or agnostic hard or soft what made them choose to believe what they believe remember that many atheists were raised to be religious they have knowledge of religion and have chosen to reject it they may view your explanations as condescending get your facts straight a factual and logical approach is often used by someone who is trying to persuade you to accept their point of view do not fight fire with fire in doing so you are pleasing the opposing person because they enjoy the argument in the process of it happening listen to what they have to say eventually they will run out of ideas and you may use a caring approach towards the other person ask relevant questions as well as answer any the atheist might have a tactic an atheist might use is to start asking you questions that will generate a response that he wants he will then use this response in connection to future questions he will ask to prove an illogical point for example is god good yes who made everything god so god made satan yes if god is good then why did he make something evil if you are asked a question answer it but then immediately ask your own as soon as possible some questions include why do you feel the extensive need for proof be honest try to avoid saying anything that s pretentious such as suggesting that their atheism is a result of feeling that religion had failed them in someway in their past as this is unlikely to go down well with the other person admit that you don t claim to have evidence or proof that god exists but that your belief is based on faith if this is the case the other person is then far more likely to show you respect know often atheists will not be the ones to bring up the subject of religion to argue about it atheists discussing religion is usually in response to a theists trying to preach to them criticize them or pass judgment on them you respect their beliefs and respect the rights of others and they will treat you with respect try to keep an open mind if the atheist sparks a sense of logic or a questioning of faith in you don t resist this new found sense of the world and try to learn a bit more about it remember the golden rule if the other person is receptive to your beliefs then great but remember that they are most likely going to be annoyed consider their situation how would you feel if someone came up to you and tried to convert you to greek polytheism you d be annoyed by the nonsense of the person s arguments and that s exactly how atheists feel if the above steps don t help consider dropping the discussion argument altogether sometimes it s just not possible to reach a mutually agreeable point of view with someone else no matter how hard you try if you find that this is the case you are likely to find that changing the subject altogether is the best course of action as that way it ll help prevent further conflict and negative feelings on both sides,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to identify an atheist,the vast majority of people want to avoid offending other people and knowing what someone does or doesn t belive can help you not to be offensive it can be easy to know what some people belive lots of people display their beliefs by wearing certain clothing or jewellery some will use language that shows their faith and some openly pray or offer blessings identifying atheists can be more difficult an absence of any of the things that commonly show faith is an obvious start but not every person who worships a god advertises it if you want to know if someone is an atheist try these steps,remove your preconceptions atheist don t worship the devil they don t believe in any devils more than gods they aren t axe murderers and they don t want to get in the way of your religious practices with that said atheists can be very spiritual people seeking answers to the same great questions that you do the main difference is that they just don t happen to find those answers in any god s understand why you want to know if someone is an atheist you will have much better luck getting atheists to come out to you by showing that you re interested in a different worldview from yours if you show that you re trying to gain converts well you ll have worse luck understand that they are most easily identified by what they don t do some don t attend worship services although some still do for the community aspect of it most don t they might not celebrate purely religious holidays like easter but they might for traditions sake or to celebrate the time of year and a public holiday when someone is hurting they might say you re in my thoughts as opposed to you re in my prayers in general their behavior shows a marked absence of reliance on a higher power ask some questions about their life in general for clues if appropriate if you are often in social situations where small talk goes on you can ask subtle inoffensive questions that might reveal that someone has a religion or they don t for instance you could ask what are your plans for the weekend if they say they are going to church on sunday it s very unlikely they are an atheist you still shouldn t assume though around religious times of year such as diwali or christmas asking about plans for the holidays could reveal beliefs you can try to find out if someone is not an atheist by getting a group conversation going about where people were christened or baptised and lead it on to what they d want to do for their children you can ask about people s spouses if you think it s appropriate lots of people are happy to describe their wedding day theoretically the happiest day of their life those that got married in a religious service and still have that faith are likely to be identified as not atheist during a conversation like this understand that they tend to be skeptics in all areas of life it s likely that they take few things on blind faith but you might meet the rare atheist who believes in everything but a god on the other hand they are also comfortable with what they don t know with no way of knowing whether there is an afterlife for example they won t fill that void with something such as a deity if all else fails just ask but do so in a non loaded way whatever conclusions you come to remember you will only know if you ask you may work out someone is not christian and assume they are an atheist only to later find out they are jewish or muslim when they are offended by your kind offer of a ham sandwich when it comes to asking try something like you don t believe in god do you it s so much less confrontational than have you accepted jesus christ as your personal lord and savior,Philosophy-and-Religion

religion general religion lack of personal thought when you subscribe to a religion you substitute group think for focused independent thought instead of learning to discern truth on your own and formulate your own beliefs you re told what to believe fixed perspective by saying i am a catholic or i am a buddhist you rob yourself of spiritual depth perception and attach blinders that do not allow you to see all realities lack of power religions are authoritarian hierarchies where power is heaviest at the top and lightest at the bottom where the majority of believers are religions are very good at turning human beings into sheep they operate by eroding your trust in your own intellect and gradually convince you to put your trust into some external entity such as a deity or great book convincing you that without these you would be lost wasted time religions often dictate that you have to pray attend church and read religious texts regularly some people take this even further with memorization of religious texts or other time consuming activities forgo intelligence or become a hypocrite when you subscribe to an organized religion you have only two options you can forgo intelligence or you can become a hypocrite you either willingly believe everything decreed to you by the religion for example believing that the earth is only 6 000 years old or you can recognize that

religion born in india maybe you re a hindu born in tibet could be a buddhist if you were born somewhere else to some different set of circumstances do you think you still would have found your way to

telling everyone that will listen that islam has given more rights to women than any other religion certainly if by islam they mean qur anic islam the rights that it has given to women are impressive

genital mutilation cite authentic ahadith to support the practice muhammad encouraged it as he believed it was more pleasurable for the husband furthermore a review of muslim history will bring to light many areas in which qur anic teaching aside women continue to be subjected to diverse forms of oppression muslim societies in general appear to be far more concerned with trying to control women

how to look at theism vs atheism more logically,here is a way to think more logically about the theism versus atheism debate,consider the variety of religions it is difficult to credit any one religion as being true or any one god as being true when there have been so many throughout human history none appears to have any greater claim to being more credible or reliable than any other why christianity and not judaism why islam and not hinduism why monotheism and not polytheism every position has had its defenders all as ardent as those in other traditions they can t all be right but they can all be wrong too many gods think about the idea of perfection theists often claim that their gods are perfect beings they describe gods however in contradictory and incoherent ways numerous characteristics are attributed to their gods some of which are impossible and some combinations of which are impossible as described it s unlikely or impossible for these gods to exist this doesn t mean that no god could possibly exist just that the ones theists claim to believe in don t reflect upon the inconsistencies no religion is perfectly consistent when it comes to doctrines ideas and history every ideology philosophy and cultural tradition has inconsistencies and contradictions so this shouldn t be surprising but other ideologies and traditions aren t alleged to be divinely created or divinely sanctioned systems for following the wishes of a god the state of religion in the world today is more consistent with the premise that they are man made institutions try to figure out why supernatural beings are given human like natures a few cultures like ancient greece have postulated gods which appear to be as natural as human beings but in general gods are supernatural this means that they are fundamentally different from human beings or anything on earth despite this however theists consistently describe their gods in ways that make the supernatural appear almost mundane gods share so many characteristics with humans that it has been argued that gods were made in the image of man consider the nature of a god figure theism means believing in the existence of at least one god not that one necessarily cares much about any gods in practice though theists typically place a great deal of importance on their god and insist that it and what it wants are the most important things a person can be concerned with depending upon the nature of a god however this isn t necessarily true it s not obvious that the existence or desires of gods should matter to us consider the source of morality and immorality in most religions gods are supposed to be the source of all morality for most believers their religion represents an institution for promoting perfect morality in reality though religions are responsible for widespread immorality and gods have characteristics or histories which make them worse than the most vile human serial killer no one would tolerate such behavior on the part of a person but when with a god it all becomes laudable even an example to follow closely associated with taking action that should be considered immoral is the fact that there is so much evil in the world today if there are any gods why don t they act to eliminate it the absence of substantive action against evil would be consistent with the existence of evil or at least indifferent gods which is not impossible but few people believe in such gods most claim that their gods are loving and powerful the suffering on earth makes their existence implausible look at the role of faith a common characteristic of both theism and religion is their reliance on faith belief in the existence of god and in the truth of religious doctrines is neither founded upon nor defended by logic reason evidence or science instead people are supposed to have faith a position they wouldn t consciously adopt with just about any other issue faith though is an unreliable guide to reality or means for acquiring knowledge think about what life really consists of most religions say that life is much more than the flesh and matter we see around us in addition there is supposed to be some sort of spiritual or supernatural realm behind it all and that our true selves is spiritual not material all evidence though points to life being a purely natural phenomenon all evidence indicates that who we really are our selves is material and dependent upon the workings of the brain if this is so religious and theistic doctrines are wrong work out whether you can find reasons for belief perhaps the most basic reason for not believing in any gods is the absence of good reasons for doing so the above are decent reasons for not believing and for questioning and eventually leaving whatever theistic and religious beliefs a person might have had in the past once a person gets beyond the bias in favor of belief though they may realize something critical the burden of support lies with those claiming that belief is rational and or necessary believers fail to meet this burden though and thus fail to provide good reasons to accept their claims,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to deal with ignorance with regard to atheism,if you are atheist it can be difficult to deal with the proportion of theists who may be intolerant and most often ignorant of the intricacies of your position often wild assumptions and keenly over complicated accusations of being closed minded are rife this article will look into how you can deal with the irritation and frustration this can bring and help you reach a level of mutual understanding with the people in question,stop ignorance is a lack of knowledge being ignorant does not mean intentions are malevolent see an encounter with an ignorant person as an opportunity to educate and open a meaningful dialogue bringing with it mutual respect and understanding ensure you know your stuff though most of the 40 000 religions throughout recorded human history are built on the same premises merely dressed differently it s important to know exactly what the people you are dealing with actually believe read about all the major religions and investigate whatever reasons the followers of these particular religions use to justify their beliefs this will not only enhance your performance in a debate but squelch any ignorance and misconceptions you yourself hold explain why you do not believe in a deity atheism is not a dogmatic institution you clearly have your reasons for being atheist nor is atheism a belief it is merely a lack of belief ask a theist why they do not believe in helios or omniscient shoe soles on saturn or why they are a follower of one religion over another describe why a possibility does not equal a reality explain that the reason they don t believe in pixies unicorns helios and a god of another religion is the same reason you don t believe in their god explain how you don t need the virtue of faith to justify your position a lot of theists pride themselves on their ability to have faith euphemism for believing in something you have no reason to explain how the universe can be explained without god and why god is not a necessary entity explain how reason is the way a human brain works naturally and stepping out of this constraint and residing independent of what you can observe is absurd ask yourself what is the meaning of all of this most of the religions in circulation today have archaic roots it only takes a look up at the night s sky to realise the scale of the universe our planet is not even a mote of dust in all this and we have some people arrogant enough to propose they know the meaning should there even be any of it all despite the fact that all human understanding is taken from this mote of dust explain that you humbly accept our relative ignorance as a species on a scale of the entire universe and choose to contribute to the objective search for a real answer through scientific inquiry reason logic and humanistic ideals rise above rhetoric it s possible that the person will resort to flinging claims out that appraise their cycle of faith accusations such as you being the devil or corrupting may pop up if it gets too heavy bring the conversation down a notch and calmly detail the fallacies with their accusation do not get angry or resort to insults remember the goal your goal should not be to deconvert the theist your intention should only be to educate them with regard to why you are atheist in some societies atheism is an enigma largely unheard of and unjustly vilified in isolation from the larger world it s hard to deal with a person who s only seen one way of life take it easy accept that you can t win them all for some people ignorance is comforting and they will choose to reside in it they will assert that you are a satanist or an enemy of god or make ridiculous generalizations they are sure of if you discern a person like this just leave them be because you are wasting your time reach a happy ending ideally you will both learn a bit about each other s position and come to some degree of tolerance take note you don t have to respect each other s belief lack of belief it s merely important that you tolerate and accept that you hold different positions don t treat such an encounter as a means to an end and don t feel disappointed if you don t fully agree with each other by the end,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to lead a successful youth ministry,youth ministries are often the pillar of any christian church s continuity if you can t set teenage hearts on fire with love of god they may go on to lead less fulfilling lives or worse be tempted into sinful ways this being a difficult time in most teenagers lives it is more important than ever to get a good youth ministry program started see more information on how after the jump it is important to raise youth that are absolutely sold out to god youth who are incredibly unstoppable in every aspect of life,find a good meeting location many churches already have a great hall for their youth group but if not find some location where everyone will feel comfortable a large room a park in good weather or the beach in the summer are great places for teenagers to connect get the word out word of mouth works great so encourage frequent members to talk to their friends about the youth group place an announcement in the church newsletter and sunday bulletin if the church has a website add a link for youth ministry information don t forget facebook and twitter as these are very popular with youth break the ice for a lot of these kids the youth group will evolve into their greatest friends base and that s a wonderful thing if you can get it to happen play some get to know you games encourage group discussion and mingling get the teens out of their pre set cliques make sure there are no teens left out or uncomfortable let the youth lead the youth know what the youth want often it s best to pick 11th or 12th graders to form a core or leadership team to plan events and the like at this age they ll have developed maturity planning skills and hopefully a sincere love of god sing praise to the lord youth love music and if you can find the right kind of music even the quiet type will open up eventually set a mood and use song as prayer those who aren t willing to sing under most circumstances tend to find themselves singing with joy when the holy spirit acts through them if you re a youth push to effect these changes many youth groups are stagnant because the youth just don t care love of god is contagious so let yours show for the benefit of those around you sign up for or plan your own retreats away from the hustle of routine life retreats can truly cause amazing spiritual conversions and encourage youth to attend the regular meetings as well pray for the youth of christianity daily there is perhaps no more important thing to do for your youth ministry than this,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to welcome a church visitor,churches should be welcoming places where new visitors feel free to explore and meet new friends because it s been a while since many of us have been first timers some congregations have forgotten some basic ways of putting yourself into the shoes of visitors and how to make them feel welcome by learning to welcome new members and introduce them to your church you can make the experience memorable and avoid some common mistakes that turn off prospective members,appoint specific greeters for visitors the welcoming process should start for visitors as soon as they park in the parking lot going to church can be an intimidating experience for a lot of people so you want to make sure first timers feel as welcome as possible for this reason it s common for churches to have greeters posted out in the parking lot making sure that new visitors have some idea of where they should be and don t get scared off before they even make it into the building choose especially warm and friendly church members for this job it can be an excellent way of giving particularly bubbly young members something to do before the service or letting senior members feel valued make sure the greeters avoid accusatory or unwelcoming language like what are you doing here or what do you need instead just assume that everyone s in the right place say hey there welcome how re you doing today listen and help out introduce yourself don t put the pressure on the visitors to introduce themselves and make the first contact visitors should be comfortable to relax and to sit back if they want to or to have conversations and make friends if they re interested take the pressure off by introducing yourself and your family and getting the names of the visitors treat the visitors as people not as visitors no one wants to go somewhere looking to be welcomed and instead be made to feel strange or in a separate category ask them questions and learn about the visitors to make them feel welcomed look for common ground to discuss and help them to feel as if the visitors belong show visitors around many church members forget what it s like to visit a church for the first time most first time visitors aren t interested in deep matters of doctrine and the content of the sermons they re just looking to find out where to park and where to sit and listen they just want to feel welcome slow down and focus on helping visitors get comfortable and make the experience easy and stress free make sure visitors know where they can park where to get a quick cup of coffee and where to hang their coat get a pamphlet that outlines the service for the day and be available for any questions 1 x research source give a quick tour of the building if time permits show visitors the room where the service will take place and any other attractive facilities if they seem interested some back story about the history of the congregation can be interesting for new visitors be friendly say hi to people let visitors know how they can join without pressuring them to do so many churches have different procedures and steps involved in joining the church and you shouldn t assume that all visitors will know how to sign up or whether or not they even should ask for information make it available to guests but don t make it mandatory and don t force it ask visitors if they re interested in information by asking questions and finding out what they re looking for if someone s visiting because they re in town staying with relatives and live out of state there s not much point in forcing materials on them make them feel welcomed but don t worry about selling them on the church this can be a tricky step in welcoming visitors because you don t want to assume every visitor is interested but the easiest way to engage is usually to get visitors to sign the guest book so you can have their contact information to follow up later recognize when to back off everyone is different and some guests might just want to enjoy the sermon and be left alone if they have an enjoyable experience they ll come back and you can get to know them a bit more later don t assume that standoffish or silent guests are displeased or uncomfortable they may just be looking to sneak in for a quiet service recognize visitors who may tend toward this and back off make contact and introduce yourself so they ll have a name in case they want to ask questions and learn more 2 x research source have genuine conversations greeters should practice their active listening skills and engage in real genuine interactions with first time visitors open yourselves up to the new people and help them to feel welcome by showing an interest in where they come from what they re looking for and who they are learn visitors names and remember them help visitors connect with people perhaps the most effective way to make a new visitor feel welcomed is to help them form bonds with regular members one of the main reasons why people feel intimidated at a new church is because they don t know anyone that fear quickly disappears when they ve made new relationships with others so do your best to help that process along new visitors to a church should always meet the pastor before they leave if they re interested make an introduction after the sermon if the visitors aren t interested don t force it invite new visitors to sit with you after introducing yourself invite the new visitors to sit with you and your family so they ll feel welcome as if they ve already made a friend at the church looking at a crowded church auditorium for the first time can be intimidating for new visitors but if you give them one less thing to stress about the experience will be much better for guests provide childcare during the service many larger churches will have childcare services in place during the service so it s a good idea to make this available to first time visitors and help facilitate the process if they re interested and have children it can be an embarrassing thing to ask and some visitors may not even be aware of the service if visitors are uncomfortable leaving their children in a nursery at a church they ve never visited before that s not unreasonable even if it s uncommon try to accommodate new guests as much as possible invite new visitors to church programs and events sunday morning bible study classes and weekly church get togethers are great events to which you should invite new visitors you can also invite them to upcoming one time events such as a weekend picnic or a holiday pageant make them feel welcome and informed invite visitors out for a meal or other after church gathering if after church potlucks or other get togethers are common at your church make visitors feel welcome by inviting them and including them in the festivities as if they were a member even informal get togethers at the buffet down the road can give guests a feel for the congregation and a sense of welcome it may be just what they re looking for follow up send a follow up note to visitors if you collect their contact information from the guest book you don t need to automatically sign them up for weekly church newsletters and bulletins but sending a short note expressing how much you enjoyed meeting the visitors would be a wonderful way of inviting them back to the church don t pressure visitors into joining right away even if you find out that visitors are looking for a new church and are considering joining don t jump the gun by thrusting a bunch of paperwork in their face five minutes after they hung up a coat focus on making the experience pleasant and stress free for the visitors and let them make the decision to become a member or not make yourself available for questions and help but it should be their decision don t seat visitors in the front row making a big deal out of new visitors is generally discouraged no one wants to be made to feel like some kind of zoo animal their first time in church with a bunch of strangers don t make it worse by seating them right in the front row for everyone to gawk 3 x research source don t make visitors introduce themselves forcing visitors to get up in front of a room full of strangers and talk about themselves is a good way to send them running try not to make any visitors stand up and talk for any length of time even if you re intending to make them feel welcome if you feel the need to acknowledge it say something general like it s good to see new faces today but don t draw too much attention to people and make them feel uncomfortable at the same time some visitors may be very talkative and have things to share encourage them to do so enthusiastically if they show an interest prayer requests and other opportunities to contribute should be available to visitors don t have ushers or deacons out visitors some churches will have ushers walk around during the service to take attendance and to note any visitors that may have been missed as a way of targeting them later after the service try not to make visitors feel like impostors that are having their id checked by the cops if visitors just want to sneak in and leave afterward they should be free to do so don t organize a welcoming song hard to believe but some churches organize semi complciated welcoming rituals involving a welcome song when new visitors attend talk about awkward avoid this practice never have specific visitor seating it makes visitors feel unwelcome,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to begin a children s ministry,if you re keen to start a children s ministry or restart an old children s ministry you ll need to have a mission statement that encompasses your ministry and some members to help you to carry out the project this article suggests some ways to go about creating a children s ministry,the church board should interview several candidates for a children s ministry leader they will help the board make decisions about the rest of the committee members coordinators with different responsibilities and lead these members together the church board and children s ministry leader should create a mission your mission statement is a written piece of paper setting out what your children s ministry is out to do it provides evidence of what your children s ministry promises to do and what it will not do remember to hand out your mission keep the original and copy it to give out to all of the people in your church before the children s ministry takes off here is a sample of a mission we the children s ministry committee have set out to do christ s will by planting the seed of faith and creating an environment where it may continue to grow we will do our best to serve the lord as he has called us to knowing that he creates faith and has created everything we will do our best to accommodate your needs we cannot promise that everything will turn out as you please but we must make all of our decisions for the benefit of the whole congregation every child is disciplined and guided in their faith and parents are educated to raise their children in christ as they are the ones responsible for this not the church we are set out to keep everyone safe and healthy as this as our priority join us as we carry out christ s will for us based on this mission create a theme logo and slogan for your ministry include the logo and slogan on all advertising materials forms and handouts this step may be done before or after you create a children s ministry committee this group of people should also decide on the ages of children who will be accommodated with this program many cap it at elementary age kids through fifth grade while this may make sense for many churches many sixth graders are too young for youth group and it may be best to wait another year before transitioning them as they are going through enough change regarding middle school already there is also a possibility of creating a junior youth group for kids in fifth through eighth grade with both mixed age and age graded activities typically separate by grade as kids may be more familiar with and relate better than with someone who is their same age but a year behind them gather a committee look for possible people in the congregation to recruit the ideal minimum number for people in the committee is seven however it may be possible to condense or expand the positions based on church size positions may need to be doubled or even tripled with the help of various volunteers the church board and an assistant children s ministry leader one person may be able to take on coordinating all programs a committee may consist of one person for the nursery and new parents of these children one person for sunday programs one special events coordinator this includes vacation bible school if you choose to hold one one special needs adviser and coordinator on tips for creating your ministry special needs friendly this person should preferably be an experienced professional one person to be in charge of training all volunteers in your children s ministry and educating and providing for parents this could be made into two positions and one person who is the leader of it all along with the vice children s ministry leader having a vice leader is a good idea so one person can take over if something happens to the leader and take over to give the leader a break each year otherwise they can be a much needed assistant to the children s ministry leader the committee is then formed by the minimum six people in charge of children s ministries remember that more or fewer coordinators may be needed depending on the size of the church there may need to be two or three of each of the positions the church board along with the children s ministry leader should interview possible candidates for the committee these may or may not be paid positions once your committee is assembled schedule your first meeting talk about fundraising ideas what else will go into your main programs besides what the church board has already decided building or facility renovation plans supplies needed and advertising ideas remember to try to make your ministry special needs friendly but create a room for children to retreat to if they ve had enough and be prepared to have special programming if necessary the special needs adviser should be responsible for this create a vision do this with the committee s help a vision is a typed paper with all of your goals based on these goals you can choose activities events and other tools that will help you get closer to your goal remember that god is in control and you can only do what he has called you to create this vision with him in mind writing what you feel he wants your ministry to be here is a sample imagine a children s ministry facility that sends kids running to the church it is unique child friendly and immaculate all surfaces and toys are regularly cleaned and an updated security system gives parents complete peace of mind when dropping off their kids there is a nursery full of infants toddlers and fully certified volunteers the children are being taught and know that jesus loves them and cares about them laughter and small voices fill the air as well as a worker s calm and comforting voice an updated bulletin board is in full view all children have name tags and a parent is given a pager in case they re needed before class is over the older kids rooms are filled to the brim with children volunteers are pouring into the ministry excited to serve in the ways god has called them to jaw dropping experiments are performed active games get everyone moving and learning the point bible stories are experienced and applied in unique ways arts help visual learners connect to the point and kids are allowed to get messy and be loud they know however when to quiet down and they pray whole heartedly worship is both loud and quiet but kids are praising god with all their hearts everything points back to jesus kids are remembering the weekly point and applying it to their lives and coming back every single week parents are being successfully reached with tools and information on how to raise their children in christ there is a successful vacation bible school program in the summer children gather with joy and adults are right with them family fall events are held as well as easter and christmas celebrations early on in the season to remind all of the reason for the holidays and christian summer programs bring it all together raise funds and advertise read how to fundraise for instructions and ideas remember not to pressure people into giving nobody appreciates this and the person may need the money for something else in the bible 2 corinthians 9 7 says each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver it is sinful wrong to cause another to sin including by pressuring them into giving so that they give without a joyful heart advertise everywhere make sure that your whole town city knows about your ministry include fundraising information such as where to donate and who to contact for more information here are some ideas for ways to get the word spread around create a bulletin board in your church s main hallway use children s hand prints or a border that has to do with your theme or logo staple your theme and logo to the top of the bulletin board and write papers about children s ministry events and items that need donated you can also try putting a paper rocket ship with the number of days left on a chalkboard hand out brochures in your brochures write about what programs your ministry will offer your children s ministries mission and vision and pictures hand these out all over town and at your church make a website if your church already has a website consider putting the link to your children s ministry s website on your website write a full description of each part of your children s ministry including the church nursery your mission your vision sunday programs vacation bible school training events and certifications volunteers must do special events and any other parts of your children s ministry create a page for each different part of your ministry be colorful make sure all pictures and videos are in color and add colors to your words such as red words for one page rainbow with all colors on another page and so on color is pretty and appealing to the eye include pictures take pictures of each room in your facility once it is complete you may use realistic architectural drawings before it is complete you don t need to take pictures of the storage room or the training room just the main places children and adults will be welcome in make sure that the rooms look colorful neat and appealing in each picture it s best to keep the rooms like this always not just for pictures time as time goes on take pictures of children doing activities and playing games just be sure to ask parents if their children s pictures may go on the children s ministry s website upload videos record training outlines for volunteers to review and parents to see what volunteers are being taught putting slideshows of programs such as a special event or vbs is a great thing to place on your website always include your logo and slogan and contact information the home page should include this and having each page include this is even better try adding clip art attach pictures of symbols of nursery or vbs come up with a theme for each of the facility s rooms or use your ministry s main theme throughout your facility such as kid s street walking down the street of life with god here are some ideas for both individual rooms and entire facilities create a kid s street use black and yellow paint to create a road on the ground and use chalkboard paint on the side to create a sidewalk kids can draw on with sidewalk chalk if money allows create play buildings that kids can play in or participate in different activities in for example toddlers preschoolers and kids in kindergarten and first grade would enjoy buildings themed like a grocery store veterinarian s office doctor s office church school daycare home restaurant or other places around town include age appropriate themed props and toys within these play buildings kids would enjoy having green carpet and pretend leaves or snow to rake or shovel and a pretend lawnmower to mow the grass pretend and real flowers would be fun buildings could also be used as stations during class groups of appropriately mixed age kids could travel to the art building then the bible times building the science building quiet time building for discussing the day s point and how to apply it to your life prayer personal time with god and various quiet activities worship building real life building for practice applying the bible to real life situations active building messy building grow with god through messy fun a sensory building complete with sensory room technology especially for kids with sensory processing disorder or for those who just want a break this room should have a mandatory whisper to yourself or otherwise be silent policy to accommodate the needs of others and social building for letting kids have a relaxed time to grow with others letting kids choose what building they d like to go to after the bible times real life quiet time and worship building will help tailor the message to a child s strengths and interests just make sure that kids aren t allowed to stay at the social building for too long but that they have time to learn about god as well clouds painted on the ceiling will create a nice touch create a barnyard room for young ones paint farm animals on the walls and attach textures such as cotton on the sheep fake grass on the bottom of the wall a hairy horse feathers on a rooster etc also turn a corner of your classroom into the barnyard corner provide farm books farm animal stuffed animals and plastic figures a sensory table with mud and plastic pigs a little kiddie pool with paper fish and real nets to catch the fish another option is to have a tub of soapy water and old clothes to pretend to wash and barnyard dress up clothes with a full length mirror you may need to block this area off during class time create an ocean room paint the walls blue and let children paint ocean animals on to the walls have a fish tank in your classroom with eels fish starfish and plants if this is a classroom for younger children provide a sand table with buckets and shovels or a water table with plastic ocean creatures this would also be a great place for a ball pit full of different shades of blue and white balls another room idea is a tree house room paint trees and forest scenes on the walls place stuffed forest animals such as squirrels around the room having a loft in the room that is named the tree house with a ladder to make it child accessible will send the excitement through the roof keep your ministry on the cutting edge using donations try to create play spaces indoor and outdoor playgrounds swimming pools this idea would take plenty of money precautions work and parental and children s permission so maybe don t make this your first play space attraction but keep it in mind for the future climbing walls ball pits bouncy castles foam play spaces paintings popping out of the walls interactive lighting and more create excitement in kids and make them want to come back consider hiring a professional children s venue creator decorator spend what you can and use low cost ideas for decorating found above and below otherwise your ministry s main attraction should be available to everyone of all ages this will peak interest in your ministry and let guests check it out allow families to spend quality time together and let older children and adults have fun and be kids again if however a church would like to create a separate or blocked off area for young children and the adults responsible for them that is fine this creates an age appropriate area designed especially for young ones where they can get away from the craziness and not feel overwhelmed by older kids smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb 4 45 begin a children 27s ministry step 5 jpg v4 460px begin a children 27s ministry step 5 jpg bigurl images thumb 4 45 begin a

enable you to have an effective ministry you can encourage charitable giving by learning how to educate your congregation being transparent and creating diverse giving opportunities,express the church s financial need for charitable giving members may not be aware of how a church financially functions so be explicit about what is needed and how the church uses given funds to meet those needs

donations would go if so provide a balance of the input and output of that fund to your congregation were you able to do something additional or extra special because of the excess donations share

x research source have a stack of envelopes available near where the weekly bulletins are stacked if you have pews put a few envelopes in front of each seat on a weekly basis you can purchase envelopes specifically for church giving at church supply stores or online have a secure box for envelopes to be deposited into make sure this box locks and that when it is emptied there are two

how to break growth barriers in your church,small churches almost always run into rigid growth barriers when they try to expand their congregations especially past the 200 400 and 800 attendee mark to break growth barriers you need to start thinking big redefine the church leadership and restructure the church as a whole to start matching the needs of a big church before the church actually expands in attendance,believe that god wants your church to grow if you want to break through the growth barriers at your church you need to firmly believe that god wants those barriers torn down before you can believe it though you also need to listen for god s voice and make sure that this sort of growth is his will for your church there are two systems of belief regarding church size the first states that god wants all churches to grow the second states that god has a need and a place for both large and small churches regardless of which camp you fall in if you want your church to grow you need to have confidence in the belief that breaking through these growth barriers is something god wants for your individual church develop conviction once you believe that god wants to grow your church you also need to have a firm conviction in your personal desire to see it grow the idea of growing your church can scare many church leaders into inactivity and complacency dissolving the barriers that prevent growth is hard work and the steps aren t often clear cut while the fear can be both strong and warranted if you let it control you you won t be able to get anything done once you make the decision to start growing your church you need to stick with it it shouldn t be your opinion that the church needs to grow it should be your conviction provide enough space as long as there are a few seats left each sunday you might think there s already plenty of room if your church reaches 70 percent of its seating capacity however visitors are less likely to show up and stick around 1 x research source determine how many seats you have in your main worship space and multiply that number by 0 7 compare that percentage with your average attendance from last month if your attendance is greater than 70 percent of your seating it s time to expand expand according to your resources you may need to move to a larger building or you might be able to build an addition onto your current one create more worship services when space gets tight and physically expanding is not an option the next best thing to do is to introduce a new worship service time 2 x research source understand that this alone may not fix your space issues even though it can help people are more likely to stick with the service they re already accustomed to so new worship times are often less crowded than the old times in a church with 120 regular attendees 100 may attend the old service while only 20 might switch to the new one hire more staff a larger church will require a larger staff it might seem sensible to wait until the church expands before you start the hiring process but it may actually be better to hire the people you hope to need beforehand finances may restrict the number of new staff members you can hire start with those positions that seem most crucial to your growth as a church as the finances start accumulating quickly hire more staff even if your long term budget projections aren t quite high enough yet study larger congregations in the area look to the large thriving churches in your region even if they belong to other denominations attend worship services there and speak with the pastor and staff 3 x research source once you find out what growing churches in your area are doing to break through the barriers you can adapt those same strategies to your own church you do not and should not copy these churches exactly but you can try to weave some of their ideas into your own church structure get your finances in order growing a church is an expensive business you need to have faith that god will provide financially but you also need to be a good steward of all financial resources that do come your way if no one among the church staff can handle finances in an expert manner someone new will need to be hired a full time finance officer is ideal but you can also check into contract financial consultants if doing so will be easier on your current budget prepare for growing pains during this growth period everyone from the pastor down to the newest member may have some difficulty adjusting to the change 4 x research source pastors often struggle to adapt to the feeling of having less control and less personal interaction members of the congregation may feel that their church is less of a home and may resist the changes going on as the church grows its leaders will need to prepare themselves for the changes that will come these leaders also need to be out among the members of the congregation encouraging them through the changes as well transform the pastor into a leader the pastor of a church must be able to lead the church in its growth this usually means that the pastor will have to grow along with the church it also means that he will need to shift himself into a leadership mindset the pastor needs to be both a minister and a leader ministry requires you to respond to others needs leadership requires you to take initiative without consulting others study up on topics related to the logistics of growth learn how to equip your church for ministry and how to raise money research time management and learn to balance your resources spend time reading on ministry related topics like theology church history and scriptures commit to a certain reading goal like a book every one or two months pastors can also benefit from attending conferences and meeting with mentors in the field of church leadership build a pastoral care team in a small church the pastor can run the business affairs of the church while still being there for every member of the congregation as the church grows however it will need to have a pastoral care team to help minister when the pastor cannot sometimes you ll need to hire assistant pastors to formally meet the pastoral needs of your church a pastoral care team may also consist of thriving lay ministries lay people of the congregation won t be able to help preach and teach but they can assist with worship visiting the sick and leading small groups 5 x research source stop micromanaging the governing board of your church needs to be geared toward managing a larger organization a board packed with members who fixate on the detailed organization of a small church will struggle to adapt to the needs of a large church 6 x research source when accepting people to the board keep in mind that they should be comfortable with larger budgets larger systems and larger staff numbers build new groups growing churches are very active churches and very active churches typically offer plenty of activities and groups for members and visitors to get involved with the groups don t need to be large and they don t even need to meet on church grounds the important thing is to vary the nature of the groups so that you can provide a little bit of everything have groups for different ages circumstances and interests organize based on the gifts of the people get to know your staff volunteers and congregation find out which skills and gifts the people of your church have to offer then develop programs around those attributes expand the worship service build the sort of worship service you want to need not the sort of service you need right now it s easier to draw in a larger crowd when you already have a service meant for one try to energize worship time or have more passionate preaching build the ambiance of excitement that you would expect to find in a larger church ask for feedback on the service look for ways to view the service through the eyes of both guests and regular attendees then tweak the service as needed turn your attention outward programs focused inwardly on current members of the congregation are important but if these programs vastly outnumber programs focused on the community you won t be able to draw new people from the community in encourage more outreach by teaching on relational evangelism and by telling stories about inviting people to church all members of the staff and congregation should be challenged to invite friends ask yourselves how to make ideas happen when someone suggests a new idea that can help grow the church the leadership needs to automatically begin thinking of ways to make it happen church leadership teams that immediately assume new ideas cannot happen lack vision and a church without vision will struggle to grow you should of course evaluate each new idea honestly those that honestly won t help the church should be set aside but those that are helpful yet difficult to accomplish should receive attention consider major events with caution some churches may plan one or two major events during the year to create community interest this can have a positive result but the result is often minimal at best attendance will usually spike for a few weeks after the event as time continues to pass however new visitors may lose interest and stop coming causing the numbers to drop back down major church events only work at breaking growth barriers when your church is structured in a way that can keep the interest going after drawing in that initial crowd,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to begin a new program or activity at your church,many churches have a leadership group church board presided over by the pastor who conducts meetings and services if you have a program or activity to get started at your church it probably will need clearing through this group here is a typical procedure how to select and implement a new program that you initiate but as the program grows then it will be the church that maintains the activity,think of a new program idea for instance whether to build a new church building do informal research among your acquaintances at the church see how many agree that this is needed or is a good idea get support for your program idea form an informal discussion but be careful not to include more than one church board member or this may be considered a meeting of the board excluding the pastor that will present immediate problems if the pastor is a strong minded supervisor of that church also regarding the pastor he she should not decide pro or con about such new programs without meeting with the board and having their support at least informally discussing it with key members and volunteers etc if funding is tight you may need to find ways to encourage giving in church select a strong inspirational leader who can advocate the program as a spokesperson and chairperson talk to the pastor if he likes your idea and the research that you have done then ask for a board meeting to discuss it and to schedule a church business meeting the rules of business of the church should be listed in the church constitution and by laws or similar document who is eligible to vote on business should be explained there also attend the whole church business meeting for the voting members of the congregation to discuss the idea of the new building program perhaps scheduled before an evening service time or after a day service time the members will be allowed to discuss the idea whether you need to move or build at present location or to find an area in which to buy land the members will decide when to make a motion when the discussion is finished and vote on the motion to build or to buy land or both if the idea is agreed upon then elect or appoint a finance committee and a building plan committee to learn about how to proceed and to present their findings later have a finance committee report at a church business meeting to explain the bond program ask for and take pledges of amounts that members will promise to donate monthly or in a lump sum to help pay off bonds have a presentation by an approved recommended church bond company that can handle issuing church bonds get volunteers to agree to sell bonds for free with no commission or pay have the building plan committee search for an existing church design of the size kind that your church likes ask about their design and engineering plans etc and request to buy or borrow a copy of those building plans for a relatively small donation to their church have a building plan committee meeting to present the plans to be voted upon expecting them to be accepted continue selling bonds using materials furnished by the bond company the interest rate is considerably better for the buyer than one can get at a bank the church has to pay these off with interest the bonds are for various numbers of years so that the investor can tie up their money for about as long as they like church board can proceed with the acquiring of the land if that will be needed have the church board select a general church building contractor who will hire the subcontractors and oversee purchasing materials and services for the construction have a ground breaking ceremony and begin the building process register the plans with the city building development and inspections department finish the building with proper procedures like using plumbers and electricians and getting inspections as required on various stages of the construction,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to follow customary behavior in church,every church and every denomination are different but there are some quick tricks which will help you feel more comfortable and fit in during a christian church service five or ten minutes of preparation at the church before the service can make a big difference,if this is your first time at a particular church or any church for that matter recognize that you are a guest and new to this it is normal to not do everything right the first or the second time in a new church many christian services are divided into two main components the first part of the service has to do with the word in other words the bible the second part of the service has to do with the table and usually involves eucharist communion identifying these two major divisions in a service can be very helpful if you feel completely lost in churches who do not celebrate communion it is just the word part that you will experience most sundays get to church 5 10 minutes early and sit quietly in the pew looking over the bulletin if possible make special note of which books are used by this church the bible a hymn book or two any extra books bulletin inserts look around and find all of the extra books or materials used during the service so that you can quickly grab them later you can even mark the first couple hymns in the hymnal for easy flipping later note any special instructions about standing or kneeling sometimes these are hard to catch as they are written in italics or boldface without clear directions identify how this church marks what the congregation is supposed to do if the only variation in movement is standing or sitting some churches will only have an asterisk or other symbol beside those items in the service during which the congregation stands it might be good to ask another person sitting close if it is not clear when you are supposed to stand kneel or walk around the church note that most of the standing and kneeling comes as a response to something in the service it might be a response to a reading or a prayer typically the order is for someone at the front to do something and then for the congregation to respond to what has been done note that if communion eucharist is being served carefully read the bulletin or ask someone close by how exactly it works in this church should you choose to go up during communion ask if they encourage a new person to do that and exactly how it would be done some churches only allow baptized persons or members to receive communion if this is the case you can hang back in the pew or you can walk up with everyone and indicate that you would like a blessing you can usually do this by crossing your arms in front of your chest following customary behavior takes practice attending a couple of times at the same church will make you feel like a pro unfortunately every church is different so trial and error is typically the way to know how to behave in a particular church try to relax know that you will feel self conscious and that while this is unintended it is normal try to enjoy the service as much as you are able to until you get used to everything going on wait a beat before you make any moves and try to follow others when you can,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to make your church warmer,going to church is a beautiful part of any christian s life sometimes however spiritual oneness can be waylaid by feeling cold to freezing in the large space of church especially in older buildings not fitted with warming devices given the financial constraints of many churches putting in central heating may not be an immediate option but there are things you can do,keep all external entrances and egresses shut during winter or on cold days all windows and doors that lead outdoors should be kept shut except those crucial for some ventilation line the pews use rugs or runners to line pews have the ladies group knit or sew such items as a defined project this can become quite an honor for those involved in creating the pew wear provide kneeling cushions to prevent knees on cold floors use kneeling cushions tapestry covered cushions are ideal but other less labor intensive versions will also do lay down rugs over cold floors this will help to stop damp from rising keep the congregation close together ask members of the congregation to fill the church from the front to back that way if there are not a lot of people at any one time they are at least at the front near the priest and they are generating warmth together install heat lamps above pews these can be obtained for a minimal cost and many are very energy efficient they can be switched on when the congregation is in attendance and they can be switched off at the close of service only those near people need be used to reduce heating costs hold a fundraiser to get money for central heating there are many different fundraisers you could think of with the purpose of heating the church consider more than heating fill gaps under doors and around windows seal cracks in the ceiling shut doors leading to internal rooms as well as these will only draw away the heat shut extra vents not a majority of vents so the back pressure doesn t hurt the heater in the back of the church on weeks there is no one to sit there there install ceiling fans to blow hot air down and mix it in rather than allowing it to accumulate at the roof and transfer heat out at a high rate near the ceiling ask the congregation to help with warming improvement projects this volunteer labor will reduce costs and will also raise ideas among the members of the congregation,Philosophy-and-Religion

hands are the devil s playthings if you keep yourself busy with good virtuous work or an assortment of hobbies you ll have less time to yourself and thus less time where you might feel the temptation to sin out of boredom devote yourself to your job or your studies by taking extra hours or signing up to be a tutor for instance spend time learning an instrument or a new language if you have lots of free time do anything you can to fill your time with activities that can help you grow closer to god or that make you a healthier richer or better person if you re struggling to think of things that you can do to occupy your time a good place to start is at a local homeless shelter crisis center or community outreach center talk to the management there s a good chance they can make use of your

to fight a temptation will even make the temptation temporarily stronger if you decide to resist your temptation to gorge on chocolate for instance you may start getting cravings after a day or two without it it takes time for temptations to fade some never do this doesn t mean that you re better off giving up fight your temptations tooth and nail don t quit even if you suffer setbacks or relapses the more persistently you fight the better chance you ll have of beating your temptation never reward yourself with sinful allowances or breaks resist the slippery slope of instant gratification this instant gratification can act deceitfully causing you to feel that it s not wrong although it is in god s eyes treat your temptations like bad habits that you must break work towards forming new good habits to replace your old ones by repeating good virtuous behavior over and over again accept that temptation is inevitable know that no matter how hard you strive it s impossible to live a life without temptations we will always at certain points feel a temptation to sin whether it s as innocuous as the urge to lie about our reason for being late to a meeting or as serious as the urge to strike someone who s insulted you it s also inevitable that we will give in to this urge at some point however it s possible through our efforts to reduce the hold that temptation has over us the fight against temptation is like waging a lifelong war be prepared to celebrate your victories and to learn from your defeats don t be discouraged by your own imperfection

scripture is full of stories teachings and proverbs we can draw upon when we re trying to avoid our sinful temptations the nature of sin and temptation is a frequent topic of discussion throughout the bible simply turn to a passage like romans 7 18 for an illuminating perspective on the difficulty of struggling against temptation for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not many of the most revered figures in the bible had intense struggles with temptation often marked with failure adam and eve committed the first sin by giving in to the temptation of eating the forbidden fruit king david one of the most important figures in biblical history had one of his soldiers killed so that he could give in to temptation and steal his wife reading the bible can help us understand how such great men and women struggled and overcame their temptation remember to trust god even when being tempted working through a particularly nasty temptation is hard work it s easy to lose hope and even to start to believe that god has abandoned us nothing could be further from the truth thoughts like life is hard so god must hate me aren t just wrong they re harmful when you re struggling with temptation god is pulling for you more than ever god wants to see you succeed he wants nothing more than for you to overcome your temptation so if god tests you don t lose your trust in him instead rise to his challenge follow the example set by the prophets they lived a life of purity and perfection he devoted his life to helping others he practiced nonviolence though he was willing to endure it he suffered temptations but he resisted them every time strive towards it ordinary humans can t achieve it but they can better themselves by trying the qur an praises muhammad and indeed you are of a great moral character qur an 68 4 9 x research source christians believe that through his mortal sacrifice we

how to be free from sin,in romans 6 18 the apostle paul writes you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness niv the concept of being free from sin can be a confusing one since all humans fall short of perfection and inevitably commit sins being free from sin doesn t mean that you ll never sin again but it does mean that your soul can be free of the captivity sin would otherwise hold it in,define sin in a broad sense sin refers to anything that falls short of the holiness of god the easiest to spot are usually actions but sins can also include thoughts and attitudes 1 x research source certain actions are considered sins but the desire to perform those actions is sinful as well for instance wanting to commit adultery is a sin just as actually committing adultery is temptation is not a sin though if you re put in a compromising situation with someone you find physically attractive you may feel tempted to act on that attraction actually acting on that attraction and committing adultery as a result or imagining the act of committing adultery even without doing it is the sin simply feeling tempted to do so is not accept the sinful nature of humanity even though mankind was created in the image of god the fall of adam and eve the first humans signified the fall of all humanity as a result humans are sinful by their very nature in other words you don t have to be taught how to sin sin is already firmly fixed inside of you at the very core of your being from the time of your birth understand the significance of christ s sacrifice when jesus died on the cross he carried the sins of humanity with him christ s sacrifice canceled out the debt of original sin in the old testament animal sacrifices were used as a way to repent for the sins of flesh even these sacrifices were imperfect though so the stain of original sin still remained as both son of god and son of man jesus became the perfect sacrifice capable of freeing the human soul from the chains and punishment of original sin know what it means to be free from sin accepting christ and being freed from sin does not mean that you will never do another wicked thing ever again christ s sacrifice freed your spirit from the shackles of sin your flesh including your body mind and heart will still have to deal with everyday sin your soul can be free from sin even though your body still sins being free from sin on a soul level should mean that you also seek freedom from sin on a physical level though even though it can never be permanently reached turn to christ as previously noted jesus saved the soul from the consequences of sin by sacrificing himself on the cross you must make a conscious decision to accept the offer of salvation before your soul can truly be free however if you haven t done so already ask christ to come into your life forgive your sins and set you free this is a crucial first step without relying on christ to free you from original sin you ll still be captive to sin in all its forms love god more than you love sin 2 x research source doing the right thing out of a sense of duty is legalism and it isn t what god wants god wants your love if you come to love god more than you love your sins and the temporary pleasures those sins bring you will naturally begin to shift away from your sinful nature focus on doing good works the works of the spirit before worrying about avoiding wicked works of the flesh when you fix your eyes on that which is good you are less likely to be drawn toward that which is evil when addressing a specific sin or temptation overcome that evil with something good for instance do something nice for someone you love instead of simply telling yourself to stop stewing in anger toward someone else acting on the impulse to do something good can distract you from an otherwise bad impulse to do bad more effectively than doing nothing would recognize the seriousness of your own sin 3 x research source habitual sins embed themselves into a person s life in a way that makes them difficult to acknowledge you may tell yourself that a particular sin is nothing more than a bad habit and as such isn t that serious breaking free from that sin and a lifestyle of sin can only happen once you acknowledge just how serious your own sins are all sin is evil and falls short of god s holiness this includes both the littlest lie and the most gruesome murder addiction support groups usually ask their members to begin by admitting to the addiction a person cannot fix a problem until he or she admits to having it in the same way you can only break away from sin by admitting to the sins you ve committed vow to resist sin in your heart promise god that you will intentionally avoid sin and seek good you will inevitably mess up sometimes but the intention to stay on the right path must be firm and true if you are unable to make this vow you may need to do some soul searching if your desire to resist sin still isn t sincere and that lack of sincerity is causing you to hesitate pray to god asking him to give you the right heart and mind to abandon your sinful lifestyle and turn to a life in the spirit embed the word of god in your mind one of the biggest powers you have against sin in your life is the word of god study the scriptures regularly your goal should be purity of understanding rather than mere memorization a thorough understanding of god s word can help you identify sin more readily and prepare for the temptations and traps that could lead you there moreover regular bible study can also strengthen your faith and make you more aware of god s promises as your understanding of god s love increases your desire to love the things that god loves will increase too making it easier to resist that which is wicked pray with sincerity and devotion ask god to guide your steps and help you avoid sin pray in this manner continually regardless of whether or not you are actively facing a present temptation prayer of all kind is a useful tool in the fight against sin even when you don t specifically pray for strength against temptation through prayer you can communicate with god which allows you to grow in your relationship with him as your love for god deepens your interest in sin will usually fade away more effectively watch for the movement of sin in your life every person has his or her own weak points and those weak points may vary from person to person identify your own by looking for signs of sin in your own actions and thoughts habitual sins are often the hardest to identify even though they re the ones you are most familiar with that being said you can usually spot them by looking for thoughts and actions that drive a wedge between you and god flee from temptation don t test your faith by intentionally putting your soul in harm s way when you see temptation lying ahead of you avoid it instead of confronting it ultimately the goal is to avoid sinning so any steps you can take to reach that goal are good steps to take to that end it is wiser to avoid the temptation to sin altogether when doing so is possible since confronting temptation only increases your risk of caving in for instance if you were preparing for a major exam and accidentally found a copy of the instructor s answer sheet holding onto that answer sheet for the duration of that exam will make you more likely to use it disposing of it or returning it to the instructor removes the temptation of cheating from you thereby guaranteeing that you won t do it walk alone and walk with others your commitment to a life free of sin must be a personal one mingling with people who can help you stay committed can be beneficial but you also need to be prepared to walk apart from the crowd following the crowd constantly will get you into trouble even if the crowd seems to be made of religious or well meaning people everyone is flawed you need to be able to see and follow the path that god has put in front of you regardless of whether or not anyone else is following it on the other hand spending time with people who share your beliefs can be a good thing because they can help keep you accountable you can also use these human relationships to enhance your understanding of god through discussion and acts of love repent immediately when you do sin repent immediately and with sincerity don t delay or waste time trying to justify your actions excuses to yourself and god will hinder your improvement even though your soul has already been freed from the chains of original sin you can only release your spirit and conscience of your own sins by taking them to god and asking for forgiveness in the midst of your repentance you should also ask for the strength to turn away from the same sin in the future refuse to give up no matter how many times you fall you need to pick yourself back up and keep trying the struggle against sin in your life is not a one time issue it s something you ll need to face throughout your entire life the good news is that it s a struggle you don t have to face alone god has freed your soul from sin and will not abandon you in your efforts to resist sin in the flesh the final victory belongs to god and as long as you cling to him you ll experience the benefit of that victory remind yourself of the reward waiting for you by regularly meditating on the promise of salvation that god has made to you sin can seem like a very appealing source of immediate satisfaction so thinking only of the present moment can make it difficult to resist sin shift your focus to the even greater source of satisfaction waiting for you in the future 4 x research source,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to trust and rely on jesus,do you trust jesus as your saviour this may seem like an easy question to answer when all is going well in your life but when times get tough can you still trust jesus of course you can it is important to know that you can tough times persecution and rejection are all mentioned by jesus as behaviour that we will experience as followers of him we have a saviour who will never leave us or forsake us it is us who most likely would turn away when times are good and feel as though we don t need a saviour,believe and confess with your mouth and you will be saved but the word believe means more than just believing this word believe is the closest word for the word pisteuo in the greek that the translators could find the difference is that the word in the greek means to trust and rely upon romans 10 consider this challenge a man strung a tight rope across the niagara falls and printed in the local paper that he would walk across the falls with a wheelbarrow full of rocks the day came and the crowd was big and excited about the event the man came out with his new wheelbarrow and asked how many of you believe that i can make it across the tight rope and back the crowd cheered loudly and said we believe you can do it the man went on his way with patience of steel made it to the other side and back with the wheelbarrow full of rocks the crowd thundered with cheers the man said how many of you believe i can push a man or woman in my wheelbarrow across and back the crowd got even more excited and cheered to see him take a person across niagara falls and back the man was excited about doing his last event the man said if you believe raise your hands the cheering crowd lifted their hands high and cheered he started asking for volunteers among them that believed to sit in his wheelbarrow to leave the safety and security of dry ground not surprisingly no one volunteered although many believed he could do it no one volunteered to sit in his wheelbarrow all the ones that believed and raised their hands said you are crazy i am not getting in that wheelbarrow many say they believe in christ but few choose to get into his wheelbarrow when christ asks you to trust me rely on me submit and depend on me will you surrender your life to him many are called but few are chosen check this you believe that there is one god you do well the devils also believe and tremble james 2 19 study this scripture because it shows that believing is not sufficient to get you saved if satan and his demons believe and understand that god exists does

how to deal with sin,dealing with sin can ultimately be a humbling and positive journey you can strive to stop sinning or deal with sin in someone else in an empathetic and forgiving manner don t expect perfection however double down in your commitment to deal with sin positively,understand what sin is and don t take it lightly many religions have definitions of sin and there are general societal norms for morality also that might vary from culture to culture in order to deal with sin it must first be identified and then acknowledged 1 x research source there are right and wrong reasons for everything and any coping method you use will be more effective if you are sincere about wanting to address the sin for example you ll find the process harder if you re only sorry you were caught ideally your reason would be along the lines of bettering yourself or pleasing god if you are religious 2 x research source sin is not a concept to take lightly if you want to live free from condemnation and at peace with yourself and others some sins can really hurt others and yourself be ever wary of these and don t minimize the damage that s been caused sin is often a selfish act if you find yourself doing something that hurts someone else but satisfies a want of yours that s probably a sin same if someone else is doing it if you are religious seek out a religious text like the bible or religious authorities and truly understand their definitions of sin while most people believe that sin is the bad stuff people do sin is much more than that in many religions sin is any deviation from the perfection wholeness completeness of god so while sins can be actions thoughts and attitudes can be sinful as well the root of sin is the human desire to put oneself ahead of others figure out why you or the other person has sinned sin doesn t exist in a vacuum people sin especially if it s habitual sin because of underlying problems or issues in many cases sin especially habitual sin is often the symptom of a much greater issue in a person s life examine your life what sins have you been committing what are the causes of these sins really dig deep and ask yourself the hard questions if the sin came from someone else help that person examine his or her life and the underlying reasons that might have led him or her to sin this can be much more effective than responding to sin with blame and anger 3 x research source lighten up on yourself or the other person understand that everyone can fall secondly we have to acknowledge that we don t have what it takes to defeat sin entirely this principle is key it will lead us to a humble life overflowing with gratitude don t ever dismiss yourself or another person as doomed to hell only god chooses that and as much as we think we understand what can get you there it is not our place one of the best ways to get over a sin is not to think too much about what you did but what you did not do if you already know how to correct your particular sin then simply do so it will be hard but do not give up giving up hope is by far the worst possible sin try to make up for the sin as inconspicuously as possible get help for the sin or encourage the other person to get help some sins such as addictions take other people to overcome and understand them find someone you trust to assist you and be cautious of mentioning your struggle around judgmental people overcoming sin isn t a shameful thing and you certainly don t need unnecessary negative input if it can be avoided find balance on one hand you don t want to ignore your sins as they can and will drag you down but on the other hand you need to not be too hard on yourself if you re doing your best you re on the right path talk to god if you are religious god isn t unapproachable although he does want to be treated with respect spend time every day for personal prayer and scripture study to study the scriptures you can either read it from front to back or you can use the topical guide to look up key words or phrases so long as you re sincerely paying attention to what you re reading there really isn t a wrong way to do it if you cannot stop yourself from committing a certain sin or a past sin seems to be taking over your life don t be too proud to seek help if you are not religious psychiatrists are not looking to expose you in any way and may be able to help you conquer your struggles help the sinner if the sinner comes to you but try to avoid scolding tell the sinner gently if you think what he or she did was wrong but there is usually no need to repeat yourself avoid overt judging words show the sinner what to do if they ask if you come on too heavy or mention hell to them it could damage the relationship if someone was injured or hurt as a result of the sin help that person if the sinner doesn t yet feel the need to repent avoid situations that might cause you or your family to get hurt by the other person help the sinner recognize what sin is you can subtly educate the sinner about how to repent without driving them away do this in a kind and helpful manner without using overt judging words or castigating the sinner instead explain what religious texts say about sin couch your comments in empathy let the sinner know how you see the sin harming them and others around them focus on the good you see in them and on the potential the sinner can realize forgive the sinner especially if they repent this may take time especially if they hurt you but you re not helping anyone by holding a grudge be open to restitution letting go of anger heals you first and foremost 4 x research source forgiveness doesn t mean that what they did was okay forgiveness is often for your own peace of mind don t judge don t be in any way cruel to the sinner because of his or her decisions the sinner is still a human being 5 x research source do not press matters as that will make it worse patience and respect are the best cures for another s sin wait for signs of improvement or lack thereof and respect that the other person would have just as hard a time as you would if not harder when the time comes and the person has made the first change congratulate the person calmly no parties for working towards the better admit that you ve sinned firstly you need to acknowledge that indeed you have sinned whether against yourself others or god the very fact you are asking the question means you recognize that something is amiss in your life this is most encouraging one of the most difficult things good people have to face is the fact that we all sin good people do not easily see that they in fact commit sin identify what the sin is ask for forgiveness this means admitting you did something wrong to the people you hurt if applicable and then confess it to god if you are religious life is hard we ve all had times when we ve done things we know we shouldn t have resolve not to do that wrong or sinful thing again if completely stopping the sin is not possible overnight resolve to do and be better god wants us to grow and be better but he understands that perfection is a process once you have done this and know in your heart you are forgiven you may make restitution where appropriate it is advisable to remain on your knees before god until you feel forgiven if that s your religious belief no

how to stop people from trying to convert you to another religion,people who spend their time trying to convert others to their own religious belief system are known as proselytizers 1 x research source while there may be a time and place that you are interested in hearing about the different religious beliefs of the world you may find it tiresome and annoying when a loved one a door to door proselytizer or someone on the street hassles you about your own beliefs telling you why theirs is the only true religion dealing with people like this can be tricky but with a little patience you can get them off your back without being too offensive,change the subject if this is the first time your loved one has tried to explain to you why your beliefs are wrong and theirs are right try changing the subject as gracefully as you can if they are perceptive they will realize that you aren t interested in this kind of conversation with them 2 x research source for example you could say that s really interesting grandma i need to go see if mom needs any help in the kitchen i ll be back in a minute and i want to tell you about a big project i m working on at school you could also be more direct and say grandma i know you really want me to convert to your religion but the truth is i m just not interested can we lay the subject to rest and enjoy our time together today bring up a really exciting movie that you have seen recently ask them if they d like something to drink or excuse yourself to the bathroom don t be defensive sometimes the problem with religious family members is that they have multiple attempts to try and show you the right way however if you want religion to not be an issue that comes up over and over then do your best to approach them lovingly 3 x research source if you behave defensively towards them it demonstrates to them that you are not secure in your own beliefs and that they may have a chance to change your mind when they tell you about how great their religion is say something like it sounds like you ve found something that really makes sense for you i m happy for you i ve also found a religion that really feels good for me this shows them that you support their belief but that you have different beliefs of your own without being defensive explain to them that you re not interested in changing for some it may be enough if politely explain that while you respect that they have their own beliefs yours are different and that you aren t interested in being changed 4 x research source you could say for example i think that it s admirable that your faith in insert religion is so strong i have my own religious beliefs and while it is good that you have your own different beliefs i m not interested in converting maybe we could talk about something else allow them to express their beliefs realize that there is a difference between a loved one simply talking about their own beliefs and trying to convert you try to recognize that sometimes they may simply be wanting to talk about a religious belief that is on their mind or something that they read in their holy book if they aren t telling you how they have the best religion in the world and then bashing your beliefs they probably aren t trying to convert you 5 x research source if your loved one seems as though they are just talking about their religion then don t shut them down you don t have to agree with them but you also don t have to make them feel as though religion is a taboo subject around you don t answer the door the easiest way to get someone who comes to your home to stop trying to convert you to their religion is to not answer the door you aren t obligated to answer the door to anyone the downside of doing this though is that they may try again another time look through the peephole to see who is knocking on your door before answering if you don t have a peephole try peeking out the window if they ring the bell and you aren t going to answer try to make it seem as though you aren t home turn the tv on mute and be as quiet as possible be polite if you do answer the door there is no reason to be rude and simply slam the door in their face you may not agree with their beliefs or their way of trying to convert you but being rude won t make the situation any more comfortable 6 x research source say hello how can i help you don t just open the door and say what do you want additionally being rude may only serve to make them feel as though they need to show you the way making them even more insistent allow them to initiate their speech they will usually begin by explaining who they are and what their religion is they will ask if they can come in to talk to you about their beliefs and why they should be your beliefs too letting them get their first bit out will make it seem less rude when you say you aren t interested and turn them away normally their introduction will only take a minute or two if they begin to rattle on for 5 minutes while standing outside their door then it s ok to interrupt them to explain that you re not interested explain that you are not interested do this politely explain that you are not interested in converting to their religion if you want to you can tell them what religion belief you follow but you don t have to 7 x research source for example you can say thanks for stopping by but i m not interested in converting to your religion i feel comfortable with my own beliefs and i d like to stick with them have a nice day try to avoid engaging in debate it may be tempting especially if you have strong beliefs of your own but if you want them to leave you alone engaging in conversation with them will not help you accomplish this remember that your visitors have strong beliefs which have led them to walk around town trying to save everyone it is unlikely that you can convince them of your own beliefs 8 x research source that said if you have time to waste and feel like engaging in debate there s no reason that you cannot do this just realize that this will take up a lot of your time and will likely lead nowhere realize that they probably won t give up right away people who go door to door are used to having people turn them down so they probably won t be phased by your explanation they may have counter arguments for why you should let them in to hear about all the ways their religion is the right one 9 x research source at this point you can become more firm in your insistence that you aren t interested tell them you have a lot of things to get done and although you appreciate their visit you have to go now close the door if the visitors continue to insist that you should hear them out you can either just close the door without saying anything or you can quickly make up an excuse and close the door without waiting for a response for example you can say i really have to get back to what i was doing bye or i m sorry i have something in the oven that i must check on have a nice day try to ignore them in public places you may often come across people who stand on a street corner preaching beliefs at passers by if they have not directly targeted you just keep walking try to avoid making eye contact with the person if they are simply preaching to whoever will listen they will seek out eye contact with people if you make eye contact they are more likely to approach you to keep the situation from being awkward you could take out your phone and pretend to be answering it talking or texting this may deter them from interrupting you this will also keep the situation from being awkward if they try to stop you as you can simply act like you didn t realize they were trying to gain your attention politely tell them you aren t interested you can try to explain that you aren t interested in converting or that you are very happy with your current set of beliefs be aware though that this is unlikely to deter them they likely have several arguments prepared against many different rationales 10 x research source for example you can say it seems like you really know about your religion and that s great however i am as convinced about my own religion as you are yours so i m not really interested in converting if you are interested in engaging in conversation with them then do so however don t expect that you can change their mind don t try to reason with them if they are standing outside talking to strangers they are probably quite convinced of what they believe trying to be rational about how everyone is entitled to different beliefs probably won t make much sense to them make up an excuse if the person has singled you out and is trying to tell you about why you should convert tell them you have an important meeting that you are about to be late for or that you are rushing to pick up your child younger sibling from school 11 x research source for example you can say i m sorry but my little brother is waiting for me to pick him up from school and he s all alone i can t hang around chatting anymore don t wait for a response it s possible but unlikely that the person will say something like ok have a nice day more likely is that they will ask you to hang on so they can give you a bunch of different pamphlets and other information on who you can get in touch with to learn more about their religion the easiest way to get out of it is to offer your excuse and then walk away quickly it may not be the most polite route but it will get you out of the situation walk away if the person persists and doesn t seem to be put off not matter what you say simply walk away realize that they may still say things to you as you walk away and they may even start to be rude ignore these things realize that you are under no obligation to stand around listening to something you aren t interested in hearing you may feel rude doing this but you should remember that they are being rude by trying to force you to stand around listening even though you have already tried to politely decline notify the authorities if the person seems to be acting unnecessarily aggressive towards you or towards others notify the police while it is not illegal in the usa to talk about your beliefs openly in public it is illegal to harass people 12 x research source if this person is threatening people or following them persistently even when they try to get away this is harassment if the person physically assaults you or someone else call 911 and inform them of the situation right away if you can try to get a picture of the person or video footage of the incident on your phone,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to avoid uncomfortable conversations about religion,whether you are religious or not if someone is trying to draw you into a conversation or perhaps an argument regarding religion you might feel the timing and situation is awkward and uncomfortable you might also simply not be interested in the discussion try changing the topic and if that doesn t work you can firmly end the conversation if you simply can t escape talking to the person about religion setting a few ground rules can make things bearable,redirect the topic subtly to be polite this is the most polite way to avoid the conversation about religion if someone brings it up follow up with something unrelated without being too obvious try to raise questions that lead the other person to talk about different things you appear interested in 1 x research source for example imagine cousin marty says something like kids these days just aren t going to church it s all that rock and roll they re listening to right you could follow up with speaking of kids i ve been meaning to ask how s your daughter doing at college bridge to a safe topic before religion is brought up if you know that you ll be talking to people who like to bring up religion take charge and steer the conversation elsewhere by being preemptive you can stop the awkward conversation before it even begins 2 x research source be prepared with a few neutral conversation starters like so what did you all think of the last game of thrones episode or anyone have travel plans for the summer whenever you re around the person who likes to talk about religion just lead with one of these neutral topics find someone to be a buffer bringing someone new into the conversation can lead to a natural shift in topic if someone won t drop the topic of religion having a buffer also means you won t be stuck alone in an awkward situation 3 x research source you can make the shift suddenly like hey isn t that pam over there let s catch up with her hey pam over here try to have a friend or ally be your buffer they ll probably pick up on what s going on and try to help out respond with total silence sometimes not saying anything at all is the best way to get a point across if someone brings up religion in an uncomfortable way look at them and say nothing it takes a little nerve but hold the silence for a few seconds and then shift to a neutral topic this should signal clearly that it s not an appropriate time to discuss religion 4 x research source make up an excuse to leave a little white lie is just fine if you re trying to get out of an awkward conversation about religion tell the person you ve had fun talking to them but you ve actually got to go now 5 x research source make up an excuse where the person can t reasonably follow you for instance if you say you re going to refill your drink they might try to follow you instead say you ve got to go call home and check on things try the hard pivot technique if someone makes an awkward or offensive remark about religion you don t have to respond in any way at all simply turn and walk away this might be considered rude but it s reasonable if it s really not the place or time to talk religion 6 x research source let stray remarks go rather than starting an argument if someone makes a religious comment even one that annoys you no one says you have to respond this is especially true if it seems like an awkward time to pick up the topic if there s not a question directed specifically at you just let the comment go leave as soon as you can 7 x research source declare a debate free zone if you can t escape the conversation and the person won t let the topic go be upfront about not wanting to talk politely but firmly remind them that religion is a personal and sensitive topic and it may not be appropriate to discuss it in all situations suggest that for the sake of others around you it s best not to debate religion right now 8 x research source suggest talking about religion some other time if the person is not being combative but wants to talk about religion tell them another time and place would be better if you are genuinely interested in talking to them about religion you can actually set up another time to talk if you just want them off your back keep it non specific 9 x research source something like why don t we talk about this at the next company picnic should do the trick agree to disagree with reasonable people this old standby actually works if someone brings up religion in an awkward situation tell them you likely don t agree on spiritual matters and should probably talk about something else 10 x research source,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to avoid cults that may try to convert you,a cult is a group of people who follow a similar ideology usually led by a charismatic leader many but not all cults can be dangerous mind controlling and potentially violent it s best to identify and stay away from cults to begin with avoid responding to door to door surveys and be careful about the groups that you join if you find yourself involved in cult you can retain some distance by reaching out to friends and family police and law enforcement authorities can also help if you feel unsafe 1 x research source,research the group online if you are being asked to join an organization don t immediately say yes instead spend a bit of time online researching the group s background history and any recent mentions pay attention to how the group determines membership and whether or not they seem more inclusive or exclusive be wary of groups that are relatively unknown or ones that take pride in their secretive status local news sites in particular may provide solid leads on which cults are currently active in your area look for one person who is in complete control most cults are organized around the whims and leadership of 1 or 2 central leaders these leaders are often charismatic and pride themselves on their ability to lure others into the cult watch out for leaders who set inflexible rules for the group and dispense severe punishments too 2 x research source a leader might also vocally claim to be the leader of the cult organization be wary of both small and large organizations most people assume that a cult needs to be a large organization with many members usually working under 1 leader however many cults are smaller in size and only grow slowly over time this makes law enforcement authorities less likely to notice them 3 x research source look for similarities in dress and overall appearance cults thrive on uniformity and that extends to how cult members look on a daily basis beware if a group demands that all members wear particular clothes they may also pressure members to cut or dye their hair so that everyone looks the same 4 x research source stay away from groups that preach about the dangers of outsiders cult members and their leaders will often act as if they hold the truth and everyone else is less worthy if you get the feeling that a group that you re in likes to exclude others then you may need to give yourself some distance some cults even pressure potential members to cut off all ties with close friends and family members for instance cult members might tell you that only they really care about you this can be a way to drive you away from your close support network push back against pressures to change your beliefs cults thrive on conformity and expect their members to think along the same lines if you express your thoughts about a subject and are met with hostility or pressured to change your mind then you might be dealing with a cult for example a cult leader might say you might have a future in our organization if you decide to believe be cautious when responding to surveys or donation requests many cults will get their members to approach you on the street in order to ask you to complete a quick survey or to solicit cash or goods donations they may also go door to door if you choose to participate be careful in what information you provide 5 x research source if you are interested ask for their contact information so that you can do some research before reaching out look for cults that pose as non threatening groups or clubs to avoid scaring potential new member away many cults will actually hide within a large organization or operate as a fairly common organization the key here is to watch if the group s expectations begin to change over time or if certain more radical members start to take control 6 x research source for example some cults pose as bible study groups or even volunteer organizations they may wait an extended time before revealing their true nature to individual members recognize if you are a target of love bombing this is when a cult focuses all of their attention and resources on persuading a particular person to join they might bombard you with affectionate gestures until you feel pressured to give in to their requests or demands they might also act as if you are central to the group even if you just barely know them 7 x research source for example they might give you lavish expensive gifts in order to show the rewards you can get from their group these gifts usually won t last after you ve given in ask lots of questions if something concerns you about an organization reach out to a leader or member and express your concerns watch to see how your questions are treated in most cults questions are belittled or ignored as they are believed to undermine the authority of the cult s leader for example you might ask about the group s leadership structure and if they ve ever considered following a voting or democratic system push back against increasing control cults thrive on being able to micro manage even the smallest aspects of member s lives they may want to tell you what to eat how to dress or even where to live if you recognize these signs then you may want to leave the group or you can try to go against these rules to see how the group reacts a cult leader might ask that you only dress in subdued colors such as pastels or they may strongly suggest that you grow your hair out to a certain length seek out emotional and mental support from your family and friends cults often prey upon the vulnerable they look for people who are undergoing major transitions in their lives such as leaving for college then they offer the illusion of stability and support when you are feeling vulnerable reach out and maintain close contact with your family and friends 8 x research source watch for drug abuse some cults use hallucinogenic drugs like lsd to supposedly tap into a higher level of being or consciousness this drug use may be limited to just the leader of the cult or the upper echelon members easy access to drugs can be another way that a cult can lure in members 9 x research source to convince you to use a drugs a cult member might say if you take this pill then you ll be able to relax and be a better member of the group contact the police if you are being harassed by a cult once they ve set their eyes on you joining a cult might not take kindly to you rejecting their offers if you feel as if you are in danger of if you are just concerned for your well being it s best to reach out to local law enforcement authorities you can tell them your concerns and ask for their advice and assistance 10 x research source,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to make your own luck,even if you don t think it s possible you have every opportunity to create your own luck being ready to seize opportunities when they present themselves is up to you it s not a paranormal occurrence anyone can take control of where s he is headed in life no matter his or her age or situation,be assertive and proactive if you don t walk your path no one else can or will do it for you why should they you can and must innovate create and do your stuff your way chance is involved in random luck but improving your luck is never about relying upon pure random chance venture this luck requires positive proactive effort and nurturing your ideas no venture no gain no input no processing no output no get up and go and not moving ideas up and outward to make or boost events to develop and happen then no luck avoid useless purposeless risks you can t control chance events but you can take action to improve your situation believe that things happen because of how you approach life believe in a goal write it down and make this your luck blueprint use the proverbial back of a napkin or scrap of paper even with the usual coffee stains whatever is available right now when preparing your blueprint consider the following title your blueprint make luck for ______ one of your areas of interest if it is messy that s fine as it ll take shape in time these ideas can seem like ordinary things or things that will be time consuming and difficult but that apply to your future luck needs in that area list ideas for your chosen goal and write down every big thing you can think of on that topic don t spend too much time on your plan right now you can take the time to polish it later copy your blueprint over to something more substantial later if you re using scrap paper put deadlines on your goals deadlines make daily progress more likely aim to make progress in little goals or short term goals be they hourly daily or weekly ones make your own action plan and follow through on it polish your plans as you go and try to remain open to new opportunities think of prerequisites this means the required order of your goals such as doing 101a before 102b if it matters this may require placing a number of your goals in a logical sequence write descriptions of the categories of your goals categories can work better than writing thousands of short term goals that don t seem to be linked consider adding smaller steps within each goal so you can see the linear process more clearly expect great lucky ideas to occur to you but do not worry if you re not inspired right now work through your doubts and muse and meditate about goal related matters be ready for new ideas as soon as inspiration hits find a way to write it down if you don t record it later you ll probably wonder what was that great idea if you do not focus on a reasonably dynamic idea to develop and to actualize then that kills this luck but if you have and believe in your ideas you can then make positive changes at many levels raise your expectations no matter where you are or where you d rather be you can move beyond simply existing pump up your goals any way that you can realize that lucky people focus on getting it done and go beyond simply making do don t wait without good reason recognize that perpetual procrastination until something better just comes along amounts to making excuses work smarter not harder use connections with other people to help accomplish your goals go beyond making an effort and shift into innovating and trying new ways to get things done partner up both bill gates and steve jobs had a technical expert as a startup partner partnering with someone who is able in areas where you are not relieves you of your own limitations and makes more room for your strengths to shine don t ever presume you need to create your luck alone others can be great support as you seek your luck just be sure to reciprocate in kind this isn t a one way sense of support be ready when opportunity arrives this is the real secret behind making the most of luck people spend a lot of time preparing themselves rather than simply sitting about hoping and it can take a lot of time initially seek new experiences when you know what will improve your life or the lives of others around you you create your own direction and strive forward with this sense of direction in place you can now seek and find what you re looking for pursuing your blueprint goals able to focus on what is in your plan path or way build up your experience for example gain the experience or expertise yourself through study and observation or speed things up by finding a mentor who can help guide you along the path you ve chosen someone with real world experience observe how others work without imposing on them creative people need some latitude and time to get ideas together and to get going be a good listener rely on using good humor and make time for relaxation together arguing with people who have as strong a vision or set of goals as you is inevitable so make room for agreement too and never be unreasonable in insisting on your own way flex but be sure to push for your worthy innovations and improvements be a self made genius for example to play several musical instruments realize that you must practice every day for years and never stop for thousands of hours the same may be true for academic talents devote yourself fully and recognize that true improvement takes time learn to do public speaking even if you don t stand before a crowd it can help you to become persuasive and get in shape in all areas that matter be positive believe in yourself don t say i never had talent people who think like that usually are wishful but didn t really try enough things or keep at them for long enough happiness and joy are choices choose joy happiness can come by choosing to be inspired and investing and using your time wisely have fun by doing your work put on more genuine smiles and avoid the fake or pasted on grin learn to love hateful things love your work practice study keep records of your business or notes on your learning persist remember some popular singers make it with a poor voice some celebrities make it without being the most beautiful the most talented or the most connected it s because they are persistent and they believe in what they re doing through and through ultimately the key to seizing luck is to finish what you start or to work it into a new way to try again,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to pray effectively,there is no one way to pray but learning the basics of prayer doesn t need to take a lifetime to master if you want to make prayer a part of your life you can learn to make room learn how to speak to the god in whom you believe and how to make prayer a part of your daily life,find a quiet space if you want to get started praying effectively all you need is some time and some peace and quiet whether you re at home or in public find a nice comfortable place to sit quietly for a few minutes and center yourself that s all you need 1 x research source can t find a time out from your hectic schedule you don t need a perfectly serene meditation room to pray effectively though it helps some of us to be centered and calm but you can pray anywhere anytime in any kind of environment a quick prayer in the middle of a hectic work shift make it happen a shout of praise after you score a touchdown good call driving down the highway during rush hour just as long as you drive safely pray in whatever way feels natural in some religions it s common to prostrate yourself and touch your head to the ground during prayer in others sitting in the lotus position is essential to meditation and prayer in others raising your hand and rejoicing loudly is sometimes common but there s no one way to pray except the way in which you feel the most comfortable communicating with your god if it helps to speak out loud go ahead and do it if you d rather keep your prayers to yourself that s perfectly fine too it helps some practitioners to bow their heads and close their eyes during prayer but it s also perfectly fine to leave your eyes open speak normally prayer doesn t need to involve a lot of thou thee or thines the all knowing all feeling being that you worship is smart enough to understand your language whatever that language is set aside some time each day prayer is a practice a way of life if you want to start praying effectively try to set some time aside each day to pray even a few minutes each day can make a difference some common times for prayer include 2 x research source before meals before sleep after waking during idle time during stressful moments talk to a religious advisor learning more about prayer from a respected elder or experienced member of your religion can be quite helpful in learning the style and the substance that goes into prayer pray together and learn more learn the traditional prayers used in your religion as well as ways to incorporate more informal prayers into your daily routine make time for prayer with others confess a common aspect of many prayer traditions involves confronting your personal transgressions guilt and sins to your higher power as a means of atonement 3 x research source in other words if you re feeling guilty about something prayer is an excellent opportunity to get it off your chest you don t need to make excuses for your actions or try to explain yourself just confront the things that you ve done that you re feeling guilty about what would you like to change about yourself what would you like to change about your life ask for forgiveness 4 x research source giving up some of yourself to a higher power can be a big challenge and an emotional experience for many people it can be humbling to ask for forgiveness or to admit that you need help but it s also one of the most important parts of prayer express your thanks and gratitude another important part of prayer for many believers is to give thanks think about the things you have and how fortunate you are to be alive in the world even if you re struggling or feeling down focusing on the things you re thankful for can be a good way of bringing yourself back up 5 x research source if it helps come up with a list and keep it by your bedside or on your table to reference when you pray list the things you re thankful for ask for protection and guidance many people pray to their god for protection guidance and wisdom many people need help if you feel that you re struggling in the world and want to lean on your god do it in prayer 6 x research source try to stay focused on your feelings and your emotions not on the specific details you re not praying to ask god to strike down your boss who works you too hard you re praying for protection for strength and for guidance your asking for help focus only on what is important prayer isn t a request line praying to ask for a bigger paycheck a new car or some rollerblades isn t the purpose of prayer and might even be considered insulting or blasphemous in some cultures the purpose of prayer is not to receive material goods the purpose of prayer is to develop a personal relationship with your god 7 x research source recite the traditional prayers in your religion many religions have a detailed series of specific prayers to use for specific occasions a catholic may recite the hail mary several times a day for example 8 x research source learn the traditions of your religion when you pray during formal worship services again there s no one way but it helps the flow of the service if you understand basically when it s time to participate in a call and response when it s time to kneel and other ritualized prayer activities develop the correct attitude generally prayer is a way of centering yourself and focusing your attention on communicating with the higher power you believe in some religions have very ritualized methods of prayer while others are more informal regardless of your religion however the most important aspect of prayer is developing the correct attitude 9 x research source be humbled again prayer isn t like writing to an advice column or making withdrawals from a bank remember who you re talking to and who you re opening yourself up to be respectful and speak with humility don t try to feel god doing anything while you pray and don t try to have an experience the loudest in the room is not the strongest and by no means is the quietest the most wise if you feel emotional that s fine but you don t need to be taken in by dramatic displays of devotion know how to listen seldom will the clouds part and a booming voice will drop a new ipad into your life that s not how prayer works try to stay aware of subtle changes in your life and opportunities that present themselves if you ask for guidance with a new job don t expect that a mysterious letter will show up under your door five minutes later with explicit instructions watch out for new acquaintances opportunities to shine in the way you shine best and stay strong have the faith that you ll see the right path in prayer 10 x research source even if you re a devout believer you re still the one with the free will to choose your own path you re the one who s in charge of your own life and it ll be your job to make the right decision if you asked for a job go look for one if you asked for your children to behave better teach them to do so prayer is an effective tool for many people but it s also not an excuse for avoiding making plans you still have to live your life not writing a will when you re sick because god will provide is being irresponsible not finding work to feed your family because you re praying for food is a misunderstanding of prayer pray with others praying together can be a powerful experience whether you go to church to pray or want to hold informal prayer groups in your own home or elsewhere getting together to worship your god is an essential part of the experience of belief you can accomplish a lot together 11 x research source it s also common to make prayer requests in some churches when some people are going through rough patches if a loved one is sick you might reach out to others to pray together find others through your church or in your area who pray regularly develop a habit of prayer make prayer a part of your life 12 x research source stay in touch with the higher power in whom you believe and return to prayer daily whenever and however you choose to pray if you want to pray effectively it needs to be a regular part of your life if you haven t prayed for a while don t be afraid to start again it s like riding a bike you may feel a little shaky at first but you ve still got it in there try again,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to take a leap of faith,an opportunity lies before you either in your personal or professional life but pursuing it appears undeniably risky from your current vantage point taking that leap of faith is a daunting move to make but depending on the circumstances it might be the best thing to do,figure out your motivation ask yourself if the leap of faith you re about to make is motivated by fear or love decisions motivated by love are usually easier to follow through on every leap of faith will bring a little fear with it but fear must not be the only thing pushing you forward 1 x research source ask yourself one simple question if no one else were around to watch you or remark on your decision would you choose to take this leap or not the option you would take with no audience is probably the decision you would make based on love look at the facts emotions fade with time but facts and reason remain consistent there will always be something risky about a leap of faith but there should also be some factual evidence to support the possibility of success jumping from a bridge or an airplane would be suicide but putting on a bungee cord or a parachute turns the experience into a risk you can probably walk away from if you ll definitely fall without divine intervention don t make the leap if you have enough support to at least break your fall however you can consider the leap acknowledge the little risks you take even the simplest of everyday tasks has a risk factor think about the daily risks you take that you have grown accustomed to the possibility of things going wrong might seem slim with these risks but recognizing the risk involved can help you see that you are already capable of confronting potential hazards for example even getting in your car and driving to work in the morning presents some sort of risk your car could break down another car might hit you or something gravely unpleasant could happen to you once you arrive at the office since these risks are all fairly unlikely you usually don t think about them and even if you do you don t let them stop you from going to work as usual each day respond to well meaning critics there will be many people who try to talk you out of your leap of faith and most of these people will be well meaning individuals who love you and are concerned for your well being learn to appreciate their concern without letting it stop you think back to a time when you took a big risk that paid off and recall the excitement and freedom you felt then think back to a time when you allowed the fears of others to hold you back instead of leaping recall the disappointment and bitterness you felt if the advice your loved one gives you evokes the feeling of liberation listen to it if the advice evokes a sense of disappointment ignore it act calm and try to reassure your loved ones that you have things under control even if you re only pretending at the moment if you seem calm about your decision most of your loved ones will probably feel a little less stressed about it too look down both roads consider what might happen if you take your leap of faith then think about what will likely happen if you don t compare the two possible futures and ask yourself which looks better to you try to imagine yourself in a year create three different pictures your life if you succeed your life if you fail and your life if you don t budge ask yourself which picture you could feel the most proud of and chase after it 2 x research source think well of yourself have a little trust in your ability to succeed if you leave the ground expecting to fall on your face you probably won t leap as high or as far as you actually could the decisions you make about your own life should be empowering even if you re scared witless when you make them don t allow yourself to feel unworthy of the dream you have or lesser for pursuing it act quickly don t put it off any longer if the opportunity and desire exists now commit to taking your leap of faith now delaying your decision until you no longer have the chance to make it is nothing more than an indirect way of choosing not to jump if you can t start today then set a date mark that date on your calendar and tell people about it so that you remain accountable treat your leap of faith as a reality starting today even if the first physical step comes later stop dwelling on the negative it really might be true that a thousand different things can go wrong but fixating on those things now won t do anyone any good while your life is in the middle of transition you need to plan for the worst but expect the best 3 x research source when you re standing at a high summit you might tell yourself don t look down to ease the fear of falling that same principle should be applied here looking down at everything that could go wrong will make the fall more frightening and less successful keep the past in the past now is not the time for regret if everything about your life was already perfect you never would ve been tempted to take this leap idealizing what was will only make it harder to look ahead and work toward the best possible outcome focus on the present and the immediate future always think about the next step and walk so quickly that you don t have time to glance over your shoulder at the ground you left behind find support connect with people who are willing to support you during your plummet this support might be material in nature but for the most part emotional support is what you really need to look for 4 x research source find others who are in a similar state of free fall they may have made a leap of faith similar to yours or they may be undergoing their own test of courage either way these individuals will probably be able to relate to the fear and excitement you re experiencing accept the transformation the free fall period that follows your initial leap will change you but even the most painful changes are good as long as they allow you to grow if you resist the change however you will only rob yourself of the opportunity to mature leaps of faith are frightening and difficult moves to make but difficulties have a tendency to strengthen those who work their way through them once you realize that the experience has its own benefits regardless of the outcome you can begin to learn from it redefine success contemporary society tends to define success in terms of how much fame or fortune you have but those measurements of success are not absolute even if your leap of faith doesn t allow you to live comfortably it may still be a success in other ways focus on the positives in your life that disregard conventional ideas of success you may feel very satisfied with your family life or social life even if nothing is quite the way you want it to be you may still find fulfillment simply by pursuing your passions as long as you feel spiritually nourished your life is in a state of success stop looking around don t compare your life to the lives of those you know everyone has different circumstances so there s no real way to compare two different people in equal terms one person s idea of happiness may not match your own and even if it does the timeline they follow to reach that point won t be the same as yours simply because you re starting from two different positions and taking different steps to get there fail it isn t enough to simply accept failure as an option until you actually experience failure you won t learn to confront it and you won t be able to harden yourself against it of course this doesn t mean that you need to intentionally mess up a big break or engage in pointlessly reckless behavior the idea here is simply to accept failure as a part of life instead of thinking that it s a necessary evil and trying to avoid it accept that it will come and greet it when it does press on regardless of whether you fail or succeed you need to maintain the momentum you ve built up and continue on with your life this might mean sticking with the path you put yourself on turning around or pursuing an entirely new venture if you fail focus on your next move instead of the failure itself ask yourself if you need to retrace your steps try harder along the same path or pursue a new path altogether if you succeed celebrate but don t linger and become complacent in your success figure out the next step you need to take on the path you re on to continue and deepen your current success leap often after taking one leap of faith take another then another and another after that as with anything practice will improve performance taking risks and leaping into the unknown becomes easier when you do it more often with experience you ll gradually gain the ability to deal with and resolve unexpected problems that appear each time experience will also grant you the ability to dust yourself off and walk away from each crash landing more effectively,Philosophy-and-Religion

old king of salem melchizedek he teaches the boy for the first time what a personal legend is he says that a personal legend is what you have always wanted to accomplish 21 acknowledge your personal legend the language of the world will attempt to reveal your personal legend to you in many different ways whether it be through omens mentors or signs whichever way you come to know your personal legend it is important that you acknowledge it and take action to make your dreams a reality after all when you really want something the universe always conspires in your favour 36 it is easiest for people to realize their legend when they are young because at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible they are not afraid to dream and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their life but as time passes a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their personal legend 21 this is why santiago is the ideal candidate because he has not become jaded over time that being said you are able to pursue your personal legend at any time in your life have a clear goal create for yourself a goal in which you will be able to realize when you have completed your legend without a clear explicit goal or personal legend it is impossible to ever achieve it the king said that you must always know what it is that you want 56 santiago s goal was to find the treasure awaiting him in egypt do not be a sheep coelho uses santiago s sheep to illustrate a life of someone who has ignored the call to their personal legend they live a mundane life where all they think about is food and water 11 while these are important things there is so much more to life than just the necessities money and greed corrupt some people so that all they think about is how to get more which is similar to how the sheep are focused only on one thing at a time the sheep don t even realize that they re walking a new road every day 11 very similar to the way some people get so caught up in the day to day that they forget to stop and smell the roses appreciate the simple things the gypsy tells santiago that it s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary only wise men are able to understand them 15 when you feel like giving up don t sometime during your quest you will feel as if the universe is not conspiring to help you achieve your legend at this point the king will always appear in one form or another sometimes he appears in the form of a solution or a good idea at other times at a crucial moment he makes it easier for things to happen 23 he goes on to say that often times he does other little things but people rarely notice them santiago experiences this when he first arrives in tangiers and is robbed he thinks to himself that he s too insignificant to conquer the world 39 and is really down on himself but that is when he remembers the stones the king gave him this omen tells him to continue on his journey remember the old proverb it is said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn let go of your fears and doubts santiago realizes after hearing about the baker s ignorance to his personal legend that there is nothing to hold him back except himself 28 the main reason why the average person including the baker and the crystal merchant will fail to seek out their personal legend is safety people are more concerned with making a name for themselves and being comfortable that they choose to settle for an average life when santiago meets the camel driver he reveals to santiago that people are always afraid of losing what they have whether it s their life or possessions and property but this fear evaporates when they understand that their life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand 76 by trusting in fate you are able to free yourself from these fears the alchemist teaches santiago this as well when he says don t give into your fears if you do you won t be able to follow your heart there is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve the fear of failure 141 without fearing failure you are free to pursue any path you like follow the omens the importance of this step cannot be stressed enough omens help guide santiago in his quest and the king reiterates this lesson over again before he leaves so that santiago will not forget it saying don t forget the language of omens 30 the crystal merchant asks santiago at one point why ask more out of life and santiago replies because we have to respond to omens 52 it s clear that the merchant has not responded to the omens and that is why he has a hard time understanding santiago s constant quest for greatness change your outlook and learn from every obstacle like the old saying you cannot change the direction of the wind you can only adjust your sails santiago realizes that when he thinks positively about his situation he is much closer to his legend after receiving the omen from the king in tangiers he thought to himself that this wasn t a strange place it was a new one 41 also when facing the vast desert santiago has to cross to reach egypt he recalls he s learned things from the sheep and he s learned things from crystal he can learn something from the desert too 73 even though santiago is not thrilled with the long walk ahead of him he knows that if he looks positively towards his obstacle he ll be able to learn valuable lessons from it carpe diem i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought but maybe i ll never have another chance to get to the pyramids in egypt the hills of andalusia were only two hours away but there was an entire desert between him and the pyramids yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation he was actually two hours closer to his treasure 64 santiago knows that his old life is always waiting for him but if he doesn t pursue his personal legend now he may never be able to do it again the camel driver also says to him if you can concentrate always on the present you ll be a happy man 85 since this is such an important message it comes up again when the topic of the seer comes up the seer says the secret is here in the present if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it and if you improve on the present what comes later will also be better each day in itself brings with it an eternity 103 seize the day and don t be distracted by the past or future go with your gut santiago begins to understand that intuition is really a sudden immersion of the soul into the universal current of life where we are able to know everything 74 our heart knows how to interpret the omens and therefore knows the right decision when our conscious mind is not able to decide on its own santiago later realizes that he and his heart had become friends and neither now was capable of betraying each other 134 when you really get to know your heart you are able to listen to the soul of the world the alchemist tells santiago you already know what you need to know i am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure 115 this quote illustrates how the power to find your personal legend within you otherwise it wouldn t be your legend your mentors will only give you the nudge in the right direction that you may need from time to time trust that you and your heart can always make the right decision realize when you ve arrived at your personal legend since you have defined a goal early on you should be able to realize when you have completed your personal legend after this you may find that you discover another and another yet whatever you do whether you are content where you are or you strive for more do not forget the lessons you have learned in your journey after all it is not necessarily they goal you must pursue instead savour the time it takes you to get there,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to argue against christianity,debating a subject as delicate as religion requires forethought clear headedness and immense tact to argue against christianity use the following guidelines,pick your battles striking up a debate with someone who welcomes discussion chooses to proselytize or is belligerent towards non christians is very different from picking a fight with someone whose values you don t happen to agree with christians who are going about their business don t want to be attacked for their beliefs any more than you do identify what you d like to argue against specifically do you have a problem with an ethical standpoint presented in the bible such as opposition to homosexuality if so you might point out other edicts in the bible that modern christians don t adhere to and ask what makes them fit to pick and choose do you think your own faith is more valid than christianity if so have points of comparison and contrast ready and be familiar with the texts of both religions do you dislike the idea of institutionalized religion in general if so focus on the atrocities committed by various religious institutions not just christianity throughout history do your homework though it s possible to come at the other debater entirely from your own perspective it will be much easier to poke holes their argument if you re willing to venture onto their turf research a few relevant historical points biblical quotes and their context and differences in biblical translation interpretation to both strengthen your own argument and anticipate various responses any time you think you have a good point look it up online to see what has already been said about it and modify scrap the idea as necessary address faith and institution separately whether or not you agree with this backing away from the idea that all faith is inherently flawed might be necessary to gain traction in your argument after all people have been arguing over the unknowable for as long as they ve been capable of arguing to make your target more realistic and keep the attack from getting personal consider focusing the debate on the church itself point out wars waged in the name of christianity such as the crusades and the bosnian war the fact that the old testament was used to justify slavery in america the fact that the church has a long history of covering up sex abuse against children and so on ask the other debater how s he can feel justified in supporting an institution with questionable morals especially if that support is financial address the difference between religion and morality some christians argue that their faith is useful for instilling morals if this is the case with your debater let them know about your own philosophy and civic volunteering to demonstrate that it s possible to be a good person without being a christian point out some of the many instances of abuse within the church and ask why christian values didn t prevent these acts if your debater responds that members of the church are free to choose whether or not to be moral point out that non believers are free to do the same making christian values no more or less useful than any others seek out flawed logic if your debater is a literalist have a few biblical self contradictions ready and ask which one the bible would have you believe while you re at it point out variations in the translations and editing over time or better yet ask if the debater has read the text in its original language this is also useful if the debater invests his her argument very heavily in the wording of a particularly passage if your debater believes that accepting jesus erases sins and is the only way to reach salvation ask what s he thinks happened to jewish victims of the holocaust in the afterlife be very careful about how you do this remember this is an exercise in pointing out inconsistencies in logic not trying to associate an innocent debater with a heinous war criminal anticipate counter arguments if for example you propose that science is more trustworthy than religion expect to hear the argument that science is constantly being reinterpreted in many ways more so than christianity what people accept as fact today would have been laughed at 100 years ago which can be said about a huge number of points in history making it reasonable to assume that much of what we take for granted right now will become defunct in the future additionally be prepared to debate whether or not the amount of scientific advances ex global warming mass warfare nuclear weaponry and so on is helpful or harmful to society don t expect to create a convert let go of the need to emerge from the debate victorious you are about as likely to win over a firm believer as s he is to bring you into the fold instead aim to have a diplomatic well reasoned exchange that does you justice and gives you both something to think about,Philosophy-and-Religion

religion general religion lack of personal thought when you subscribe to a religion you substitute group think for focused independent thought instead of learning to discern truth on your own and formulate your own beliefs you re told what to believe fixed perspective by saying i am a catholic or i am a buddhist you rob yourself of spiritual depth perception and attach blinders that do not allow you to see all realities lack of power religions are authoritarian hierarchies where power is heaviest at the top and lightest at the bottom where the majority of believers are religions are very good at turning human beings into sheep they operate by eroding your trust in your own intellect and gradually convince you to put your trust into some external entity such as a deity or great book convincing you that without these you would be lost wasted time religions often dictate that you have to pray attend church and read religious texts regularly some people take this even further with memorization of religious texts or other time consuming activities forgo intelligence or become a hypocrite when you subscribe to an organized religion you have only two options you can forgo intelligence or you can become a hypocrite you either willingly believe everything decreed to you by the religion for example believing that the earth is only 6 000 years old or you can recognize that many parts of religion are nonsense but believe it to be infallible all the same where you re born has a lot to do with your religion born in north america chances are you follow a judo christian religion born in india maybe you re a hindu born in tibet could be a buddhist if you were born somewhere else to some different set of circumstances do you think you still would have found your way to your religion or are your current beliefs really just a by product of your environment and not a conscious choice you made religion rules with fear fear of hell fear of excommunication fear of disappointing one s parents fear of abandoning the community fear of being different when you practice organized religion instead of conscious decision making you live under a constant fear eventually

telling everyone that will listen that islam has given more rights to women than any other religion certainly if by islam they mean qur anic islam the rights that it has given to women are impressive however islamic law is not derived solely from the quran and many of muhammad s extra quranic sayings the hadith appear to curtail women s human rights severely for example muslims who practice female genital mutilation cite authentic ahadith to support the practice muhammad encouraged it as he believed it was more pleasurable for the husband furthermore a review of muslim history will bring to light many areas in which qur anic teaching aside women continue to be subjected to diverse forms of oppression muslim societies in general appear to be far more concerned with trying to control women

how to determine moral principles without religion,ethics is the branch of philosophy which encompasses the analysis and proposition of moral principles and the conduct of a just life many theists argue that a higher power is the only possible source for moral principles modern ethicists categorically deny that this is the case if the ideas proposed by a religious text are good they are good independent of the speaker determining moral principles without religion doesn t mean you can t be spiritual it simply means thinking through morals on your own instead of accepting them as fact,consider the most certain principles of your life the principles that you never violate what are these principles and why are they important for most people aggressive violence falls into this category as does stealing and lying but this self examination of morals is perhaps the most important step to determine moral principles without religion it is okay even expected not to have full answers for every question but you should ask them image determine moral principles without religion step 4 version 2 jpg center is it ever right to commit a crime is it right to follow all laws or only those you agree with is total honesty a good thing or is it unattainable what is your line between helping your group or community and looking out for yourself who or what are you loyal to do you ascribe to similar moral principles understand that this life is the only one we have morality should not say how we live in this life in order to obtain a better position in the possible afterlife instead morality should maximize utility in this life because there are very real issues and ideas on earth that need your thoughtful care one can concoct a moral code with many different goals and aims but it remains that this life is the only one we have this principle should never be far from your mind your actions have consequences in the real world for your life and the lives of others don t ignore these effects in an effort to plan for the afterlife make the most of your present situation consider the real world causes and inspirations of amoral behavior religions generally believe that evil or bad actions are the failure of the individual it is someone s fault as they strayed from the moral tenants of religion out of selfishness anger or some internal evil or flaw but most evil acts are the result not of consciously evil people but rather the circumstances surrounding them for example rape and male violence can in some circumstances propagate the human race as evil men like genghis khan created hundreds of offspring in their evolutionary and sub conscience desire to spread his dna these violent tendencies still run in modern day humans as it was a highly successful genetic mutation to rape and pillage in ancient times frequently evil is done in an effort to survive even if that effort is fundamentally misguided while hitler s actions are unquestionably immoral what about the rest of the germans that went along with it the entire country was in horrible poverty and depression and a charismatic leader convinced them he could return them to safety and wealth the choice wasn t considered moral it was practical 1 x research source continue reevaluating and adjusting your morals to be both up to date and consistent this is a continuing task and one s moral principles must be updated as society progresses and new ideas and situations are discovered one of the big mistakes in religious morality is that people assume that everything has been right for 2 000 or more years and that no changes need to be made to fit modern times but this often betrays the underlying moral tenants of treating others fairly and avoiding violence as modern day sects of islam can attest keep your mind more open than this and secular moral principles will soon become much clearer everyone should spend time re thinking their moral code to fit new problems and issues look no further than pope francis who quickly set about reexamining and modifying centuries old catholic dogma about homosexuality women the environment and capitalism 2 x research source illustrate your moral code in actions not just in thoughts think about your morals and follow them whatever they may be it doesn t make sense to have a set of moral principles which one does not abide by remember that other people have different ideas of morals and accept that you can do no more than to follow your own code ultimately your morality is going to be determined by your actions and words not by your thoughts consider modern ethical quandaries and dilemmas to deepen your moral principles physicians know that there is little that they can do to prevent the subject s death due to terminal life ending illnesses in such instances is it okay to help a patient kill themselves peacefully or should they be kept alive as long as possible meat production and consumption causes suffering to animals and the environment is it morally wrong to eat animals when you know that vegetarianism may be better for the planet if you do is it ethical to let your pets eat meat or is it immoral to force carnivores to skip meat if there is a war in a foreign country and civilians are being murdered is it more moral to risk us troops to save them or to let each nation decide its own fate without intervention from outsiders there are no right answers here only difficult questions that need to be asked having an answer to a moral quandary like those above requires thought and detail to truly determine moral principles you ll need to do some research keeping your arguments based on facts and reason often helps avoid the traps imposed by religious moral thinking 3 x research source consider the socratic philosophy of self knowledge where intelligence itself creates morals socrates and many of his fellow greeks believed that ignorance or lack of information creates evil and bad behavior 4 x research source william s sahakian mabel lewis sahakian 1966 ideas of the great philosophers barnes amp noble isbn 978 1 56619 271 2 they argue that most people want to do the right thing but never fully think out the repercussions of their actions most people do the right thing because it makes them happy but you only know the right thing through honest review of the facts what are the long term consequences of my choice who else will my choice affect will it positively or negatively affect my relationships what is being lost in this decision what is being gained 5 x research source william s sahakian mabel lewis sahakian 1966 ideas of the great philosophers barnes amp noble isbn 978 1 56619 271 2 think through the biological motivations for generosity and altruism throughout most of human evolution people lived in small bands where the members were closely related and likely to remain in contact with each other throughout their lives being altruistic to other members of the band strengthened the community allowing its members to produce more successful offspring the closeness of the community also put other members in a position to reciprocate which directly aids and reinforces the moral codes colloquially one might call this a win win situation where helping others instead of competing with them allows everyone to be better off from meerkats to schools of fish and of course humans morality doesn t come from a god it comes from the evolutionary benefits of supporting each other treating people with decency honesty and kindness is almost always repaid by favors from others and a safe productive community to live in consider consequentialism or the moral idea that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences it is in stark contrast to the deontological codes of conduct laid out by most religions in that the same action can have different moral worth under different circumstances developed over many centuries there are a lot of consequentialist ethical frameworks out there such as utilitarianism and rule consequentialism to live as a consequentialist is to ensure in the words of utilitarian philosopher jeremy bentham the greatest happiness of the greatest number 6 x research source what counts as a good consequence make sure you consider how your decisions will affect others as your relationships ultimately affect you as well the outwardly right act according to religion is somewhat irrelevant for example stealing is wrong in most religions but is stealing from the rich to feed your starving children really immoral if you consider the actual consequences examine the overlap of ideas between cultures to find common moral ground independent cultural overlap generally suggests that a moral principle is valid for example the golden rule do unto others as you would have them do unto you is not uniquely christian and is indeed echoed throughout ethical philosophy across the globe people everywhere agree that you should treat others with respect indicating that this is a solidly human moral principle the ideas outlined in the united nation s universal declaration of human rights are generally considered a worldwide though incomplete framework for basic decency and morality dive deeper into the moral writings of philosophers and religious thinkers while the reader may consider many parts of religious and philosophical texts amoral and lack a belief in any deity that does not discount the positive ideas of those writers the writers of such texts were definitely human and their ideas can be valid outside of the context of religion some famous ethical and moral tracts to start with include beyond good and evil friedrich nietzche the moral landscape sam harris ethics benedict de spinoza the writings of st augustine christian theologist nicomachean ethics aristotle groundwork for the metaphysics of morals immanuel kant a vindication of the rights of women mary wollstonecraft 7 x research source understand that the human intellect is the greatest tool that we yet know and that your rationale is important understand that the presence or absence of a higher power has no effect on your moral code unless he or she were to provide a code that is superior to one that you can deduce on your own in this case a moral and logical atheist would accept such a code without question however despite its godly origin such an atheist would still recognize the value in questioning this divine moral code in order to potentially obtain even greater moral right if such as divine code is perfect then questioning it only serves to support its greatness and make it stronger as such one should never fear questioning a moral code note that morality does not come from religion but from communities who interpret religion if a modern human were to stone to death an adolescent for not honoring his her father and mother we would certainly think him her immoral yet these are the prescribed punishments for such acts according to abrahamic texts found in the old testament since modern humans do not follow their religious texts to the letter they must have some method for determining which prescriptions to follow and which to discard which is ultimately where our morals come from ask yourself is this action good because god tells us to do it or is it simply a good thing to do if the action is only good because god says so then morality is nothing more than a checklist and there are likely few christians who believe that murder is moral just because someone talked back to their father remember that true moral goodness occurs because you want to help not because you have to when something is a requirement it s not actually moral anymore morality is about choice deciding to the right thing amongst many options but if you re only doing the right thing because a religious leader or text told you to or because you re scared of the consequences of hell you re not actually being moral you re being a sheep never forget that the mass murders of the spanish inquisition and crusades were considered moral because they were apparently backed up by the bible but anyone stepping back to think for themselves would have realized very quickly that senseless violence is never a good moral principle consider many of the clearly immoral positions of religions throughout history of course many of the adherents of these religions would argue that they are the most moral of all but something is a bit off when multiple religions with conflicting ideas all claim moral superiority recognize that if morality was completely divorced from religion a lot of the following events would likely not take place christianity sanctioned slavery and treatment of blacks as sub human in america radical islamic terrorist attacks civilian beheading and suppression of women s rights burmese buddhists using human sacrifice to gain political power and control 8 x research source understand that highly religious communities often have higher rates of violence and crime the myth that god is the glue that holds society together is a complete myth in fact most countries and states with high religious belief and participation are actually the most dangerous areas to live in meanwhile highly secular areas are strongly correlated with lower homicide rape and poverty levels of course this is a statistical trend and there are exceptions however even us states match these trends with secular states being safer than most highly religious ones 9 x research source note that atheists tend to be less prejudiced hateful and against limited rights for minorities time and time again it has been shown that atheists tend to be more tolerant than their strongly religious brethren the reasons are multifold lack of religion erases antiquated rules and morals and there is no inter religious hatred and rivalry that can spur so many atrocities like the crusades either way people who create their own moral codes instead of waiting for someone to give them one tend to treat others much more kindly 10 x research source remember to still accept the good of religious thinking and morality for all of its faults organized religion is a major part of human society and theologians of all faiths have pushed ethical and moral philosophy incredibly far even if there are some mistakes the biggest mistake is usually buying into religious morality wholesale without considering the faults thinking for yourself considering each principle on its own and not part of an antiquated belief system can help you stay spiritual and religious without feeling like your moral code is already prescribed morality will often be a mixture of ideas from many different cultures and religions and closing your mind entirely to theological thought is just as limiting as only considering one religion 11 x research source,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to be an idealist,anyone could have some strongly held ideals without being an idealist all the time ideals are not just rules to be broken the idealist almost all of the time has strong beliefs or character even if not expressed and probably lives by holding definite ways perhaps some like absolutes laws one could be willing to fight and die for important ideals such a person would neither like to nor often easily compromise strong political or religious beliefs morals laws etc if most beliefs are not definite and persistent then the person is not an idealist as meant here agreeing with the idealistic person s ideals could bring calm and happy agreement but opposite answers may bring some level of diplomatic persuasion discussion or even real disagreement whether that disagreement is expressed or not compare to the opportunist who may say or do anything for personal gain i e like winning at all costs to seek a perceived advantage with the outcome justifies the means that is not even close to ideal the habitual optimist is hopeful and usually looking on the bright side but idealism is not necessarily positive at all sometimes the idealist may see no hope in accepting the other side s demands or purposes and then that idealism may become fatalistic like fighting or going to war but consistent to certain strongly held ideals here are some ways to be an idealist,believe in some form of definite way of doing or understanding things determine your personal standards of accuracy and consider whether they are rather absolute this can help assemble your strong concepts and idealized feelings as clearly as possible be dependable in your efforts to reach your goals on your principles avoid depending upon doing or accepting favors like buying a resistant opponents help in the long run you can not depend on such persons try not to compromise your ideals with opponents who will not accept your strong belief do not trade your real beliefs lightly do not give up your ideals idealism to get concessions do not accept views that you find to be wrong and therefore probably unacceptable and so do not give something important to get things that are less important in politics for example to get or to attempt to get what you want by any means possible is not acceptable as that implies lack of honest principles do not accept the middle of the road compromise which is an incorrect way but instead maintain your definite principles and morals without hypocrisy be well mannered patient and sensitive to other people s feelings and opinions beliefs saying you have a right to your own opinion will often lower the harshness of the argument of the two sides avoid wasting time arguing with people of strong opposite views defend your beliefs especially if they are absolutes i e possibly this involves religious absolutes or political principles the other side may try to wear you down such as trying to get you to give up and quit trying be very persistent in presenting your facts without becoming angry and upset be fair and balanced by treating everybody the same and as much as possible accept individual differences of opinion and belief realize that you may be enough of an idealist to see the opposite view as not worth much consideration and though that seems harsh you as an idealist will probably be quite persistent not wishy washy be kind and loving when you must disagree though you may feel that agreeing is not at all practical in your understanding of the facts refine your efforts and come back to try again on another day if necessary,Philosophy-and-Religion

god has created many good things in the world appreciate nature and the people around you think critically about criticisms of religion some people may try to sway you or convince you to give up your faith you may choose to hear what they say or just ignore them remember that everyone has their own agenda so keep that in mind as you hear different things religion is a human institution god is divine but humans are flawed you can accept that some christians have strayed while still being a christian and continuing your belief in god accept that your belief goes beyond science and logic the world does have a place for science and logic and they can be used to improve lives in areas like science technology and public policy however religious beliefs go beyond this there is nothing wrong with choosing to believe in god despite a lack of conclusive evidence that s why they call it faith if someone tries to question the logic of your christian beliefs try saying i understand that it may not seem logical but faith comes from the heart not the mind i choose to have faith in god and this makes me happy i hope you can accept that recognize that appreciating science does not have to mean denying god god has created a beautiful and complicated world and humans still do not understand all of it understanding the world s beauty can bring you closer to god find communities that center on god try church clubs sunday schools bible study groups or volunteer organizations that involve conversations about god you may choose to talk to a religious mentor especially if you re struggling with your relationship with god find someone who encourages you to ask questions and talk things through think critically about religious extremists not everyone who claims they are doing god s work is actually doing god s work beware people who advocate being cruel discriminatory or violent towards other people harming other people is a sin judge not and be kind to your neighbor even though they are a sinner we are all sinners and it is up to god to judge us god helps those who help themselves if someone advocates endangering yourself or denying medical care to you or your children don t listen to them if your daughter has cancer then chemotherapy might be part of god s plan for her be skeptical of hypocrites some people talk about doing good work but turn around and do great harm in this case it is their behavior that is confusing not god here are some examples of hypocrites you may encounter a politician who volunteers at a soup kitchen then passes legislation that hurts the poor someone who claims to help people with disabilities yet refuses to allow disabled people to speak for themselves a person who claims to support religious freedom but bullies people from different religions someone who claims to love their neighbor yet engages in name calling or other hurtful behavior respect others beliefs without letting them confuse you different religions have different ideas of god you can acknowledge different beliefs without needing to believe in them yourself dismiss people who do not treat you well while some atheists are peaceful and polite others may get in your face or speak cruelly about religion try not to worry too much about people who engage in bad behavior after they die they can sort this out with god show forgiveness to people who are confused misguided or hurting inside be patient with your personal journey many christians have a complicated relationship with faith and it is normal to be confused at times god is far too deep and complex for any human mind to comprehend accept that you are on a journey in your faith and take time to appreciate it,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to make a case for deism,if you are tired of superstitions and the dogma of hearsay ancient texts but clearly see that blind chance cannot sufficiently explain the richness of your everyday experience then deism may be the religion of choice for you this article will equip you to make a case for deism to both theists and atheists based on rational arguments and the personal observation and personal experience of nature,challenge the christian concept of sacrifice the bible says without the shedding of blood there can be no remission of sins to require the death of animals and people to remedy disobedience to god seems sick and twisted how can we be sure of what god s laws really are how can we be sure that disobedience to god s laws separates us from god how can we be sure that the shedding of blood will reunite us with god what are the characteristics of union with god why would a god of love require destructive and wasteful death to restore a broken relationship with mankind challenge the popular doctrine that human nature is sinful and that the world is fallen in the biological arena the vast majority of organisms naturally operate based on self preservation mechanisms but human beings have the option of choosing to deviate from this norm self love is ineffably beautiful and whilst many religions promote ethical philosophies of concern for others this latter noble aspiration does not warrant tarnishing the elementary virtue of concern for one s own well being to survive any mistake is to have the opportunity to learn from it and organisms tend to grow stronger over time because of the challenges of life the possibility of the absence of any benefit makes its presence more valuable and love is most notably measured in time allocated to beneficial suffering pride can help to prevent a fall and shame can help to motivate a person to climb higher it may be argued that the ubiquitous characteristic of balance makes existence richer and the beauty of the night sky is evidence that light and darkness can sublimely coexist challenge the notion of an intervening deity why do people think that god answers prayers if so many prayers are seemingly unanswered and for the ones that are seemingly answered there may be a natural explanation for the results obtained there is a practical down to earth method of attaining almost everything that can be conceivably requested from a potentially intervening god with enough time and effort it is possible to conclude from personal observation and personal experience that maybe the various aspects of the universe which have opportunely fallen into place have done so because of a divine plan as opposed to blind chance but this does not automatically suggest the existence of a prayer answering divine being although it does suggest the possible existence of a deity and that a noble lifestyle is inherently possible for the majority of humanity based on the intelligent configuration of the universe challenge the notion of an omniscient deity that also confers free will to humanity most religions believe that their deity has given them free will to choose paths and actions but also ascribe omniscient knowledge to the same deity if a deity knows everything that implies they already know what will happen in the future regardless of how you choose to act the deity will already know what your every single thought will be throughout your entire lifetime those two concepts are mutually exclusive if they deity knows everything you will think and do there is no free will if it doesn t then it is not omniscient and is not a god if there is no free will then this means that determinism is true and that all credit and blame for all aspects of existence should be ascribed to the laws of nature or their potential divine author some people are of the view that even if there is no free will that a determined response trumps a random response because there are standards challenge the idea that miracles occur why do people believe that the humanly impossible takes place why aren t there ever clear before and after depictions to verify the occurrence of such alleged miracles such as a perception of a person before and after the spontaneous regeneration of a limb in the absence of such the evidence for miracles is weak at best challenge the belief in life after death our awareness vacillates between the realm of the brain and the realm of the body but what evidence is there for any other realm of existence when a person dies the voice is silenced and the body is stilled and what about this suggests that something continues to exist subsequent to expiration as opposed to the awareness being extinguished in a manner akin to the outage of the flame of a candle out of body experiences may require an active brain to occur if they do in fact occur as opposed to being very vivid dreams so this is inconclusive challenge the supposed divinity of the bible or any other ancient text what about the bible suggests that god may have personally influenced the contents of such it contains potentially accurate and inaccurate accounts of history poetry advice vague and questionable so called prophecies all from the judeo christian culture but nothing resembling a divine signature do people simply believe that the bible contains information intended by god to be in it simply because it says so and why should it be believed any text with some amount of useful information is worth keeping around for generations so its longevity should not be construed as proof of its divinity understand the controversy surrounding the idea of a first cause there exists mystery but there also exists a rich nature from which to extrapolate whether a person believes that god or the universe is the first cause it can be reasonably advanced that life emerged from a source of dignity rationality and creativity sophistication of form and function is usually the result of conscious intention as opposed to blind accidents however the catch 22 is that the original intender is presumed to be sophisticated in form and function hence the cause and effect are mutually dependent with unexplained sophistication if the universe is eternal then this obviates the possibility of a divine creator faith in a divine source is still not rendered so fragile though because important questions are unanswered differentiate deism from atheism the only recourse for an atheist is to assert that we are lucky to be alive whereas a deist is at liberty to credit a god with the existence of life and the universe although some people may hold the view that a non intervening deity is a useless deity however it is a matter of connecting dots and the universe and life overwhelmingly appear to be the product of a rational mind and will whom deists identify as the divine creator who wound up everything and left it all to majestically unfold,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to have a belief in reincarnation,you may have heard about the idea of reincarnation that after we die we are all reborn perhaps you are studying hinduism or buddhism or for some other reason would like to believe in reincarnation but you re not entirely sure you do the buddha taught that you should never simply believe something because you ve been taught it but should check it against your own experience but how do you actually do that follow these steps to investigate reincarnation so you can apply your own judgement,read up on reincarnation to believe in something you must at least understand what it is go to the bookstore library or search topics on the internet look for hindu buddhist new age and wiccan approaches to reincarnation search for examples that some people believe show proof of incarnation there are well known cases where children have gone to strange towns and known residents there and even insisted that a certain home was theirs do these stories ring true for you or do you think adults prompted them sometimes reading something is proof enough but for true skeptics you must find more solid proof look for reincarnation proof in everything and everyone around you what mechanism creates a child prodigy like mozart could child prodigies simply have learnt their skills in previous lives and now remember them do you have friends with incredible skills that came really easily to them ask other people what they think about the idea of reincarnation if they believe in it do they have any examples they believe prove it think think undisturbed thoughts about life death in between and reincarnation consider whether it makes more sense to you that your mind simply stops existing after death and if it doesn t what do you think could happen to it besides reincarnation be persistent accepting new ideas takes time as does finding proof that something is incorrect take time to ensure your research totally convinces you,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to have christian faith without being presumptuous,faith can be believing that god can make a difference in your life but to be presumptuous can mean being arrogant or disrespectful just as jesus prayed your will be done not my will so should we pray,realize that god is god and you are not in charge of the universe god is you know jesus said we all have power to be witnesses and the holy spirit will also revive you but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwells in you romans 8 11 you cannot declare things into existence like god can you can ask whatever things you desire in jesus name and do not doubt then god will always answer your prayers yes no or wait do not be judgmental of others try not to think negative thoughts about them understand that the job of judgment belongs to god and him alone while you may think that he must be angry at someone for whatever reason abortion atheism being gay etc understand that that is between him and them your job is to love others remember that prayer is about making requests not telling god what to do don t be presumptuous and think that god will give you whatever you want in praying and asking god for things don t assume that he will absolutely do whatever you are asking for the bible says that god will meet all of our needs not all of our wants there were dozens of people that jesus did not heal when the pharisees asked jesus for a sign he usually did not give them one remember to stay humble when you pray a great verse is what is man that you are mindful of him also james 4 14 says what is your life you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes amen we are nothing but dust essentially we are like ants compared to the magnificence of god the creator of the world to think of ourselves as on the same level as god or even close would be very prideful his ways are as far above ours as the heavens are above the earth know that sometimes god does not want to give us what we want a big reason for this is because god might realize that the thing we want might become an idol for us god doesn t want us to be distracted from focusing on him so there are certain things he might never give us testing oneself is fine but testing god is doubt and distrust see the truth that god does not necessarily want you to be rich there is a popular idea out now that god wants you to be wealthy but that concept cannot be found in the bible but he shall give you all things according to his riches in glory but not if we ask amiss to consume it to ourselves share give loan what you can and agree on terms but do not demand or insist that the debtor makes the repayment the debtor knows to repay you so if he does not then he is doing that to god yet jesus taught that we should be willing to give all that we have away to the poor jesus said that you cannot love both god and money money often conflicts with our devotion to god therefore often times god will not give us a lot more money than we need realize that god is capable of healing anything or anyone he wants but he is not always willing to for whatever reason god allows many people to live with pain in the bible paul says that god allowed satan to give him a thorn in his flesh to humble him sometimes god will let us suffer physically to humble us and draw us close to him suffering often produces a greater character in someone therefore god allows us to suffer to make us better people remember that god works all things together for good just because you might want some discomfort to go away now that does not mean that it is in your best interest that it does god might use a test you are going through now to become your testimony later on and bring others to christ god sees the big picture whereas we only see what is happening now trust that god knows what he is doing,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to discuss religion calmly,debating religion with someone of faith can be very frustrating indeed especially if approached in the wrong way this article will hope to provide you with some helpful instructions for going about it so as to make the experience as enjoyable and satisfying as any discussion about such an important topic should be,be prepared this is the most crucial prerequisite for discussion on any topic reading is the most important thing in preparation thanks to the recent wave of writing there is more than enough material to have a good understanding of arguments and counter arguments the first rule of engagement is know thy enemy so have also a decent knowledge of religious text doctrine and dogma meet the person target whether this discussion is planned as in with a close friend or relative or with someone you meet randomly on the train patience is essential after having put so much time and effort into the preparation you will no doubt be to say the least anxious to vent let the topic present itself and you will feel far more relaxed your goal should not be to de convert at least in the first conversation it should be to get the person to think critically about their beliefs and other aspects of life in general analyse the person and situation this will give you an idea of how best to approach the discussion though it is often pointed out that atheists have no one opinion fits all the same is true of the religious some having markedly differing opinions even in the same denomination so you must understand exactly what the person s opinions are instead of prejudging from what they have labeled themselves as this will also allow you to create some boundaries be calm unemotional and responsive this will be the biggest test of your ability it is most important in any discussion and is difficult to master you will improve it with experience any one discussion will not often begin in the same way as one had before therefore you must respond to the point in question directly and with that edge closer to a point you wish to make make a firm point ask a firm question try to make your audience really think vary the point and question depending on the particular discussion trying to fashion them to line up with whatever the person is putting forward the most as supportive to their viewpoint e g morality or design or consolation depending also on the length and scope of the conversation you may have to firmly argue or question more than once listen to their response a good thing to do is to repeat what they said before retorting so as to a show that you re listening and b make their point clear to yourself bring the conversation finally towards topics like but not limited to free speech free expression free inquiry other points here should stress evidence reason critical thinking etc trying to wrap up the discussion without directly talking about religion,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to accept intelligent design of the cornea,is it true that all cells are supplied with life giving oxygen from the blood system well no this will explain why not could it be that accident was involved and does it make sense to believe that mother nature which is imaginary like the spontaneous formation of the eye is imaginary like spontaneous beginning of life origins from chemicals without a plan and not from a mother cell or does it seem more logical that there were some intelligence a source of ability and power as planner guide and in ultimate control of the impossibly simultaneous innovations that were needed for even one living cell to exist or multicellular life to have organs like the eye the cornea and successful reproductive life itself logically would not exist without intelligent design id from the perspective of creationism,examine your knowledge to decide how to accept that there may be only one system in all the processes or your bodily systems that does not receive oxygen from the red blood what a coincidence or intelligent design the retina and all around the cornea has a rich blood supply look from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet so did or can you name even one system that is not supplied with blood to keep it sustained with life giving oxygen of course even the lungs have a necessary profusion of blood vessels seek a unique exception that exists of using blood to supply oxygen it may be a very special reason consider and analyze a unique unparalleled event in creation of the eye or body how or whether you can find that one exception it evidently is very special understood or find and read an explanation about respiration to support living tissues using red blood cells such that as you breathe the oxygen goes throughout all parts of the body even to the eye i e the retina has a very rich supply of capillaries to feed those cells to make sight possible see whether if makes sense to you how it is possible that no red blood cells go to only one living part of the body yes it does need oxygen that tissue is alive but does not get oxygen from the red blood and hemoglobin or from any other form of blood examine how cells and tissues of your body are otherwise served by hemoglobin a biomolecule that can temporarily bind to oxygen the blood s color is due to the red color of hemoglobin in the red blood cell wikipedia red_blood_cells think about being blind if red blood cells could and did spread into the corneal tissues you would not be able to see at all notice visible light wavelengths can not penetrate the relatively gigantic red blood cells that would interfere with the transmission of light to the retina in the back of the eye see what you think about this blood does not go to the cornea due to its function but mother nature originally would have no provision or plans about that it couldn t see any problem of course well the cornea can never have oxygen delivered by the bloodstream why must the cornea get its oxygen directly and not using the heart lungs and blood consider whether this was a coincidence or that it was an ingenious part of the plan to enable the cornea to get its oxygen supply directly from the air realize that the cornea has its own private breathing ability not using the lungs and blood vessels the cornea is composed of 5 cell layers epithelium bowman s layer stroma descemet s membrane and endothelium the cornea protects the rest of the eye from foreign material and germs but it also acts as the eye s outermost lens focusing the entry of light into the eye the shape of the cornea contributes part of the eye s total focusing power think about this if the cornea did not exist at all or did not have 100 functionality then the the rest of the lens area iris etc of the eye would lack protection from air and foreign matter and would also lose much of its focusing ability think about this the rest of the eye couldn t wait for the cornea to clear up it would have no reason to exist analyze why the worthless blood fed cornea could have waited for the eons billions of years that it would evidently have taken for the cornea to become clear transparent if it had blood supply as the eye and cornea never would have had any value at all otherwise because it would be un sighted if red blood had supplied the oxygen as with every other part of the vertebrate see if you agree that the cornea had to be created in very narrow manner to differ from the rest of vertebrates receiving blood throughout consider and explain this the body would only use unknowing unthinking unsighted evolution to figure out that blood could not be used to feed the eye its oxygen that mindless system would learn how to not send blood to the cornea what a stroke of genius by an uncoordinated unmanaged system called darwin s or evolutionary theory or not deduce whether it is by mere chance that the cornea is the only living tissue in the entire body to be totally separately supplied with oxygen not through the lungs,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to avoid being bitter christianity,to accomplish living a life without bitterness is to look at the life of jesus christ and what the bible says pertaining to forgiveness,do not seek revenge jesus gives us clear guidelines in forgiveness father forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors matthew 6 9 13 so we have to forgive others because we want our heavenly father to forgive us not one of us are perfect we cannot stay bitter do this otherwise god will not forgive us matthew 6 14 15 states if you forgive men when they sin against you your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive men their sins your father will not forgive your sins we have to do it if we want god to forgive us make a decision to forgive even if you have been hurt by words or actions of people yet you decide to immediately forgive the person no matter how you feel then you say aloud father i choose to forgive this person and the pain disappears take this big step toward obedience as soon as you have forgiven but still memories of the specific person or incident e g the pain of divorce or a horrifying rape comes back to mind then you declare aloud satan i have already forgiven this person and choose not to be bitter anymore forgiveness is a commandment mark 11 25 and when you stand praying if you hold anything against anyone forgive him so that your father in heaven may forgive you avoid a grudge like what that person has done to me is unforgivable but compare this to what people did to jesus the betrayal and the crucifixion our situation looks small in comparison to what jesus has experienced and yet jesus said father forgive them because they do not know what they are doing remember that jesus said matthew 5 43 48 you have heard that it was said you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy 44 but i say to you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you 45 so that you may be sons of your father who is in heaven for he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous 46 for if you love those who love you what reward do you have do not even the tax collectors do the same 47 if you greet only your brothers what more are you doing than others do not even the gentiles do the same 48 therefore you are to be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect but you know that god s love is perfect love but can we ever earn perfection no he perfected his gift of love grace in that while we were still sinners christ died and gave himself for us so that we may be perfect in his grace perfected by grace guard your heart be careful to whom and what you give your affections this is an important principle also to avoid getting entangled again overcome by those things again or else the end could be worse than the beginning,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to protect your opportunities for free enterprise entrepreneurship,if the government gives you your rights then what keeps them from taking them away just the same would you keep up pressure to avoid the dangerous concept of government giving you rights as a conservative regardless of any political party and you may help move your area state and nation to abundance mentality born of natural free rights and nature s god for individual free enterprise and to create jobs would you support taking the approach of the individual for freedom with limited government for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness,decide whether to take the personal stance that you have innate and inalienable inborn freedom liberty and rights by the nature of human existence with free moral agency with free choice for self determination for example to maintain the right to own property and form a proprietorship company or corporation as extensions of inborn equal free rights free rights are thought of as eternal and basic to existence not given by mankind under conservative government the people own their rights and loan rights to the government to use by our consent consider if you are a young person to organize a political table at school advocate for free rights i e liberty begin working for your cause and impact important events for your political hopes and your share of the american dream and develop prosperity consciousness consider seeking and voting for candidates as a conservative who promises to support and work to possibly cut taxes to spur cutting government spending revert unnecessary government spending slow or halt the possible intrusion of government in the lives of citizens economic and otherwise point out evidence of waste fraud and abuse remove unnecessary obstacles to entrepreneurship and opportunity urge and promote free enterprise free opportunity restore fairness to our judicial system by stemming the tide toward over criminalization of reasonable personal or corporate economic activity which is not proven to be fraudulent and reversing the policy of legislating from the bench restore the original election of the senate and the voting of the electorate consider promoting candidates who promise to restore conservative understandings of history of liberty as influenced and guided by men of faith and belief men who pray and serve god and mankind like ben franklin george washington john adams thomas jefferson abraham lincoln and many others help your candidates who support liberty and prosperity for your concept of individualism from a conservative personal perspective of god given liberty and rights invest in supporting your political representatives or becoming a representative of your brand of liberty such as your individual conservatism liberty and prosperity decide that you 1 feel that you are sick of spending as your possible future may be sinking drowning in debt of overspending on social agendas and 2 then to send an sos signal to your government that says i am sick of spending to try to help slow and stop professional politicians always seeking to be re elected from bankrupting your nation for example america and america s future and decide that you would help apply critical grassroots pressure to stop corrupt or free spending politicians from bankrupting your nation and decide whether you need to keep the pressure on your legislative representatives to end the tax and spend culture that is drowning your prosperity in your government s growing spending habit and massive debt called drowning in red ink examine that you can help expand your concepts into a broader initiative that includes your neighborhood local and state based grassroots individual relationships meetings and possibly training seminars aimed at promoting and increasing individual citizen participation in running for public offices to set policy through the legislative process and through the use of online initiatives such as blogging seek to make sure you are equipped with the materials ie concepts information to stand up for your individual rights your citizen participation in many areas of free enterprise including online decide that you would like to sway public opinion toward policy debates through the use of local and online materials and strategies including petitions and calling your government officials marching and political organizing consider becoming a voice as an influential grassroots media activist such as community organizing teaching and blogging for liberty and prosperity through greater use of free speech in person and on the internet see whether you may help provide impactful individual leadership individual grassroots information and possibly use organization and training with other like minded individuals to make your voices heard decide to join or form an organization with impact important events and voices decide how you may work with others to provide a solid program of online workshops and training seminars on media strategies such as how to integrate facebook into your social media strategy and tools that can help to mobilize and to advance free market policies let not your heart be troubled believe in divinely given rights and free opportunity and that governments are formed to serve you and the people under the creator s plan,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to imply intelligent design in the origin of the cornea creationism,can you individually logically believe and implicitly see intelligent design in the cornea in your thoughts read on is it true that all cells are supplied with life giving oxygen that is delivered by the heart lungs and blood vessel system no why does only one in all the many processes that comprise your bodily systems not receive oxygen from the red blood from the top of your head to the bottom of your feet did darwin know about that exception exclusive status of the cornea well that modern knowledge of that exception is true and can be analyzed explained or perhaps understood as some of your support for creationism and faith it is evident that the cornea may be seen as very special evidence of creation it is unique transparency unparalleled in animal life the cornea offers exclusive information to provoke your thought and possibly a gift of faith,study the cornea and lens system in the animal kingdom and see whether you individually find that as you breathe that exclusive way to getting oxygen would imply intelligent design as the oxygen goes throughout the body yet red blood cells do not and must not deliver oxygen to one particular area of body tissues via the blood the corneal lens system avoid believing that evolution could work through the problems that intelligent design can solve including the corneal transparency as you study darwinian theories of forming life inorganically without guidance at the origins plan or intelligent design search online what you yourself can learn and think about all other cells and tissues of your body being otherwise served by hemoglobin a biomolecule that can temporarily bind to oxygen the blood s color is due to the red color of hemoglobin in the red blood cell wikipedia red_blood_cells ask biologists whether you would need to get an artificial corneal implant if blood capillaries small blood vessels and red blood cells could and did flow through them and the corneal tissues which are made up of 5 layers similar to totally transparent skin which is unparalleled in the body how could had be by chance use formal logic a implies b of how obviously you would lose vision if the fluid in the hollow lens which is full of clear fluid became infused with capillaries but that is a different issue you would not be able to see ask eye doctors biologists and bio chemist whether the visible light wavelengths can or can not penetrate the relatively gigantic red blood cells how did light ever penetrate past capillaries that would intervene within the path of the transmission of light to the retina in the back of the eye why or how would there even be a retina as blood would have been or if it ever was the source of oxygen for the cornea if it evolved for billions or millions of years ask yourself and others what you they think about this why does blood not go to the cornea is it due to its function and is it a design feature that is not the expected way to get oxygen why can the cornea never have oxygen delivered by the bloodstream to the cornea research personally and you will find that the cornea does and must get its oxygen directly and not using the heart lungs and blood that is exclusive and unfathomable necessity that blind luck solved consider whether this was a coincidence or was that an ingenious part of the plan to enabled the cornea to get its oxygen supply directly from the air the cornea has its own private breathing ability check the corneal structure and function the cornea is composed of 5 cell layers epithelium bowman s layer stroma descemet s membrane and endothelium the cornea protects the rest of the eye from foreign material and germs but it also acts as the eye s outermost transparent lens

to become clear transparent as it never would have had any value at all otherwise because it would be unsighted if blood had supplied the oxygen see if you agree that the cornea had to be created in a very narrow manner it is extremely specialized because transparency is of prime importance the cornea does not have blood vessels it receives nutrients via diffusion from the tear fluid at the outside and the aqueous humor at the inside and also from neurotrophins supplied by nerve fibers that innervate it wikipedia cornea consider and explain this how could unknowing unthinking unsighted evolution

that as a child thinks so is he or she know that you create your own self fulfilling prophesies about yourself your family and your kid you ll find answers after you start looking and expecting them amazingly we know it works that way but we forget to plan let each child plan to set ones own attainable goals and you reinforce this plan with your child then they ll try mightily to build upon the child s own plans and become what they plan over time hold up a standard a landmark to attain he or she wants to be bonded to you believe in you that you know about everything and you re right think clearly whatever you believe will influence them more while they are young train up a child in the way he should go even when he is old he will not depart from it proverbs 22 6 7 if you believe that your child is like a little angel then he or she will probably most of the time meet your expectations if you believe one is a little spawn of the devil from well their behavior won t be as good speak words of life into your child the bible says life and death are in the power of the tongue you can either bring death into your and your family s life or joy life peace and hope the way to speak life into your child is to seek to encourage each one to encourage means to give people courage tell your son or daughter you can do anything you set your mind to do tell each child you are a quick learner and have special qualities name some and be sure to notice when they show their talents tell them you are talented tell them you can develop your talent by practicing a little every day if you love improving your talent believe and affirm that they can be all they were meant to be and they will be tell them to try to work for what they want and to not accept the routine or mundane things of unbelief don t be overly critical of each thing one says and does show patience remember while they are small that they are not capable of nearly as much as you are if you are too harsh with them they will fear and then learn to hate you maybe they won t when they are little but watch out for the teenage years you reap what you sow so if you sow criticism and anger you will reap criticism and anger show interest in their life but not clinging to them let them have choices and then expect them to change their minds from time to time encourage them to develop continuity perseverance show interest in what they are doing in their hobbies in their friends listen you may be able to keep them out of a lot of bad behaviors and trouble if you would listen and then listen some more communication needs to go both ways listen to them about their lives more often they won t care what you know until they know that you care so show that you care and then they will be more open to your giving them advice remember that any kindness you show to your child now will be given back to you when you are older often times parents who throw their kids in childcare later in life get thrown in an old folks home by those kids however you want them to treat you when you are old treat them that way now when they are young don t believe or excuse negative reports from others about your child but never ignore the possibilities don t let people gossip to you about them but listen to them first you might learn of a problem area that needs attention then always stick up for your child their teachers may have critical things to say about them listen and ignore them the doctor might ignore it whatever things are good and true think on those things don t listen to anyone that might say they have add or adhd those labels really mean that a child is not encouraged enough to learn you as the parent need to find ways to engage them in interesting reading and learning it is your job as the parent to mold them into a model and respectable citizen of society don t medicate them to fix a problem that you could fix by being there for them more go to their sports games and practice with them if possible between times or research and suggest new but doable techniques cheer them on encourage them in every extracurricular activity that they do don t neglect your children don t ignore them if they mess up in any area of life tell them they will do better next time that is called positive affirmation and includes saying i don t only t h i n k you can learn to do be that someday i expect you to if that is what you want to do and you ll have to decide to study and then work for what you want focus more on the positives build on what they did right in a game or on an essay etc rather than pointing out only the things they need to improve thank god everyday for the beautiful children that you have realize that there are many couples who are unable to have kids due to infertility issues thank god for the things that they are good at and for how healthy they are have faith that they have a bright future and that god has amazing plans ahead for them with a future and a hope i know the plans that i have for you declares the lord plans for good and not for calamity plans to give you a future and a hope then you will call upon me and come and pray to me and i will listen to you jeremiah 29 11 ask

how to use rituals and ceremonies to overcome grief,coping with loss of any kind can seem overwhelming whether it is the loss of a loved one a job or the loss of something else you may find yourself feeling sad lonely and just plain out of sync you may wonder what you can do to work through your emotions and the grief that you are feeling there are things you can do to cope you can use rituals and ceremonies as a way to overcome your grief research has shown rituals are a helpful way to overcome grief possibly due to the sense of control that using rituals can give people 1 x research source to use this technique you need to choose the right type of ceremony or ritual plan the event and make it meaningful to you,do what feels comfortable there is no right or wrong way to grieve there is also no right or wrong type of ritual or ceremony to have to help you overcome your grief doing what feels comfortable to you will feel more authentic and help you work through your loss 2 x research source don t let anyone tell you what type of ceremony or ritual you should have to overcome your grief for example your family may tell you that you should have a private ceremony for your fish but if a public burial is what feels right to you then do that think about what will help you move through the grieving process write down what you want to get out of the ritual for instance you might write i want to do something that will celebrate my friend s life and help me remember him consider a formal event depending on the type of loss you may want to have a formal ceremony or ritual to overcome your grief the formal aspects such as specific clothing a set order of activities etc can provide you with structure and set some limits for your grief 3 x research source there are religious and community leaders that can help you or even hold a formal event for you this can reduce some of your stress for example you might say to your rabbi i d like to have a ritual for my uncle could you help me if your loss is due to the death of a loved one you may want to have a formal memorial ceremony you can also have a formal event when you are grieving for other reasons like a community center closing or a local natural disaster explore informal rituals and ceremonies they don t have to be formal events held in specific settings or on specific days a ritual or a ceremony can be anything you do to help cope with your grief 4 x research source if you don t feel up to a formal ritual or ceremony then consider informal and more casual activities you can use to overcome your grief think of activities that represent your loss use that activity as the ritual or part of it for instance if your dog recently died but used to love walking to the store then make a ritual of walking to the store once a day for a while or for example you might make a ritual of writing a daily letter to your ex in your journal until you ve gotten out all your emotions about the breakup ask for help depending on the type of ritual or ceremony you decide to have you may need assistance organizing it even if it is an informal ceremony including someone else in the planning process can help you by giving you ideas for activities helping you decide whether to include others and offering moral support if you would like to have a formal ceremony or ritual then consider asking your religious or spiritual leader for help planning and holding it you might say i d like to have a ceremony to help our family overcome our grief could you help me plan it even if you are planning a personal ritual it s okay to ask someone close to you for help you might say i m planning a ritual to help me cope with the loss of job do you have any suggestions choose when to have it ceremonies are usually held only once or every once in a while rituals can be something you do once or on a regular basis once you have decided what you want to do you can decide when you will have the ceremony or ritual and how often you will do it to help you overcome your grief 5 x research source think about when the ceremony or ritual will be most memorable and meaningful for you for instance will you have a ritual on the anniversary of your marriage or on the anniversary of your divorce being finalized ask yourself if this is something you want to do once or something you want to do on a regular basis for example do you want to have one home going ceremony for your friend or do you want to do a ritual each year on her birthday select activities that have significance rituals and ceremonies include specific activities that have importance to you and are related to your loss 6 x research source think about what activities you can include in the ritual or ceremony to help you cope with your loss including words songs or movements that have meaning to you will help you overcome grief make a list of songs that are significant to you during your loss consider playing performing or asking someone to perform one or two of them at the ceremony write a letter or speech expressing your grief if you feel comfortable you can read it during the ritual or even bury it or shred it some rituals include dance handshakes hugs and other movement based activities for instance you might decide to give a small bow to your deceased martial arts teacher when you drive past the dojo decide where to have it you may have several options of where to have your ritual or ceremony depending on what type you decide to have whether you choose a formal public ritual or an informal personal ceremony you should pick a location that has significance to you holding it in a special place will help you overcome your grief the location can be a public place like a park religious building or community center for instance you might plan a ritual at your football field to cope with the loss of your coach you can also decide to have it somewhere private like your home or even your vehicle consider including others including others in your ceremony or ritual can help you overcome your grief by providing you with emotional support 7 x research source if they are experiencing the same loss inviting others to take part in your ritual or ceremony can also help them overcome their grief this can be an opportunity to share memories or thoughts about the loss ask family and friends close to you to attend

they are from yours don t try to make them adopt your religion and don t criticize or make fun of them for their faith remember that your spouse s religion is just as important to them as yours is to you for example if your spouse is an atheist it s unfair to try to force your religious views onto them allow them the freedom to decide what they believe just as you do accept your spouse the way they are and assume they won t change if you hold out hope that your spouse will convert it could strain your marriage look for common ground between your religious traditions many religions have similar ideas at their core instead of focusing on all the ways you disagree with your spouse find the issues that you do agree on 1 x research source for instance you and your spouse might have similar ideas about treating others well or raising a family consider what similar beliefs you both have for example do you both believe in a god educate yourself about your spouse s religion show your spouse that you respect and care about their spiritual life by making an effort to understand their faith better ask them questions read their holy texts and seek out other educational resources about their religion as you learn try to understand how your spouse s faith has shaped them as a person 2 x research source for example you might ask what s a good book that can help me understand your faith to show you are trying to understand them better invite your spouse to learn more about your faith as well answer any questions they have and help them find resources for learning more participate in your spouse s religious traditions ask your spouse to bring you to their services and meet some other people in their religious community help your spouse celebrate the holidays and traditions of their religion at home 3 x research source for example you might attend services with your spouse on sundays and they might join you for mid week services at your place of worship make sure your spouse understands that you don t intend to convert explain that you are secure in your own beliefs but you want to support their faith because you love them make your spouse feel welcome in your religious spaces and traditions too help your spouse grow in faith along with you encourage your spouse to make time for their religion and live according to their beliefs consider praying or studying your religious texts together 4 x research source for instance each of you could say a prayer from your faith before a meal stay flexible sometimes you and your spouse will probably have to compromise on things that matter to you both you may never agree on certain issues but do your best to find a solution that makes you both feel respected be prepared to put your marriage first even if that means you don t always get things your own way discuss your religion with your spouse talk with your spouse about what faith means to each of you where your faith came from and what role it plays in your life stay open and non judgmental work on understanding your spouse better not turning the conversation into a debate 5 x research source for example you might say as a buddhist i am driven towards finding peace in my everyday actions my spirituality isn t just a set of rules but a way of living and being it s a good idea to have this conversation on a regular basis since people s religious beliefs and perspectives often shift throughout life discuss the future talk with your spouse about where you want your life to take you how you want to develop your faith and where you see your marriage fitting into your plan ask your spouse to share their hopes and expectations too together develop a plan that works for both of you 6 x research source you might ask for example how will we celebrate religious holidays since we have separate faiths make a plan for dealing with your differences if you and your spouse keep running into the same conflicts or incompatibilities don t ignore them figure out how to fix them think about where you can give a little ground and offer to compromise however you can don t set your beliefs aside to keep the peace though 7 x research source make sure your compromises are a joint effort if not you or your spouse will end up feeling resentful for example you might go through the calendar and decide how you will celebrate different holidays or holy weeks some you might celebrate together while you might choose to celebrate others separately consider marital counseling for interfaith couples marital counseling can be a good way to learn better communication and conflict resolution strategies consider seeing a counselor to keep your marriage strong healthy and mutually respectful 8 x research source you don t need to be having marriage problems to see a counselor counseling can help prevent major problems from occurring in the first place discuss how you will handle holidays make a plan for celebrating holidays from both of your religious traditions consider how you ll celebrate with your families as well as how you ll observe holidays at home 9 x research source for instance if you are christian and your spouse is not ask your spouse if they are comfortable having a christmas tree or hosting the family easter celebration at your house decide which religious tradition your children will be raised in most interfaith marriages get much more complicated once kids enter the picture talk with your spouse sooner rather than later about what religion your kids will be 10 x research source this is a complicated and often touchy topic be sensitive about your spouse s feelings as well as your own some parents opt to raise children in both of their religious traditions others pick only one either approach can work but both require tolerance and cooperation talk openly with your kids about religion if you have children explain both your beliefs and your spouse s beliefs to them take a positive tone towards both religions and don t try to convince your kids that yours is the right one 11 x research source regardless of the religion you re raising your kids to be it s important for them to have a positive and respectful view of both parents beliefs talk to your families it ll be easier to maintain marital harmony when both of your families are on board with your interfaith marriage explain your religion to your in laws and invite your spouse to do the same for your family make your extended family feel included by inviting them to participate in your holidays and traditions 12 x research

try to predict who will take the last donut by examining your world you develop your skills of observation 4 x research source start by gathering information about the environment and people you encounter every day be a passive observer try to make small predictions about what will happen such as who will volunteer to speak when the group is asked a question confirm your predictions with evidence 5 x research source watch people spend time watching people so that you can become practiced in noticing someone s mannerisms habits and tics choose a location like a park bench or a table in a coffee shop observe the people around you cataloguing what you notice about each person ask yourself questions such as what coffee will this person order or will this person act the same way with his friends as he was before they got here practice picking up on a person s personality or mood do puzzles expand your powers of observation by using puzzles that ask you to spot differences between photos find a hidden word or solve a maze you need a flexible mind to solve mysteries like sherlock holmes and puzzles will get you one step closer to that goal pick up a sudoku book or print out free crossword puzzles from the internet challenge yourself to complete a human maze go alone so that your friends won t help you solve the puzzle notice details if you want to have good intuition you need to train yourself to notice details when sherlock goes to a crime scene he notices the minute details that no one else did that s because he s practiced that skill you can be just like sherlock if you train yourself to notice details 6 x research source test your powers of observation by listing what you can remember about the places you ve been for example after you go to lunch at a local restaurant list what you can remember about the place what does the decor look like what are the uniforms like what dishes are on the menu next time you go to that restaurant compare your list to see what you remembered correctly continue to test yourself to see how well you are noticing details write it down keep a record of your observations and add to it daily don t feel discouraged if you spend a lot of time in the same places because you can still challenge yourself to make new observations 7 x research source push yourself to focus on particular details for example you could decide to look for people who are wearing a red shirt or people carrying an umbrella on your commute try counting people who fit into a similar category for example if you ride the train you could count the number of people playing on their cell phones at the doctor s office you could track how many people read the magazines the office provides versus how many people bring items with them read body

someone is lying part of having good intuition is being able to spot a liar so learning how to detect when someone is lying to you is essential if you want to develop your intuition you must be able to spot the truths and the lies people who are lying often cover their nose and mouth they may also twirl their hair or tug on their clothes while it may take time learning to spot micro expressions in a person s face can also help you figure out if a person is lying watch for inexplicable sweating for example if the person starts sweating in an air conditioned room then they may be lying listen to the speed at which a person speaks slow or fast speech can indicate lying predict what others will do use your skills to predict how others will behave for example you could predict who will forget

believe and that logic is the only way to go but you can see through sherlock s mysteries that it s best to use both sides of your minds because your intuition relies on training and gathered information it s not as fantastical as it sounds rather it s a way of forming hypotheses based on knowledge experiences and attention to details well practiced intuition will enable you to make quicker decisions without thinking through all of the details because your brain builds a network of connections that process the information for you as a result you will arrive at the right decision

reactions but training yourself to think objectively will have you unraveling secrets like sherlock 9 x research source let the facts guide you not your opinions for example if someone stole your lunch it may be tempting to blame someone with whom you ve had negative run ins in the past but don t rush to judgement the facts may point to someone else keep an open mind listen to the opinions and views of others so that you can learn from their perspective we all see the world differently and sometimes you need that shift in vision to stay objective participate while sometimes you may need to act like a bystander a strong intuition requires you to have to be engaged with those around you just like sherlock needs to analyze the conditions of the scene of a crime to know what happened you need to be a part of your world in order to make useful judgements about it 10 x research source play an active role in your life instead of sitting apart from others so that you can gain experience that will help you flex your intuition make a point to do an activity everyday even if it s something small for example you could go on a walk with a friend play a pickup game of basketball sketch on a park bench or practice a new language minimize the time you spend watching television take in the environment mentally catalogue the sights and sounds around you knowing the world around you will help you make better decisions in the moment how you will react to someone will differ based on the scene for example if someone is walking toward you in a shopping mall you may nod at them and keep walking however if someone is walking toward you in a dark alleyway you may tense up and try to keep your distance from them while you don t want to jump to conclusions knowing your environment will help you read the situation better because you ll more easily pick up on cues minimize distractors if you want to have a strong intuition like sherlock then you need to stay engaged with your world distractors such as playing on your phone keep you from taking in the information you need to use your intuition spend two weeks noting the times you found yourself giving in to distraction such as watching tv while eating dinner playing on your phone while you re going to work or flipping through a magazine while your friend is talking to you be a skeptic while it may seem counter intuitive healthy skepticism keeps you from jumping to conclusions based on your own prejudices to be a good skeptic you need to understand your own beliefs and how they influence your reactions to the world around you so that you avoid misjudgements based on your own biases 11 x trustworthy source greater good magazine journal published by uc berkeley s greater good science center which uses scientific research to promote happier living go to source when you find yourself reacting to something or someone take a moment to ask yourself why you feel that way for example if you feel uncomfortable around your friend s new boyfriend ask yourself if it s because of him or because of outside factors does he remind you of your ex are you worried that you might lose your friend don t immediately believe gossip look for the evidence and use it to judge the truthfulness of any rumors that you hear think outside the box in order to have intuition like sherlock holmes you need to be a creative and reflexive thinker if you build habits resist change and try to categorize the world then you won t be able to train your mind to capture and process the reality of the world around you 12 x research source try brainstorming activities like making a mind map doodling or making a list go somewhere different for example take a notebook to a coffee shop you ve never tried or go on a nature walk collaborate with others to create joint ideas do something artistic change your routine to shift your point of view learn to do one task at a time multi tasking is the enemy of intuition because it distracts your mind and keeps it from concentrating on the world around you your mind needs full and accurate information in order to reach the correct conclusions 13 x research source understand deduction sherlock holmes solves his crimes by following the principles of deduction which is a method used to reach a conclusion based on a guiding theory sherlock creates his theories based on the connections he makes using his observational skills and personal knowledge 14 x research source deduction relies on the principle that all things in a particular group have the same rules for example if everyone in the conference room has won a prize and tom is in the conference room then we know that tom is a prizewinner 15 x research source build a theory a master of deduction builds a theory upon evidence which then allows them to draw solid conclusions based on their theories 16 x research source look for patterns in your life pay attention to the who what where why when and how for example document who you see making the office coffee you may discover that the only person who makes coffee before 8 am is the office accountant lily make generalizations using your evidence according to this pattern you can generalize that all coffee made before 8 am is made by lily based on this theory if there is no coffee after 8 am then lily has not come into work test your theory once you ve built a theory based on generalizations see if your theory holds true in the example above the next time 8 am passes and there is no coffee check to see if lily is out of the office sharpen your problem solving skills you need to improve your problem solving abilities so that you can use deduction to make better decisions to use deduction you need to be good at working out the solution to a problem start by defining your problem and understanding the facts gather and analyze information list out possible solutions and examine the qualities of each one think logically you must learn to think logically if you are going to develop your intuition for your intuition to be accurate it needs to be trained to react based on logic look for relationships between causes and effects 17 x research source for example if your friend drinks more cups of coffee on thursdays then ask yourself what s different about that day she may stay up late on wednesday because she s taking a night class collect more information to determine if it s cause and effect or a correlation which means that the two things are related but one is not causing the other be careful not to assume that a relationship between two things will be true in reverse while a late class may cause your friend to drink more coffee the next day that does not mean that every time your friend drinks a lot of coffee she has been to a night class 18 x research source expand your knowledge to have strong intuition like sherlock you have to keep learning read books watch documentaries keep up with the news and join groups that help you further your knowledge you don t have to go to a formal school to learn something new 19 x research source don t limit yourself in what you study for example knowing pop culture might not seem important but it can help you understand the people around you so it will help you better rely on your intuition try edx org which offers classes from major institutions like harvard berkeley georgetown mit and other prestigious universities you can take a class for free to learn from the world s best or you can pay a small fee to get a certification that you took that course either way it s a great opportunity to expand your knowledge check out sites like meetup com which offer community run groups some groups will connect you with people who can teach you new skills for example you may be able to learn how to build a website cook indian food or combine essential oils relax once you ve successfully trained your brain you need to relax and give it time to

around us the idea of the sixth sense is that in addition to these fundamental five humans also have a sixth sense that s attuned to subtler non physical sensations that aren t obvious or perceptible

form of quick information processing and it s a skill that can be developed with practice and attention 2 x research source the ability to use intuition develops out of repeated exposure to various

variations and the more attuned you become with the world around you 8 x research source enhancing your perception this way helps you to notice subtle shifts and changes in your environment and eventually to anticipate certain things before they happen for example imagine a street you travel frequently try to imagine it in as close and as much precise detail as you can where are the various shops located which traffic signs are posted what are the parking regulations what kind of landscaping does the street have write down as many details as you re able to remember then go visit that street and carefully fill in the blanks in your memory write down a detailed description of what you see later test yourself to see how accurately you remembered the details you wrote down learn to notice and absorb this level of detail wherever you go record what you see teach yourself to focus your attention outward rather than inward doing so will help you develop sensitivity to what goes on around you and will teach you to quiet your own thoughts and preoccupations when necessary take a notebook with you when you go places note what you see and sense in as much detail as possible make this a regular practice until you find yourself doing it automatically with or without the notebook learn to watch and listen closely when talking with someone train yourself to put your full attention on them when you learn to observe someone closely and attentively you often learn to pick up on small nearly imperceptible cues that will indicate what the person is truly feeling or thinking note small variations in their tone and inflection watch the movement of their eyes and the contraction or dilation of their pupils pay attention to the words they choose and notice the pauses and silences between their words exercise your non visual senses we tend to rely on our sight to interpret the world around us so much so that sight can come to predominate over our other senses but if you consciously work on prioritizing senses other than sight you can begin to perceive more subtle variations in the environment of which you were previously unaware try closing your eyes and using your other senses to perceive people as they walk by note the sound of their clothing footfalls and breathing note their smell note the subtle changes in the air around them as they move note any temperature changes that occur as they pass see if you can detect where their attention is directed and if you can tell when their attention falls on you as you become more sensitive to people and the energy they give off see if you can notice the particular type of energy of each person who passes can you pick up on any tension or on any negative or positive energy try to assess the energy of rooms you walk into can you sense any positive or negative energy direct your thought outward when you re overly focused on the running dialogue in your own head you easily miss what s going on with other people and things in the world around you when you find yourself caught up in your own head consciously turn your focus outward and notice the people places and things around you quiet your mind by telling yourself that you don t need to think about whatever is going on in your head instead decide to be quiet and serene develop a meditation practice part of learning to be attuned to the world around you is learning to quiet your own mind and calmly observe meditation trains your mind to move away from its normal freneticism and to tap into your body s inner calm begin by finding a calm place where you can sit quietly close your eyes and begin paying attention to the sounds smells and physical sensations around you breathe deeply and regularly focusing on breathing through your diaphragm and noticing the pause between each breath when random thoughts pop into your mind gently and calmly let them go don t follow them gradually build up the length of time you spend meditating at first you may only practice for 5 minutes a day gradually build up to 10 minutes a day then 15 then 20 take a walk going for regular reflective walks can be an excellent way to get out of your conscious mind and into a more intuitive sensory state find a quiet calm place to walk many people feel that being close to nature helps connect you to a place that s bigger than you which helps you become more attuned to the world around you and less fixated on your conscious and rational mind as you walk intentionally turn your attention outward focus on what you see smell taste and touch try to pick up the smallest sounds you can pay close attention to small changes in the landscape try to sense the smallest changes in temperature wind and pressure keep a notebook in which you record the things you perceive take note of what you observe and how you react to those perceptions,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to follow your intuition,intuition is knowing something without being able to explain how you came to that conclusion rationally 1 x research source it s that mysterious gut feeling or instinct

rationalization or your judgmental inner voice stream of consciousness writing or just jotting down the first word or thought that pops into your head can help you become more aware of what s going on in your subconscious mind 2 x research source meditate meditation can help you become more in tune with the intuitive signals your body is sending you try some basic meditation techniques to help you become more mindful of your physical state 3 x research source find a quiet and comfortable place to meditate where you will not be bothered or distracted sit in a comfortable position close your eyes and focus on the sensations of your own breathing if your mind wanders gently redirect your attention to your breathing try doing a body scan lie down close your eyes and mentally focus on each part of your body in turn starting with the toes and moving up to the top of your head be aware of any sensations you are experiencing in each part of your body and make a conscious effort to relax any tensed muscles when you are done focus on your entire body for a few minutes take a few minutes to focus on your breathing distract yourself while it may seem illogical distraction can actually help you come to a decision your brain processes information on a subconscious level even if you are not actively focusing on it or thinking about it if you find yourself struggling to make a decision do something else for a while then return to the problem and go with the decision that feels right 4 x research source sleep on it sleep is important for resting and repairing our bodies and minds and it also helps process information that we take in during the day if you re having trouble making a decision try putting it aside and getting some sleep when you wake up you may find that your intuition has led you to a decision 5 x research source use your knowledge and common sense if you are in an unfamiliar situation trying to solve a complex problem or need to make an important decision do some research or seek advice before letting your gut take over your intuition will work better for you if you use it along with practical knowledge reasonable expectations and an understanding of your options listen to your intuition in familiar situations our brains are great at recognizing patterns this allows us to come to decisions quickly and without much conscious thought you have probably used this type of intuition while driving or riding a bicycle once you ve practiced something a few times like giving a speech performing a musical piece or playing a sport try letting go and letting your intuition take over instead of referring to your notes looking at the clock or thinking about every step 6 x research source listen to your instincts about people our gut reactions to other people are a survival instinct if you find yourself in a situation where you feel fearful of or nervous about another person for no obvious reason you may be picking up on subtle signs that are not apparent to your conscious mind be on guard when interacting with someone who gives you a bad feeling even if you re not sure why if you feel like you are in immediate danger remove yourself from the situation or seek help 7 x research source listen to your instincts about your health you know your body better than anyone else if you feel that something is wrong even if it s subtle or you can t clearly explain it seek medical advice or attention if you still feel like your concerns have not been addressed after seeing a medical professional get a second opinion you may be picking up on something your doctor hasn t 8 x research source you may also develop a strong intuition about the health needs of people you are close to if you are the parent or guardian of a child or if you live with someone who has health problems pay attention to your intuitive signals about their condition you may get the sense that something is wrong even if they do not bring it to your attention or notice it themselves let your intuition help you with big decisions if you re faced with a big choice like making a major purchase deciding which college to go to or getting married logic and practical considerations are important but once you ve weighed all the pros and cons and narrowed down your options you are likely to get the most satisfaction out of your choice if you let intuition guide you to a final decision 9 x research source listen to your gut it s not just a metaphor we really do some of our thinking with our guts your gut brain may let you know that you re stressed or excited before your mind does by giving you a stomach ache a feeling of butterflies in your stomach or that distinctive sinking feeling that you get when you hear bad news 10 x research source if your stomach hurts or feels uncomfortable when you re dealing with or even thinking about particular situations or people this is may be your body telling you that they are a source of stress for you be aware of these signals and take a break or avoid the triggering situation or person if possible follow your nose you may not always be aware of it but your sense of smell can be a powerful survival tool your nose can tell you if something is unsafe to eat and can even help you evaluate another person s emotional or physical state boost your sense of smell by exercising regularly and avoiding pollutants that damage your sense of smell like cigarette smoke 11 x research source use your eyes when you enter an unfamiliar situation take a quick look around even if you aren t consciously aware of everything you re seeing your eyes may pick up on important visual cues that can contribute to intuitive responses for example you may subconsciously pick up on subtle changes in another person s facial expressions or body language beyond what is immediately obvious if something seems amiss or alarming about a person or situation it might be because your eyes noticed something that your mind didn t 12 x research source pay attention to your physical reactions dangerous or uncomfortable situations may trigger a physical stress response in addition to an upset stomach you might feel your palms sweating and your heart racing in some cases our bodies pick up on the signs that something is amiss before our brains do listen to what your body is telling you these stress reactions are a signal to the conscious mind to be on guard 13 x research source,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to be more perceptive,perception refers to the way we understand and interpret the information we sense and take in often it also refers to the things we sense but cannot explain learn to be more perceptive by reading people s body language by trusting your gut by being a perceptive listener and by practicing meditation,learn about body language ninety percent of human communication is non verbal a person s body language can be voluntary or involuntary and it is both genetic and learned it is a strong indicator of how a person feels but it can vary from one culture to the next those discussed in this article are indicators of body language in western cultures 1 x research source understand the six facial expressions psychologists have classified six involuntary facial expressions that they consider to be nearly universal across cultures they are happiness sadness surprise fear disgust and anger each has its own signals or clues and can reveal a person s feelings but remember they are often fleeting and some people mask them well 2 x research source happiness is exhibited by a raising or lowering of the corners of the mouth sadness is shown by a lowering of the corners of the mouth and by the raising of the inner portions of one s eyebrows surprise can be seen when eyebrows arch eyes open wide to expose more white area and when the jaw drops slightly fear is revealed through the raising of eyebrows when eyes open after being shut or narrowed and when the mouth opens slightly disgust is displayed when the upper lip raises the bridge of the nose wrinkles and cheeks raise anger exhibits itself when eyebrows lower lips press together firmly and eyes bulge know what eye movements mean many believe that eyes are the windows to the soul this belief drove many psychological and cognitive researchers to investigate if our involuntary eye movements held meaning research has shown our eyes make predictable movements when a person is processing a thought or question the notion that you can tell if someone is lying based upon the direction of his or her eye movement however is a myth here s what we do know 3 x research source eye movements in any direction increase when a person is recalling information our eye movements stop when something interests us we also avert our gaze when thinking through something such as the answer to a question and our eyes stop moving when we re trying to shut out distractions and focus eyes move from left to right or vice versa when we are either problem solving or processing and recalling information and the harder the problem the more your eyes move 4 x research source 5 x research source eyes blink at a normal rate of 6 8 times per minute when a person is under stress that number rises dramatically raised eyebrows not only show fear but also genuine interest in a topic furrowed eyebrows signal confusion 6 x research source look at the way a person s mouth moves researchers say the mouth s movements reveal a great deal about how a person feels pursing your lips for example is a sign of anger 7 x research source happiness as discussed is displayed when the corners of the mouth curve up however researchers have found that different smiles mean different things natural spontaneous smiles appear gradually last briefly and are shown repetitively genuine delight is expressed by a series of short smile bursts and creases that form at the corners of the eyes fake smiles are about 10 times larger than natural spontaneous ones they also appear suddenly last longer than a natural smile and disappear abruptly 8 x research source observe head movements a person tilts his or her head when actively listening to a topic that interests him or her nodding your head indicates you are interested in the topic and want the other person to continue talking and rubbing one s forehead or earlobes indicates a person feels uneasy nervous or vulnerable 9 x research source 10 x research source watch hand and arm movements people move their hands and arms more than normal when they are speaking or answering a question 11 x research source they also touch both things and other people more when they respond to intimate questions or when they are physically close to others hiding your hands like in your pockets or behind your back can indicate deceit crossing your arms doesn t always indicate anger but it can be a defensive posture it can also mean you feel uneasy with the other person 12 x research source notice body posture and movements learning toward another person is a relaxed and interested indicator friendly feelings exist leaning in too close on the other hand can be experienced as a hostile or dominating gesture angling yourself toward another person while you re both standing signals respect it s also often a sign of deference 13 x research source adopting postures similar to others tends to increase group or interpersonal rapport it tells others you are open to their thoughts standing with your legs wide apart is either a traditional stance for those in positions of power or a dominating position 14 x research source a slumped posture indicates boredom alienation or feeling ashamed an upright posture asserts confidence but it also can exude hostility or a sense of uprightness relax and become aware of what you re hearing studies show that talking elevates a person s blood pressure listening brings it back down listening relaxes us which allows us to pay attention to our surroundings and those in it 15 x research source perceptive listening goes beyond actively listening which focuses on listening to another person reflecting on what he or she says and sharing your thoughts it also requires you to think about what the other person is thinking and how he or she acts while talking 16 x research source it demands focus and being mindful of and present in the conversation by paying close attention to cues from the other person and providing feedback relevant to the discussion remember that listening requires interpretation the need to interpret information limits people in their ability to understand what a message means these interpretations are often dictated by a person s life experiences therefore they are also limited by these experiences this leaves a lot of room for error in understanding what another person means 17 x research source master perceptive listening listening is not an involuntary automatic response to hearing what someone is saying it involves a conscious effort on your part and requires practice foremost is that you respect the speaker as a human being who deserves to be heard an effective listener will validate and empower others this improves the relationship and often leads to future discussions that are straight forward and detailed here are some tips to being a more effective listener focus your attention shut out distractions and listen closely to what s said you cannot assess a statement s logic or the speaker s true intentions if you re unfocused 18 x research source respond to what s said so the speaker feels heard and believes you understand what he or she is saying this feedback also allows you to clear up any misinterpretations in your processing don t interrupt when providing feedback wait for natural breaks in the conversation and for cues from the speaker such as does that make sense ask questions at appropriate times to draw out what the speaker might not have said otherwise 19 x research source pay attention to the speaker s mannerisms and tone and what they might mean consider the context within which the message is delivered and observe what is not said meaning is not always openly expressed 20 x research source don t fill silences simply to avoid them give the person time to think through what he or she is thinking and wants to say be open minded to messages that you do not agree with e g prejudicial comments and opposing viewpoints allow the speaker to fully explain him or herself seek to understand and interpret a message s meaning by using the cues you ve been paying attention to and by drawing on your experiences make a conscious and active effort to remember what s said retaining information is necessary for assessing its relationship to other aspects of the conversation in the moment it s also needed to later process the information which alone can alter your perception and handling of related situations 21 x research source avoid roadblocks that prevent perceptive listening try not to ask why questions because this can make people feel defensive avoid advising the person about what you think should be done unless you re asked don t make quick reassurances such as don t worry about that the latter can indicate you re not fully listening or taking the discussion seriously 22 x research source practice perceptive listening in other areas of your life listen to the sounds around you and observe how they make you feel notice when you aren t noticing sounds and stop close your eyes relax and focus the more you do this the more you will become aware of the world around you this will also help you detect odd unusual and pleasing sounds and become more perceptive about their meanings in addition to the situations that might accompany them 23 x research source understand intuition and its role in your life most people have at some point experienced a gut feeling it seems to arise from nowhere but is quite distinct gut feelings make people feel in any number of ways they can also cause a person to sense and know things without any logical explanation and at times they spur a person to do things he or she might not otherwise 24 x research source the famous psychotherapist carl jung said that all people use intuition as one of the four ways we function in life the other three are feeling thinking and sensing this makes intuition distinct and not determined by the others 25 x research source even though many people dismiss intuition as being either nonsense or luck scientists are now saying it s a very real ability that s been identified in lab settings and on bran scans 26 x research source discover traits of the intuitive person researchers say that everyone is born with intuition but not everyone is open to believing in it or willing to listen to it and some people are more intuitive than others that may be because they were naturally born with a heightened awareness it could be because they ve seen it work in their lives and it might be because along the way they learned to notice and pick up on subtle cues from others and the environment often those who are very intuitive are also particularly people focused they are more easily able to sense what others are feeling they re generally more emotionally oriented than analytical they frequently make decisions quickly and efficiently they re able to do this because they use past experiences and emotions to guide them women are often more intuitive than men citation needed this could be the result of an evolutionary process that s made women particularly conscious of human responses and social stimuli and there is evidence that some people can go a step beyond what s even normal in this realm there s documentation of people knowing events have occurred far away even though they have no prior knowledge of the event or factual basis to explain how they knew 27 x research source recognize some of the signs scientific studies have shown that highly intuitive people experience changes in their heart rate and get sweaty palms when they are exposed to deceit they believe it is a response to the stress of subconsciously knowing or suspecting they were being tricked this seems to indicate that our instincts kick in and cause physical sensations first our minds catch up quickly but second 28 x research source learn to become more intuitive though intuition varies there are things you can do to become more intuitive if you practice and have an open mind the most basic way is to still calm your mind so you can a listen to your inner voice and b learn to be more observant of your environment and the people in it pay attention to sensations that seem to come out of the blue and have no logical explanation our brain s amygdala which generates the fight or flight instinct is able to activate process and respond to cues and information before we are consciously aware they exist it can also process images and initiate our response to them that pass before our eyes so fast that we cannot even see them researchers believe this stems from our very ancient ancestors need to quickly gather and assess information if they wanted to survive get plenty of rem sleep during rem our brains problem solve connect pieces of information and are most in tune with emotions before you go to sleep write down a problem or worry you have think about it for a bit and then let your brain come up with an intuitive solution during rem distract your conscious mind so your intuitive mind has a chance to do its work research shows that our intuitive mind processes information even when we re not consciously paying attention to that information in fact the decisions a person makes when distracted have been shown to often be the correct ones if you have a problem or concern think through your options then stop and concentrate on something else go with the first solution that comes to you 29 x research source check your gut decisions against the facts growing scientific evidence supports the wisdom of many intuitive decisions issues such as extreme distress can distort that intuitive processing though and lead to bad decision making gut reactions and hunches are not always accurate a smart approach is to listen to your gut and at the same time evaluate what it s telling you against the evidence also factor in your emotions were they extreme when you got the gut feeling 30 x research source meditate to improve perception buddhists have been practicing meditation for more than 2 500 years now roughly 10 of americans meditate as well several studies have been conducted showing that meditation can significantly improve perception participants in one study were able to detect small visual variations they had abnormally long attention spans as well 31 x research source another demonstrated that the regions in the brain associated with a sensitivity to body signals and b sensory processing have increased grey matter when a person regularly meditates 32 x research source grey matter is a type of tissue in the central nervous system that processes information and triggers a sensory response to it 33 x research source it is believed that meditating creates more neural connections in the prefrontal cortex of the brain this region processes sensory information handles rational decision making and regulates the amygdala teaching yourself to relax to tune things out and to be receptive rather than reactive to the moment enhances your ability to receive cues around you 34 x research source learn about the types of meditation meditation is an

coincidences may very well be signals of what s going on in your subconscious mind taking time every day to clear your mind for example through meditation or mindful walking will help you recognize

reminds you of a previous person or experience you ve had you re likely to associate it with the same emotions good or bad that you had in the past for this reason you should still question your intuition because it may be bringing up associations from a past experience that may not be relevant to your current situation 14 x research source gather experiences research suggests that intuition is mostly about matching patterns based on experience and knowledge for this reason your intuition is more reliable in areas in which you have more experience 15 x research source travel socialize and

but just socially awkward or perhaps from a different culture you don t have to become close friends or share your deepest secrets in fact if you have a bad feeling about them definitely don t do those things over time you ll get to know them better and will be better able to judge whether your intuition was right ask yourself whether it s worth expressing your hunches some hunches are best left unsaid for the sake of your relationships if you do decide to test whether your hunch is correct by bringing it up with a friend partner colleague choose your wording wisely for example if you have a hunch that your partner thinks someone else is attractive but there isn t any danger of them actually acting on those feelings it might be best to let them have their crush instead of accusing them of liking someone else and getting into a fight 21 x research source as long as it s only a passing attraction and nothing more it s perfectly natural don t dwell on the negative if you re prone

how to tell the difference between fear and intuition,some fears are capable of causing you to belittle yourself or to misinterpret danger not all fear is realistic or beneficial at the same time confusing unrealistic fears with intuition can cause a dogged determination to make yourself believe that something negative is about to pass in your life doing so is to confuse both fear and intuition and this can lead you to make choices and decisions that restrict rather than broaden your life a fulfilling life is one of balance and equality your fears and intuition will serve you well when balanced too,consider the properties of real fear fears can be real for instance when facing an impending dog attack or seeing a car hurtling towards our own as we re driving or when we re about to skydive from an airplane in these cases taking evasive or careful action based on our fear of what is about to happen is both real and sensible and are what we can term a protective fear these are healthy and normal fears 1 x research source distinguish real fear from f e a r s fears can also be unrealistic and unhealthy the acronym for which is false evidence appearing real such as when we imagine things that might happen if certain circumstances were to come to be no matter how wild our preoccupations or how stretched the possibilities in this case it s about letting anxiety worry and catastrophization take the place of clear headed thinking and evidence 2 x research source when comparing intuition and fear sensations of real fear is not what this article is concerned with rather the focus is on imagined fears the supposition that something bad is about to happen for reasons that are barely fathomable ask yourself if anything is happening at that very moment that should cause real concern use this to determine if a fear is real or imagined take stock of what makes you afraid writing down your fears can help you begin to take better notice of them as fears and not as intuitive insights simply make time to sit down with a notepad and pen and write down the fears that are currently looming large in your life they may be such things as 3 x research source fear of losing a job fear of losing someone you love fear of injury or fear for your children s safety fear of aging or fear for the future write down all the fears that occur to you some of your fears will be rational such as a fear of losing your job if your boss said that there will be layoffs next week other fears will be irrational such as fearing that a bridge will collapse on you if you drive under it just because you read of such an incident happening somewhere else 4 x research source be skeptical of long standing fears some fears often develop into phobias like fear of heights insects strangers etc these phobias are born of a particular experience and are very narrow moments in the past directing your thoughts not your intuition while these phobias are initially based on protective fears they can often end up over protecting you to the point of preventing growth freedom and happiness 5 x research source intuitive fears are generally not repetitive like a phobia and they tend to have concrete evidence supporting them eliminate stress from the equation stress and anxiety can prevent you from taking time out without taking time out you will find it hard to rediscover your sense of self or your essence and this is when fears can dominate and take over because you re trying to protect yourself from being worn out burned out and used up make the time to rejuvenate so that you can let go of fears listen to your intuition properly and make amazing personal discoveries that won t surface without taking time to relax and regroup 6 x research source reflect on what you understand by intuition it s not easily defined however it is possible to reach your own understanding of intuition as an inner guidance a knowing or an internal compass in contrast to fear intuition has positive connotations in that it helps us make our way through life by drawing upon experience that may be buried deep in our consciousness 7 x research source such terms as gut feeling instinct hunch and just a feeling are often used to describe the way our intuition influences our actions and decisions however it is very important to realize that intuition is more than just responding at an instinctual level it is instinct plus cognitive consideration there is no right or wrong answer as to how you define intuition the best approach is to simply sit down and write out what it means to you understand what happens when you mistake fear for intuition fear is a negative emotion that expresses itself through physical reactions such as fight or flight sweating feeling an adrenaline rush etc intuition is a positive set of feelings or guidance that if heeded can bring about better situations for us fear is an emotion that causes us to want to run away hide and not face the oncoming negative happening whereas intuition is about heeding the possible dangers but having the strength resilience and wherewithal to focus our actions and attitude so as to face and deal with the negative occurrence 8 x research source as such when you mistake fear for intuition you are effectively telling yourself that something bad is about to occur but that you are powerless to do anything constructive about it other than worry fret or pray thereby disabling your intuition and your ability to push past the fear this is an attempt to either sideline intuition or to change its positive effect into a negative one 9 x research source another problem with confusing fear and intuition is that instead of living in the present as intuition does you are living in a worst possible future where irrational fear resides if you re not focusing on the present then you re not being intuitive listen to premonitions premonitions of something happening in the future tend to be neutral when sourced from the intuition they cannot be forced and whether they have a good or bad outcome is not colored by your own inner thinking not everyone experiences premonitions and in fact those who block the ability through a cynical attitude towards them generally have very little chance of doing so however premonitions differ from fear in that they are not based in your subjective conscious or unconscious preferences or concerns 10 x research source differentiate between irrational fears and legitimate intuitions throughout this article you ve been given indicators on how to do this for example are you concerned with the present or are you worrying about the future are you catastrophizing or philosophizing here are some key elements of the differences between experiencing intuition versus an irrational fear 11 x research source a reliable intuition conveys information in neutral less emotional terms a reliable intuition feels right at a gut level a reliable intuition feels compassionate and affirming of yourself and others a reliable intuition gives clear impressions that are seen before they re felt a reliable intuition feels somewhat detached similar to being in a theater watching a movie an irrational fear conveys information in highly emotional terms an irrational fear is usually repetitive and an irrational viewpoint an irrational fear does not feel right at a gut level an irrational fear feels cruel belittling or delusional either toward yourself or toward others perhaps both an irrational fear does not feel centered or in perspective an irrational fear reflects past psychological wounds or traumas that have not been healed take appropriate steps you need to heed protective fears and transform irrational fears with courage at times you may foresee real danger but more frequently unproductive fears are misinforming you therefore as a general rule train yourself to question fears tied to low self esteem we re all worthy of the extraordinary for example it s right to question the fear that you re too emotionally damaged to love even the severely wounded can open up their hearts again but they need to make the choice to be open and to decide not to continue being over protective of themselves true intuitions will never put you down or support destructive attitudes and behavior of all the signs this is the most telling,Philosophy-and-Religion

thinking singing etc some prayers are recited from memory or read from a book while other prayers are more like conversations you may open the prayer by calling on the god s or deity s you are praying to and asking for help or whatever your intention there is no wrong way to go about it if a memorized prayer or chant delivers the point of your intended message there is no need to go about searching

items when you pray such as candles a bible the remains of a loved one or other items which are significant to you have these available and respectfully placed plan to pray alone or with others you

whatever tongue you speak do your best and he will understand try to pray with others jews prefer to pray more often and in groups other than christian prayer which is more individually focused pray with others if you can this can be at temple with your family at home or while you are out with your friends know each of the prayers for the different rituals instead of individually stated prayers said each day jews prefer to say blessings for different times of day events and times of year you will want to learn the different prayers and when they should be spoken as well as the holy days

is okay you can pray in the christian method above and your god will understand he cares more about your devotion and obedience pray at the right times muslims pray at specific times of day and you will need to learn and observe these times you can look them up ask your imam or get a handy app or program for your mobile device or computer orient yourself you will need to face mecca when you pray this is an important part of prayer for muslims you will need to look up what the proper direction is for the area in which you live alternatively you can get an app or program for your phone or computer which will act as a compass and point you in the right direction no matter where you are sit stand and motion correctly there are specific ways that muslims are supposed to sit stand bow and move their hands and bodies during prayer these can be rather complicated and you may need to do some research you can also learn by watching fellow muslims either out and about or at your local mosque open your prayer begin your prayer in the proper way muslim prayer is much more specific and rigid than christian prayer the standard opening is to call allahu akbar and then recite the isteftah dua optional and surah al fatiha recite the surahs recite the surahs appropriate to the time of day or that are being recited by your fellows nearby if you are alone you can recite whatever surahs you believe are appropriate perform the appropriate number of rakats the rakats or cycles of prayer are standardized and a different number of cycles is prescribed for each time of day know

wa barakatuhu the angel who records your good deeds is to this side then turn your head to the left and say as salam alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu the angel who records your wrongful deeds is to this side now your prayers are over look for signs that god has heard you when you are done praying as you progress through your day and further on look for signs that god has heard your prayers keep your heart open and look for ways in which he seeks to lead you on the appropriate path you will know in your heart what is right do right by him and keep your promises if you promised god that you would improve yourself or work harder for something you should keep your promise work as hard as you can honestly and with humility and god will understand and be pleased pray regularly don t just pray when you have a really big problem god is not your band aid pray all the time and show him the respect that he deserves get in the habit and with time you will be great at praying help and pray

how to lead worship,leading worship is an important part of any church service effective leadership will encourage the congregation to join you in meaningful heartfelt prayer and praise,know your purpose know what worship is and is not worship should be all about praising god and as a worship leader your main purpose is to encourage the entire congregation to praise god through song and prayer instead of modeling personal worship on stage focus on leading community worship worship is not a time to show off your own talents or worry about making yourself look good you may not mean to glorify yourself but pride often finds its way in undetected so keep a watchful eye out for it pray 1 x research source give thanks to god for the opportunity to lead others in the act of worshiping him and ask for the guidance humility and courage to make the worship session a good one a few things worth considering as you pray may include understanding of the lyrics you sing and the ability to convey that understanding love for the people you lead wisdom in selecting the songs and verses used for worship the ability to act on the truths you sing and speak the humility to lead in a way that glorifies god instead of yourself or the congregation the ability to guide the congregation to an improved relationship with god build your worship around the lesson find out from the pastor what that week s lesson will be about and try to choose songs around that theme doing so will make the entire service more cohesive and meaningful you ll also need to pick out short scriptural verses that go along with the songs and the overall lesson as well pick songs that others can sing 2 x research source the idea is to get others to actively participate in worship by singing along if the congregation doesn t feel comfortable singing that songs you ve chosen they probably won t sing people generally don t sing songs that are unfamiliar to them stick primarily with songs you know the congregation will know when you introduce a new song plan on including it in multiple worship services so that people will have more opportunity to get used to it also note that some songs are meant for solo singers while others are more suited to group singing obviously the songs you use for group worship should be songs that groups of people can sing together you may have a superb vocal range but know that most people do not share that same skill the songs you pick need to fall within a shorter more concentrated range so that more people can sing along consider the format know how many songs you need to pick out in many churches there is already some set order to the service in others you may have a little more flexibility regardless you should pick out enough songs to fit the format and select the right songs for the right parts of the service memorize 3 x research source know the lyrics to the songs you plan on singing memorize any verses you plan on saying you can have an open bible or sheet music in front of you during the service but it s best not to rely on them as you practice saying these readings emphasize verbs instead of pronouns adjectives and adverbs verbs typically convey the greatest amount action and meaning so emphasizing them can help draw out the truth of the text learning the words you ll be singing and saying beforehand will make you feel much more comfortable during public worship which will allow you to lead worship in a more natural manner practice you might be the only one leading worship at church then again you might have an entire worship team to work with no matter how many people are involved it is crucial that you practice the songs you plan on singing a few times before you have to perform them at church make sure that everyone on your worship team knows when each song will be sung try to keep everyone as informed as possible so that there are no surprises listen to the input of others on your worship team if the general consensus goes against your initial opinion rethink your ideas and consider altering them as needed energize yourself before the service worship is a spiritual thing but as a physical being you also need to keep your physical strength up get a full night s sleep the night before hydrate yourself and eat enough that morning to give yourself the energy you ll need to make it through the service if you re the sort of person who easily gets sick on a full stomach make sure that you only eat enough to wake yourself up and not enough to make yourself feel queasy warm up before the service meet up with any other members of the worship team before the service to do one final quick practice session as a worship leader try to show up 15 minutes or so before the rest of the worship team is due to arrive for your final practice during that time do sound tests to make sure that the equipment is set up tune any instruments you ll be using and flip through your notes to make sure that everything is in order 4 x research source watch your body language your body language needs to convey energy and sincerity even though worship is not about you you ll still need to have enough of a stage presence to catch the congregation s attention if you don t seem excited about worship those you re leading probably won t get excited either 5 x research source consider asking someone to take a video of you as you lead worship watch that video later and review your body language note which movements seem awkward or distracting and which are helpful make sure that you look the part too you need to look clean and your clothes and accessories should be neat modest and understated maintain good posture and make eye contact during the service smile when appropriate and keep a friendly yet strong presence watch the congregation keep an eye on the congregation as you lead them in worship and take cues from them as needed be prepared to make small changes as needed during the service to get things in sync with the rest of the church 6 x research source if people seem bored or confused they may not know the song or feel comfortable singing it you can encourage them to sing by making a statement like let s worship god together but avoid guilt tripping them with statements like i don t hear anyone singing with me it s also possible that a technical error prevented words from displaying correctly on the screen so glance behind your shoulder to make sure that things are on track worship like you mean it the easiest way to worship like you mean it is to actually mean it focus on the words you sing and speak as you lead if you re only going through the motions without being sincere people are bound to notice while you don t need to act out each song try to use body language and verbal language that matches the tone of the songs you sing smile and move around when you sing joyful songs be more subdued during serious or reflective songs your movements do not and should not be theatrical but the right movements can emphasize the importance of what you re saying more effectively trim the fat keep people actively involved during worship lengthy instrumental solos and content of that nature are an open invitation for people to let their minds drift these things may sound pleasing to your own ear but they if they aren t practical you should leave them out you don t need to cut out all the instrumental parts but ask yourself which are really necessary and which aren t when an interlude provides a helpful transition keep it when the arrangement breaks up the flow of community worship discard or shorten it pray and recite scripture as noted before the verses you read should be picked out and memorized beforehand the prayers can be written beforehand as well or you can ad lib them if you believe that doing so will make them more sincere as with the songs and the readings your prayers also need to connect to the message or lesson being conveyed pay attention to other leaders when it s time for the pastor to deliver his sermon or for someone else to speak give that person your undivided attention you re a leader in the church whether you re on or off so your actions will be noticed by the rest of the congregation even when you aren t singing or speaking be real while you need to set aside your personal feelings to some extent you shouldn t push yourself to make a show of worship if doing so doesn t come naturally to you on days when you feel more subdued allow your worship to be more subdued on days you feel energized let it show a little bit of honesty can go a long way but again make sure that you do not spend time focusing on yourself as you lead others in worship instead of saying i m having a really bad day point out that there are times in life when praise can be difficult but state that it s important to continue worshiping during those times nonetheless pray some more prayer is vital throughout all parts of this process thank god for the worship session after it passes even when things did not go the way you would ve liked ask god for guidance as you reflect on the service and plan for next time take notes shortly after the service ends write a few notes for yourself about what did and did not work use these notes to as you plan for future worship sessions a few things you might need to work on may include diction volume and pitch you may not know how you ll sound in the sanctuary until you actually lead worship there once or twice make adjustments to the way you speak as needed to compensate for things like echo and poor acoustics if others critique you or make suggestions listen to them humbly and with an open mind 7 x research source some of the advice others give may not be practical but some of it will be make sure that you re able to honestly distinguish the difference between helpful criticism and destructive criticism without letting your ego get in the way let go of past mistakes learning from your mistakes and mishaps is great dwelling on those problems and allowing them to negatively taint your thinking is not so great think about ways to correct mistakes of the past and let go of those errors as soon as you make plans to avoid them flaws and mistakes often serve as helpful reminders to keep yourself humble those imperfections can also remind the people you re leading that all of us are only human if you accept your own faults gracefully you can encourage those watching you to do the same,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to conduct a prayer meeting,thinking of hosting a prayer meeting but not sure how to organize it prayer meetings are a way for people to get together and engage in prayer as a group with a little preparation and by following a few steps you can conduct a meaningful meeting full of prayer,choose a suitable time remember that people are quite busy and may not be able to make certain times for a prayer meeting for example it may be difficult to get people to come to an early morning or friday night meeting try choosing a time that is convenient for people such as a sunday afternoon or weekday evening think about choosing a time when there is usually a mass scheduled that way it s a time that would normally be convenient for people a prayer meeting usually lasts about an hour although you can adjust the time if desired get the church leadership involved even if you want to host a prayer meeting outside of church you should keep the pastor involved while others can lead the prayer meeting it is important to keep the church leadership involved so that people respect the legitimacy of the prayer meeting choose a venue usually prayer meetings will be held in a prayer room or other room at the church you can also host small prayer meetings in other locations such as homes if you choose whatever the location make sure it is ready to host the meeting and is a clean space for hosting prayers announce the meeting to all members of the congregation announce the meeting to the members of the congregation make an announcement at mass or send out letters and emails try to get as many people involved as you can to strengthen your prayers speak to individuals to encourage them to come to meetings sometimes people are hesitant to join or try something new speak to people individually and encourage them to come to the meetings sometimes people need just a little push to join in decide on the format you may keep the entire group together for prayers if you are a big group you can also split into smaller groups for prayer other options include asking specific individuals to pray for specific issues or asking two or three people to pray for a specific issue and then asking another two or three people to pray for a different issue you can also do a combination of formats such as beginning with everyone praying together and then allowing people to pray for personal issues in smaller groups plan prayers in advance planning will determine the difference between a vibrant effective prayer meeting and a dull ineffective one people need guidance categories for prayer models for prayer and boundaries for prayer you need to keep people s interest by planning the prayers in advance 1 x research source choose the issues to pray for choose specific issues to pray for during the meeting these issues should be relevant to the people praying and have a clear objective this is important so that people maintain their motivation for coming together for prayer 2 x research source consider beginning with a 1 5 minute period of silence beginning with a short period of silence can help people connect to god through themselves encourage people to completely focus on god during this time alternatively you can sing two or three worship songs before prayer begins give brief instructions about prayer it can help to give a few instructions about prayer before beginning the prayers people need guidance and direction in order to feel comfortable during the meeting this way they will also be more open and willing to participate actively have a short discussion about prayers and requests sometimes it is nice to allow people to request certain prayers or topics to pray for however be careful that this discussion does not take more than five minutes it is very easy for a prayer meeting to turn into a discussion about prayer rather than a time for actual prayers 3 x research source read a short passage from the bible this is not required but can help get people into a spiritual mode make sure this passage is short it should be about 5 minutes long and definitely no longer than 10 minutes pray the point of a prayer meeting is to pray if you let people speak about their own personal prayers or read verses for a long time then it is no longer a prayer meeting make sure you keep the focus on prayer throughout the meeting 4 x research source use variety make prayer meetings different from one another and use different prayers within the prayer meeting try different forms for the meetings such as singing prayers changing between small and large groups being led in prayer praying through confessions and taking prayer requests allow people to pray for short periods allow people to pray when they feel they want to rather than going around the circle and having everybody pray going around the circle is time consuming and people end up composing their prayers as the circle gets closer to them rather than fully joining the prayers pray for one topic at a time choose an issue and stick to it for a time until you are finished praying for that topic only once you have finished praying for that issue should you move to another keep prayers focused on one topic to keep the people focused and thus make those prayers strong keep things moving praying for an hour can seem difficult but if you break it up into shorter prayers including silent prayer led prayer read prayer large group prayer and small group prayer then you have broken it into smaller pieces keep the prayers moving and over time an hour of prayers will no longer seem like a long time on the other hand don t be afraid of silence give people a time to let the prayers sink in and connect with their hearts end the prayer meeting in a way that gives it structure and closure one good way to end the meeting is with a bible reading relevant to the meeting topic be patient praying out loud is difficult for some people and praying for 30 60 minutes can feel awkward at first it takes practice keep working at your prayers and the group will grow together and become stronger 5 x research source allow for spontaneity you want people to feel comfortable praying so the meeting should be flexible and intentional create an open environment for those who attend the meeting so that they can pray with their whole hearts and minds this will also help to get everyone to participate 6 x research source include children if appropriate even though children may have shorter attention spans they can be easily included in prayer meetings oftentimes children

how to appreciate speaking in tongues,when someone receives the holy spirit and with the sign of speaking in tongues they then have a spiritual or prayer language and there is a reason for it it has a purpose a use and is an incredibly useful tool the bible gives a lot of information about its many uses,realize that speaking in tongues was promised by jesus and was to accompany belief and these signs will accompany those who believe in my name they will speak in new tongues mark 16 17 realize that it is the holy spirit who gives the words that you speak and not you yourself and they were all filled with the holy spirit and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance acts 2 4 understand that when you speak in tongues you are talking to god even though occasionally it may be understood by someone as a human language as it was at pentecost its principle purpose is for talking to god for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries 1 corinthians 14 2 use speaking in tongues to edify yourself or build yourself up spiritually this is not a selfish thing but rather the purpose is that when you are built up in your spirit then you can build up or encourage others he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church 1 corinthians 14 4 don t expect to understand what you are saying you have control over the volume and the speed at which you speak but not the content for example as prayer language for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful 1 corinthians14 14 when in private use speaking in tongues as much as you can paul appreciated the benefit of speaking in tongues that s why he said i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all 1 corinthians 14 18 when in public it is much better to speak in the language of the region in order to benefit those you are speaking to yet in the church i would rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue 1 corinthians 14 19

you speak in tongues you re not saying anything bad about god or our lord jesus christ wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost 1 corinthians 12 3 for then will i turn to the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the lord to serve him with one consent zephaniah 3 9 understand that speaking in tongues is defined as praying in the spirit we should pray both in the spirit tongues and in the understanding your natural language 1 corinthians 14 14 15 pray in the spirit tongues to build yourself up in your faith jude 20 understand that speaking in tongues was prophesied by isaiah in the old testament as a sign to the jews isaiah 28 11 1

times and on every occasion stay alert and be persistent in your prayers for all believers everywhere ephesians 6 18 understand what it means when the bible says wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not 1corinthians14 22 this is not a contradiction to when jesus said believers would speak in tongues as a sign think about what a sign is your hometown may have a sign at the entry saying welcome to my town and also local street signs to help you find your way around this is very helpful for a first time visitor but if you live there then you no longer need the sign because you know that you live there and know your way around however the signs remain and you wouldn t want to take them down this is similar to speaking in tongues once you know you have it it is no longer a sign but for someone about to enter in it is a sign remember that when using speaking in tongues or even talking about it you should be aiming to edify others and that it must be done in the context of love 1 corinthians 14 26 1 corinthians 13 1 understand that there is a procedure for speaking in tongues in a church meeting don t all speak in tongues at once but instead only up to 3 people can use speaking in tongues in any meeting and each one should then operate the manifestation of interpretation of tongues given to us by god everything should be done decently and in order with courtesy for example and tongues should not be forbidden from meetings 1 corinthians 14 23 27 and 39 40,Philosophy-and-Religion

universe and the sounds of nature are his creations and proclaim his majesty see isaiah 55 12 psalm 8 god made the world good and mankind very good even though sin has tainted everything the bible states that it is better to listen than to talk james 1 19 20 this means that it is better to be quiet listen and agree with what god s word the bible and spirit has to say rather than talking to him without listening or meditating on the words of god although it is better to listen sometimes you need to get your own thoughts out of the way first god wants to hear from you too you need an equal amount of talking and listening to have a good conversation listening or singing worship songs or hymns is a great way to begin to settle your soul and to concentrate on what god has to say avoid distractions if you can t get away from your work place business or school that s okay you can still try to avoid being distracted from communing even if for only a few moments minutes at a time on a break for instance don t worry about anything instead pray about everything always tell god what you need and thank him for all he has done is doing and will do for his continued blessings on you philippians 4 6 centre yourself meditate be quiet and open your heart begin to acknowledge anything that god could use and want him to waken the spirit and soul side of you you can embrace reflection and remember things that are deeper than filling your time with stuff to do don t force god to say something he will definitely speak when he sees that you are ready to listen using an app like reimagining the examen is great for concentration meditation on god talking with him and repenting it s great to do before bed as you examine your day and ask yourself and god what you did right what needs changing how you handled relationships etc repent of anything that keeps you from finding god whether you feel you aren t centred or maybe you reject truth or don t believe ask him to help and free you from things that distance you from experiencing this if you have done something that you want god s forgiveness for then start with it asking him to forgive you for those minor or major wrongdoings walk in faith and choose to embrace his command he is a rewarder to those who diligently seek him do whatever you think he is saying and continue to walk with faith filled with desire to know him god will not tell you something bad to do but without faith it s impossible to please god so know that he loves you you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free he is the author and finisher of your faith that grows with each small step you take to pursue him read your bible open your bible to favorite passage and read it if you don t have a favorite passage let the bible open to whatever page it lands on and read that scripture the gospels matthew mark luke and john are great places to start as well as the psalms in the old testament see whether god responds to your questions god talks to his creation through his word and signs as the one who can do infinitely more than all we can ask or imagine according to the power that is working among us ephesians 3 20 write down your prayers if that helps you to concentrate write down what god is telling you as well listen to traditional spiritual gospel or contemporary christian music such as hymns or even gregorian chants byzantium chants etc for inspiration and spirituality let god speak to you through christian songs and music see whether you can hear god s holy spirit sending you messages through such songs

better you will feel in your heart jesus calls us his friends remember god s love is perfect and perfect love casts out all fear try not to involve or force others into believing you or your communications with god keep it with you if god wants you to share his word he will tell you be brave when he commands you to walk on his defined path when moses was commanded to free gods people he was scared and raised doubts to god try to believe in god and have faith that he knows what worries you and he will help you if you believe that he knows your concerns practice good manners while communicating respond like a friend and not ignorantly assuming god to know who you are or how you feel inside jesus said you are my friends if you do what i command you i no longer call you servants

a saint nobody s perfect and just acknowledging that you re not is one of the easiest ways to grow your relationship with faith and your belief in the god you come to if you re not sure what you re supposed to say or how you re supposed to act that s fine talking to god doesn t require you to become someone you re not at least at first if you ve never prayed before or weren t raised with any kind of understanding of a god check out this article to get started with some of the basics pray in a way that feels most natural to you some people pray by fully prostrating themselves on the ground and bowing some people pray by closing their eyes clasping their hands and bowing their heads some people chant some people just sit quietly and introspectively there s no one correct way to pray try to find a quiet space somewhere you ll be able to really focus on your faith and what you re trying to say close the door take a few deep breaths light a candle and sit quietly for a few minutes it s not better to pray loudly or to adopt practices you see others engaging in that doesn t mean someone is closer to god than you are it s important to develop a personal relationship not one based on observations of others open up to god what do you say to god largely that will depend on your unique condition and circumstance what do you want to say to god what needs to be heard sometimes it can be hard to know exactly how to get started but focusing on open ended questions both about concerns and devotional joys is common way of praying ask questions that focus on your struggles personally and spiritually your joys personally and spiritually your family their trials and their successes injustice and suffering in the world at large confess sins and ask for forgiveness one of the most

person and to bring yourself closer with god be honest and forthright with your assessment of yourself what do you feel guilty for doing in the past week what do you want to change about yourself how can you lead a better life listen as you speak prayer is a funny thing the way that god chooses to answer prayers varies from person to person from theologian to theologian whatever you believe though and however you choose to pray part of getting closer to god is in learning how to listen and what to listen to look for signs to interpret pay attention to things that seem heavy with meaning many people believe chance encounters are anything but did you get a phone call from an unexpected source take random things as a sign listen to your intuition what your gut tells you is important many people believe that voice inside yourself isn t necessarily your s in the first place but is influenced by the god in whom you trust what do you instincts tell you trust them as you trust god be willing to work for an answer answers to prayers won t come as shouts they ll come as whispers five minutes after praying about unemployment it s unlikely that a knock will come at the door offering you a new job hit the bricks scan the classifieds and do the work of finding your answer have a conversation don t make demands prayer isn t about calling up to the heavens and asking that it rain cash money if you go into prayer expecting the clouds to part and a briefcase full of tens to come down on a lightning bolt you ll be disappointed that s not how prayer works and whether or not you re close to god will have nothing to do with it think of prayer as a conversation with a trusted friend and advisor someone who cares for you like nobody else and who has your best interest at heart there may be no answer to your queries but there s an ear that s always there spend time with like minded believers as iron sharpens iron one man sharpens another is how the bible puts it while prayer is essential to whatever religion you practice it s difficult to grow your faith and your relationship with god all by yourself fellowship with other believers is one of the most important ways to build a relationship and to find peace if you want to become a member of a church check out this article for a good introduction if you re not able to connect with people in your area check out online venues and message boards for members of the religion you re a part of this can be a great way to connect if you re feeling isolated from other believers spend time studying the central religious texts whatever religion you re a part of it s important to head to the source and study the big books at the center of it instead of relying on the words of preachers and supplementary books most religions believe the central texts the bible the quran the mahabharata the torah and countless other texts are all divinely inspired if not the actual words of god reading them is a great way to get closer try organizing your own prayer group or a religious book club these can be great ways to get together and get closer to god as a group as well as struggle through what can be difficult reading together ask big questions growing your faith in god requires that you relentlessly explore the intricacies of your faith and your relationship to your belief system don t shy away from the big questions in your prayer practice try to embrace the questions that might scare you or keep you up at night to move yourself closer to god consider things like why are we here is this a good life that i m leading what is my purpose what can i do for god what happens when i die why does suffering exist confront your doubts doubt is a part of faith just as death is a part of life you re going to confront it and the way you choose to confront it has the potential of bringing you even closer to god it s important to anticipate doubts about your faith and learn to deal with them talk to others when you have doubts many believers fear being outed as doubters when they should take the opportunity to have deep discussions about matters of faith with other believers look at doubt as an opportunity to deepen your faith always pray about your doubts take your concerns and your worries to the source even just talking to god can help some people assuage their doubts keep your mind open for many believers a growing relationship with god can come with a literally holier than thou attitude believing that yours is the one true god and that your relationship is great can make it hard to deal with non believers in a more simplified way as you become more and more confident that your relationship with god is deep it s important to learn how to discuss your faith with others and keep an open mind keeping an open mind doesn t mean opening yourself up to doubts necessarily just that you don t need to condescend to others when matters of faith are at stake go on a spiritual retreat sometimes getting away from the hustle of your daily life and devoting some time to reflection and contemplation is an excellent way to get closer to god lots of religions make retreats or pilgrimages a formalized ritual but there is also an opportunity to do one yourself just to grow your relationship personally try visiting holy places or spending a week at a monastery or at a nature retreat to pull away from your responsibilities for a break from the concerns of the mortal coil retreats can cost big money but they don t have to break the bank with a little creativity worship in your own way on a camping trip or by just taking a long weekend to read quietly and pray if you re a hunter you can get closer to god while you re sitting in a blind at 5 am watching the stars hide don t try to be perfect for one thing perfection is an impossibility it s important to recognize your imperfections and your shortcomings people who are close to religion believe that god is all knowing meaning that god recognizes your shortcomings as well there s no sense in becoming someone that you re not there is no lying in prayer at the same time it s important to recognize the things that you re able to change about yourself and try to work on them self improvement doesn t require you to be perfect but it does require honesty and diligence keep a list of things you d like to work on spiritually and just in your general life how do you want to live what do you struggle with what would make you a stronger believer establish clear goals let god affect your actions it s not enough to be close to god when you re at church and become someone else when you re in public when you take action let those actions be influenced by your spirituality would one course of action serve your relationship with god better than another is your behavior at work in line with the religious text you believe in your personal relationships keep all things pointing back to god you don t have to prove this to anyone but yourself and to god acting extremely pious by connecting even the most basic actions to your god might just come across as fake you don t have to dedicate every bowl of cereal to the glory of the creator to be close with god let god influence your decisions what choices in your life will give you the biggest opportunity to grow spiritually to live happily and to live well the best way to approach these questions is to hand the reigns over to the god that you believe in imagine god were making your decisions for you avoid material worship like the secular world some religions come with lots of trappings bringing yourself closer to god doesn t necessarily involve having more statues crucifixes or prayer candles than your neighbor it has to do with the personal spiritual journey that you re on judaism christianity and many other religions practice some form of tithing or donating a certain sum of money often 10 of your income to the church to which they belong 2 x research source while tithing is celebrated by some as good practice it is derided by others or at least complicated 3 x research source spending more doesn t make you a better servant to god though it helps to give back to the church which helps to spread the ability of others to worship which brings you closer to god in turn there are lots of ways to look at the issue so it s important to pray on it yourself and make your own decision consider taking the next step in many religions the closest one may become to god is to devote your life to monasticism priesthood or ministry while this is a big step that may involve leaving your family and your way of life behind this in itself is a major rite of passage to the most devoted believers explore the options your religion has to offer if you re interested visit a monastery or talk with a church leader at the church you attend express your interest and try to find out what it takes if you aren t able to devote yourself to god full time there are still many ways to volunteer what free time you have to service mission trips leading youth groups and forming prayer groups are all common ways of bringing yourself closer to god and donating your time,Philosophy-and-Religion

feeling upset or stressed out try praying about the problem often just turning to god will help you feel reassured 8 x research source in the bible this is described in philippians 4 7 as the peace of

has a message for you hidden in the lesson anyway read the holy texts for your faith to get inspired most religions have some sort of holy book that describes their take on god when you read your religion s holy text you may find that the words help you find insight and guidance into your own life which may help you feel closer to god 9 x research source for example if you follow christianity

verse let it speak to your heart this may be god sending you personalized instruction or comfort meditate to feel closer to god while traditional meditation focuses mostly on clearing your mind spiritual meditation involves filling your mind with the contemplation of god one way to do this is to focus on a passage from god s word reading it over and over while trying to apply the meaning to your own life 10 x research source each day spend about 5 10 minutes where you sit quietly and reflect on god s love the blessings in your life or even the way his beauty is reflected in

household may not result in many problems assess how independent you are from your family do you have a really close family do your parents want you to pursue a specific education career and eventual marriage you should assess how easy or difficult it will be to marry someone of a different religion knowing how close you are to your family you can claim you ll become more independent and that you ll not care what they think but it s a lot easier said than done 2 x trustworthy source edis electronic database of the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences s peer

be a reaction you ll be unable to ignore prepare yourself for possible negative reactions and outcomes before you talk to your family so there are no surprises if you re not sure how your family will react you might want to feel them out before you tell them about your fiancé in order to do this you may need to subtly bring up similar topics in conversation to see how they react and what opinions they have use this feedback to determine the best possible way to break the news to your family determine if you can live with the possible negative social reactions unfortunately couples of differing cultures races or religions may receive stronger reactions from society than couples who share the same culture race or religion not everyone is strong enough to stand up to this potential criticism especially if it happens on a continuous basis 3 x trustworthy source edis electronic database of the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences s peer reviewed articles go to source ask yourself if you can work you way through this negative social reaction discuss with your partner how you would handle situations like this specifically those that happen in public do you both share the same view on how the situation should be handled look into specific arrangements that may need to be made within your religion depending on which two religions are coming together in marriage there may be certain limitations in one or both of those religions for example if one partner is catholic and the other partner is not christian the marriage may be considered valid in the eyes of the catholic church but it might not be considered a sacrament 4 x research source once you determine what these limitations are you need to evaluate if they bother you and if you can live with the consequences of those limitations confirm you re attracted to your partner attraction is the first step in the three step process that helps us find a suitable long term partner if you are attracted to someone it essentially means that moving to the second step is not only likely but reasonable if you are truly not attracted to this person you need to re evaluate whether it is even worth continuing the relationship regardless of religion 5 x trustworthy source edis electronic database of the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences s peer reviewed articles go to source compare values and beliefs with your partner the second step in the process is getting to know each other s values and beliefs and determining if a difference in values and

sciences s peer reviewed articles go to source comparing values and beliefs can be done both explicitly and implicitly implicitly you can pay attention to the things your partner says and does on a

of your values and beliefs you can start by talking about how your individual religions view certain things and then progress to personal values and beliefs that might not be related to your religion analyze future relationship roles the third step in the process is to evaluate how various roles and responsibilities will be distributed within the relationship if roles and responsibilities are divided based on values and beliefs you need to determine if those divisions make sense to both of you and are something you can agree on 7 x trustworthy source edis electronic database of the university of florida institute of food and agricultural sciences s peer reviewed articles go to source this step normally happens subconsciously couples don t normally sit down and discuss this stuff in an analytical manner if you re coming from a different religion than your partner you might want to consider having an actual serious conversation about these details the outcome of that discussion could make or break your relationship discuss if one partner will be willing to convert to the other partner s religion if one partner is willing to convert to the other partner s religion many problems may be easily solved as there won t be two sets of traditions and beliefs to be followed review whether this conversion is happening because the one partner wants it to happen or because there s too much pressure on them from outside parties e g religious leaders family members etc 8 x research source it is very important that you and your partner do not convert because of too much pressure from the other person converting from one religion to another is an extraordinarily big step and should not be taken lightly decide where the marriage ceremony will be conducted does the religion of one partner require that the marriage ceremony takes place in a specific location or does the fact that it s an interfaith marriage limit the locations where the ceremony can be performed is the ceremony itself going to be a religious event are both religions to be celebrated at the marriage ceremony or do you need to conduct two marriage ceremonies 9 x research source if you want to hold your marriage ceremony in a specific location or include a specific item determine if you need to obtain permission from religious leaders to do this if the marriage ceremony is to include one or more religious event will there be any restrictions on the religious leader who can lead that event for example some religions forbid their religious leaders from performing a marriage ceremony for an interfaith couple determine which religion will be followed on a regular basis do you plan to follow both religions regularly or is the religion of one partner more important to them than religion is to the other partner regardless of which religions are to be followed are they going to be followed by both partners or just the one who is a part of the religion to make your long term relationship truly last these are the types of things you need to figure out in advance 10 x research source think about how you will raise any children you have will your children follow one of the religions or both will you allow them to eventually choose a religion they prefer when they re old enough or will you have them participate in religion events from the time they re born for example if one partner is catholic will your children be baptized as babies or will you let your children decide which religion they prefer when they grow up 11 x research source maintaining an interfaith relationship when there are only two people involved is difficult but is a lot easier than maintaining an interfaith relationship that involves children some religions require that the partner who follows that religion do everything in their power to promise to raise children as part of their faith develop a we partnership rather than viewing yourself as two people from different religions adjust your view to be of a loving couple with similar goals and values focus on your friendship working together to make things work and committing yourself to each other find or create common ground on which you can both

people if they persist you can say my friendship with a jewish person is not your concern i will continue to do what i believe is right remind your family that friendship is not forbidden you might have parents siblings or other family members who disapprove of your friendship perhaps this disapproval is based on political beliefs some might believe that such a friendship is forbidden explain to your family that the quran does not forbid friendships with people of other faiths if your family s disapproval comes from their disdain for israeli politics you can say my friend is not responsible

how to make an atheist and theist relationship work,in many ways an atheist and theist couple has the same needs as anyone in a relationship mutual respect honest communication and a willingness to work through problems if faith or lack of faith is a core part of your identity however you may have trouble with the wide gap between you remember that a successful relationship does not mean total agreement build a bridge of understanding across that gap and you can meet without having to abandon your worldview,keep communication open if your difference in perspective causes friction between you don t let it bubble away silently as with any tension in a relationship it s unlikely to disappear if you don t address it openly once in a while something you say will upset your partner or vice versa talk to each other so you both understand why it was upsetting and what the intent was behind the words communication doesn t mean a shouting match in fact that can be a sign that something has gone unsaid for too long pick the right time to have these conversations when you re both relaxed listen before you jump to conclusions most people have preconceived notions about what people of certain faiths or no faith are like don t assume your understanding of your partner s perspective is true when discussing this sensitive topic let your partner explain their point fully before you leap to respond respect your partner s wishes respect is the most important factor in the success of your relationship neither of you should pressure the other to convert or to leave the faith discuss the topic only if your partner is interested in listening if this is a dealbreaker on some level be honest for example if you can t see yourself marrying someone who doesn t share your faith a serious romantic partner deserves to know that stop trying to prove yourself right you can win an argument but you can t win a relationship in the end what matters is that you are willing to love someone in spite of your differences you do not have to agree with your partner s beliefs but you do need enough of an open mind to recognize the value of a different perspective instead of dismissing it if you think of the other person as stupid or silly for disagreeing with you the relationship is not healthy find a comfortable solution to daily life when it comes down to specific religious practices such as attending services or setting up a place of worship in the house respect the other person s decision and find a compromise if need be through respectful conversation student couples may find it easiest to keep clear boundaries around the religious practices for example spending a weekly holy day apart from each other if you live together the religious person should be allowed to worship at home that said religious practices should not take up all the living space or cause major inconvenience in the atheist s life be considerate don t just avoid inconvenience actively work to accommodate your partner and demonstrate that you respect his or her lifestyle if your partner has religious dietary restrictions invite him to restaurants with plenty of valid options if your atheist partner will be attending a religious holiday at your mom s house prep your family with a few do s and don ts about what to say keep the discussions between you religion is a charged topic in many families and communities it s generally best to keep serious conversations about faith between the two of you rather than airing your issues to a wider social group of course this does not apply to professional counseling handle the community most deeply religious people have a circle of friends who are also deeply religious these friends should not determine the path of your relationship but you can t ignore their existence if these friends act intolerant or offensive the two of you should discuss how to change their behavior or else how to minimize the amount of time the atheist has to spend in contact with that group a smaller proportion of atheists are part of atheism centered communities but this can certainly happen in the other direction as well set aside a quiet afternoon together this exercise is designed to allow two people to share their needs and perspectives with each other you ll need a few hours together in a tranquil setting switch off the cell phones and make sure you won t be disturbed you don t have to be a theist and atheist to try this exercise this can help any two people bridge the gap of understanding between them whether that gap is based on philosophical differences or other factors this is a serious exercise and can be seriously liberating if you both approach it willingly that said it can help to approach it with a sense of fun and anticipation you may learn quite a bit about each other and about the potential of your relationship prepare a writing activity with two notebooks speaking gently to your partner suggest that you

writing certainty is about security stability and predictability in your life variety covers new experiences and adventures whether in other countries or daily life love and connection what do you need to hear your partner say to you in order to feel loved by them what do you need to see them do how can your partner show their love for you in a way that would satisfy this need significance

traits growth could mean improving a particular skill learning new skills or advancing your education or career contribution is about your positive impact on the lives of others whether that means your family your community or the world take a break once you ve each spent a fair amount of time writing on each need take a short break go for a walk have a cup of coffee or simply get up and stretch swap notes with your partner read what they have written to gain a deeper insight into what fulfills them on all levels take your time to absorb this in your own head before you move on to the next step voice your feedback tell your partner what you thought of the exercise and describe your reactions to your partner s notes set a timer for ten minutes when the time is up or you ve run out of things to say set the timer again and let your partner speak alternate back and forth as many times as you would like only one person speaks in each ten minute interval do not interrupt each other think about what you ve learned hopefully you ve developed a greater understanding of your needs as a couple to what extent are these needs reliant on a shared spiritual or religious background you may find that the two of you cannot satisfy or are not prepared to satisfy the majority of each other s needs in this case you may need to discuss possible paths forward to change this or find fulfillment elsewhere on the other hand you may find your partner is keen to understand and meet your needs better even if you do not share the same language of faith,Philosophy-and-Religion

than as being good or bad try to appreciate the little things you may be tempted to think of your life as a series of big events and those events are important but don t forget that your life is also

perspectives if you re upset about something that a friend relative or colleague said did that frustration can quickly ruin an otherwise enjoyable moment it s easy to feel angry with others when you view that person s actions from your own point of view but it s worth considering that his her choice made sense to that individual when you feel yourself becoming upset with another person take a moment to step back force yourself to think of three positive reasons that someone might have said done the thing that upset you focus on positive reasons don t say things like he did it to upset me or he doesn t know what he s doing as you come up with positive reasons work to see the situation from that individual s perspective he or she probably had a rational reason for the behavior at hand which you might be blind to because you re locked in your own perspective learning to see things from other people s perspectives can help you see situations more objectively making you more calm and in the moment it can also help you become a more understanding empathetic individual 13 x research source,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to practice body mindfulness meditation,body mindfulness is one of the forty buddhist meditations it is a meditation designed both for investigation of the body and its nature as well as being a basis for concentration building this meditation is excellent for people who have an anatomical medical or health interest in the body familiarity with the body helps in building concentration on the other hand it s often hardest for people who are the most sensitive towards the body either in regards to its appearance or because they are uneasy with the body s biological processes in spite of this dislike it s recommended that such persons try this style of meditation because they re likely to get the greatest rewards from it of course starting gently and building up experience will help ease newcomers into it here s how to start the meditation and develop it further,select a quiet comfortable place to meditate choose an appropriate time when you feel able to meditate free from distractions select a posture comfortable for you for this meditation all postures are suitable the how to do mindful meditation page describes the four main postures in a little more detail to help you choose one that is practical for you ensure your head and torso are positioned to allow for ease of breathing and awareness having a stiff posture will cause discomfort and a too soft posture will encourage sleepiness relax any tension spend a few moments developing awareness of what you are doing such as sitting breathing and relaxing spending a few minutes this way allows the mind to build more focus and awareness as it examines the body for tension allowing the body to relax also lets your mind become calm and quietened give yourself a few minutes for this to occur and let go of distractions agendas and other subjects of thought mentally divide the body into its component parts start generally with arms legs torso and head as you mentally note the location of each component start to divide it up further to become more aware of smaller details for example the arm may become shoulder upper arm elbow lower arm wrist palm fingers etc spend a minute being both aware of each part but also how they feel such as tense or relaxed hot or cold and so on the purpose is to be aware of not only where they are but what they are how they feel and so on building to a complete body awareness start to mentally note individual parts of the body in more detail there is a typical repetition worth learning that runs along the lines of 1 head hair body hair teeth skin nails 2 muscles sinews bones bone marrow kidneys 3 heart liver stomach spleen lungs 4 bowel intestines feces undigested food brain 5 bile phlegm pus blood sweat body fat 6 tears skin grease snot saliva bone lubricant and urine the traditional order of this list seems unusual but the list divides the body components into two classes solid matter and liquid matter it starts with some of the most easily recognizable external parts head hair skin etc then moves on to more internal parts increasing in complexity as you go what you are doing more or less is a kind of mental ct scan of your body if you have seen scans before you see bones muscles organs etc this is what you are looking for in situ and in action it may or may not appear visually to you like a ct scan but you may feel a sensation or another form of awareness of that body part now spend a moment being aware of each part in turn there is a host of things recommended as a point of study so you may choose any that feel relevant to you at the beginning and then work on to the more complex aspects give each part some time to be studied to gain an understanding familiarity and insight while at the same time direct a calm and relaxed focus towards its nature 1 examine its location in the body how it feels what it is how it is how it came to be what it needs to continue to be etc 2 examine your experiences of how your mind interacts with the body component such as how the heart changes when there is tension in the mind and how the muscles react when there is discomfort 3 examine your experiences of how the body interacts with mental states when there is tension unease fear how does the body feel when there is gradual relaxation in the mind is there gradual relaxation in the body there are many other questions you may ask in this theme 4 is there attachment or any wishes that occur to you in relation to that part of the body the more sensitive practitioner may find the meditation somewhat unnerving and feel squeamish or maybe even think it s gross and weird this method can be used to break down any such squeamishness and other barriers allowing for a tolerance and acceptance to be built on increased understanding of and familiarity with the body 5 consider how fragile the ecosystem of your body is one example is to examine how the blood needs pumping to oxygenate it prevent it from clotting and becoming fatal the blood being pumped helps the immune and healing system and since it helps regulate body temperature we feel cold or hot when the circulation is not free 6 consider how co dependent it is on other aspects of the body and external facts such as food and water air temperature and so on consider how enduring each part is or how much it changes 7 consider how many of the bodily processes and parts run and are maintained on their own independent of us or on autopilot if you will the identity has no involvement in running the liver for example it just works away even when we are deeply asleep if you wish you can spend the entire meditation on just one part or one group however if you wish to do the entire body move on to the next group muscles sinews bones bone marrow kidneys again be aware of each part as above examine the body again and relax any parts that you can should you be aware that they are tense or in an uncomfortable position this meditation essentially works to break down denial fear and squeamishness while building familiarity with as well as awareness and understanding of the body you feed to keep alive by examining its conditional nature as well as its fragility and unavoidable exposure to chances of injury illness pain and organ failure and the inevitability of aging you can learn to accept the body as it is by becoming disenchanted but at the same time compassionate and at peace with the body it s not a shock or distressing should it get injured grow old feel hungry or become ill by using the body as a means of study you can learn to live with the body and its warning signs you will no longer feel unnerved about it generally many people have found this meditation very helpful for directed relaxation pain management increased immune responsiveness and in more rare cases to see which parts of the body are injured or out of alignment you can also focus a compassionate healing energy onto various parts or simply allow the part of the body in question some space to relax and repair itself to aid recovery in some cases instead of fighting it worrying about it and causing other stress related problems this is more advanced for people who have practiced for a long time but it s a very useful tool to develop for those who wish to go further on this subject method let go of any distractions that may arise and keep examining and studying the part your body or continue through the list this is another place where mindfulness and concentration comes in and is excellent to develop the mind to focus to develop this meditation further for deeper concentration start to drop away the repetition of words to develop wordless awareness fix your awareness on the component part of the body that is most evident to you should a particular part simply become visible or more noticeable by feeling or some image focus and develop that awareness letting it become the sole object of your focus and awareness examine it more simply but in whole so if a color arises it is recommended to not pay too much attention on the color but instead to focus on what part of the body the color refers to mastering this does take time and indeed it can take many years before it becomes a powerfully insightful tool beginners should not be concerned if nothing happens at all in regards to increased awareness for some it might just appear on focus for others they might need to look at some strands of head hair collected from a brush and put in the hand you examine those as per kasina meditation until an image arises for some it will never happen as this is not the right type of meditation for them regularly measure against your own experiences how or where this meditation has bought you any benefit it might have been an increase in general concentration or a deeper understanding of the body to allow you to live more happily and healthy the analogy of the lotus applies here too the lotus grows in mud and dirty water but rises above it to stand free mentally we can rise above the aspects of the body that we would otherwise find disgusting stressful or frightening and so stand free from shock or fear,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to be observant,if you ve been known to walk into sliding glass doors nearly hit a pedestrian when you re driving or to stand right behind your best friend in line at the coffee shop for ten minutes without noticing her then you may need to hone those observational skills all you have to do is turn your focus outward slow down and pay more attention to the details you ll be amazed at what you don t know you ve been missing,listen to your gut part of being more observant is being aware of what your body is telling you this can t always be described in a logical fashion it just means listening to your gut do you feel like you ve walked into an awkward situation but you don t know why do you suddenly feel danger when you re on your way to your car chances are your instincts are right and you should listen to what you feel internally even if you can t quite explain why many people aren t observant because they ignore anything that they can t clearly see or prove you may have a sense that you are in danger don t ignore it just because you can t see the bad guy become more self aware another part of being observant is being able to know yourself and to be aware of who you are how you act and how you come off this doesn t mean that you should obsess over yourself but it does mean that you should have a sense of the kind of energy you give off do people see you as shy outgoing friendly or mysterious knowing yourself first will help you observe others and have a better sense of what s going on in the world 1 x research source pay more attention to others than yourself this is something that you ll have to do to shift your focus outward a lot of people aren t observant because they re so self conscious that they re busy worrying about how they look or project themselves in every possible interaction if you re always thinking about your own every move then how will you be able to really notice something about your friends teachers or colleagues it s important to be self aware but if you cross the line over to being self obsessed then you ll miss off on many key observations check yourself the next time you talk to a new friend are you worrying about what to say or do next the whole time or are you too busy listening to what the friend has to say to really care about yourself ask yourself questions though you shouldn t ask yourself so many questions that you re not living in the moment you should keep your mind active when you re observing something so you have the best sense of what s going on ask yourself how is this person really feeling what is the difference between what he is saying and what he is really feeling how many people in this room are in a good mood how many people are wearing black keep your mind busy and keep prodding yourself to discover what s really happening in a situation as you practice your observational skills you ll be able to keep questioning the situation while paying complete attention at first switching to this inquisitive mode of thinking can be a little bit distracting put away the distractions the reason that most people aren t observant these days is because of the infinite amount of distractions all around us if you re in a social setting don t play around with your ipod if you re studying for a test put away your magazines put away anything that s keeping you from focusing and noticing whatever is in front of you hide your phone spending all of your time on your cell phone is the easiest way to be completely unobservant to annoy the people around you and to have absolutely no idea what s going on what s more if you re texting while walking riding a bus or generally hanging out in public you ll be much more likely to get your stuff stolen or to walk right in to a dangerous situation because you had absolutely no clue about what was actually happening if you re having a real conversation with a friend put the phone away and stop having a text conversation with a different friend if you really want to observe what s going on then you should just focus on one conversation at a time take the time to really listen being a good listener is different than just being a listener when a person is talking to you pay attention to that person s words emotions body language and gestures to get the full picture don t interrupt the person or just wait for him to stop talking so you can start sharing your own opinions nod when it s necessary make comments when the conversation asks for it but don t say that s so true every two seconds or the person will get distracted 2 x research source if a person is telling you about a problem he or she is experiencing don t jump in and offer advice right away sometimes the person may just want to talk and may just want you to be there to listen pay attention to the details a person reveals about his life so you can refer back to them in the next conversation if you see a casual friend who says he s going up to tahoe to ski for the weekend the next time you see him ask about his big trip use a person s appearance to see how he feels being observant means more than just listening to the words a person says it means checking out how a person looks and acts for insight into how he is really feeling your friend may be telling you that she s getting over her break up just fine but her eyes may be red and puffy your boyfriend may tell you that he s not so stressed out at work but he can come home with his nails bitten down to the quick people may say one thing and feel another so pay attention to their appearance for more insight into what s really happening 3 x research source let s say your boss came in with bags under his eyes on the day you wanted to ask for a raise if he s acting and looking worse than usual then you may want to wait until the next day when he s back to being his usual self being observant here can help you benefit yourself observe a person s mood it s hard to say exactly how to categorize a person s moods but be on the lookout for changes of behavior to see how your friends or acquaintances are really feeling to see if there s a change in a person s mood you have to recognize the norm first if your friend is usually grumpy in the morning then it means nothing if she s grumpy when you see her before school but if she s a morning person and looks groggy and like she hasn t slept then something bad might have happened to her a mood is like an aura that surrounds a person be observant to feel out the vibe you get a person can be upset excited nervous angry bitter confused frustrated elated or disappointed without saying a word about it use all five senses engage all of your five senses when you re in a conversation with someone or even just when you re observing others this is the ultimate way to be fully observant here are some things that you can do use your eyes to observe and scan your surroundings and people s behavior wherever you are use ears to pay attention to all the different voices you should be able to distinguish voices from a lot of noise use touch to know the mood of people for example if someone shakes hands with you and you find the person s hands sweaty then the person may be nervous use your nose to detect any smell that is out of the ordinary like a sudden change in aroma of the area notice what s not being said what a person tells you is just as important as what he or she doesn t say so pay attention for what s absent as well as what s present for example if your friend is always gushing about how amazing her boyfriend is and suddenly he doesn t come up at all in the course of a long conversation then maybe something is up if your mother has been really excited about a big promotion at work and then she comes home and only wants to talk about your schoolwork then maybe things didn t work out often people don t want to mention the disappointments in their lives or the things that they want to keep private be observant to see what s missing in a conversation pay attention to body language body language can be another strong indicator of what a person is really thinking and feeling if a person is standing up straight looking straight ahead or like he s ready for the next big thing then chances are he s in a good mood and ready for success if someone is slouching hunched over fidgeting with his hands or looking at the floor then maybe things didn t go so well for that person today 4 x research source but of course if that s how the person always looks then the body language may not mean as much but if you notice something out of the ordinary then it may indicate a change in mood or emotion notice your surroundings don t just pay attention to people notice how many cars are in the parking lot along with yours notice what kind of birds are flying around the beach that day see which fruits are being sold in the grocery stores and notice whether the prices have gone up or down since the last time keep your eyes and ears open at all times and look for anything out of the ordinary even if you re just walking down the street you can practice noticing your surroundings when you re on your own and then become more aware of your surroundings when you re talking to people take a painting class painting classes will greatly improve your observational skills because you will have to paint whatever you see in front of you whether it s a beautiful landscape or a bowl of fruit you ll have to understand lighting proportion and other key elements that will help you see what is really in front of you and to analyze it as well you don t have to be naturally gifted to take a painting class even if you don t come out a stellar artist your observational skills will reap the benefits 5 x research source spend time observing people from a distance situate yourself in a coffee shop or a park get your latte and watch what people are doing pay attention to body language moods

it you don t have to stare at people and furiously jot things down in a small notepad write in a larger notebook and keep a textbook or novel handy so people think you are taking notes on the reading material take a dance class taking a dance class will improve your powers of observation because you will have to watch how the teacher s body is moving and mimic those movements with your own body

trying to dissolve 1 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 91 but also feeds the egoic mind that s why mind loves it otherwise who would offer futile resistance to life in other words resistance unhappiness or negativity in any form re energizes the reactions and mental patterns and keeps the undesirable situation in place 2 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 189 whenever you are unhappy there is the unconscious belief that the unhappiness buys you what you want if you the mind did not believe that unhappiness works why would you create it a course in miracles when you see this with clarity you naturally become surrendered and yielding as you realize how insane futile and painful it is to stand in inner opposition to what is that s when a greater intelligence is in charge far more intelligent than human mind as yielding or non resistance to what is makes way for the greatest power in the universe read dissolve the ego according to eckhart tolle s teachings for more insight dissolve the ego ego is identification with forms thoughts voice in your head and emotions which makes thinking compulsive and involuntary form identification is in the very structure of ego it doesn t care if the story or content or form it identifies with is good or bad as long as it has something to identify with to ensure its survival and seek itself in them for instance even if you are suffering from anxiety then atleast you have a story that says i have been suffering from crippling anxiety my whole life to get a false sense of self that s why as a pragmatic practice introducing spiritual pointers or practices which are no ordinary words or practices but are charged with spiritual power to replace or merge with incessant thought stream help dissolve the sickness of mind if one is ready for it its cause spiritual pointers or practices can potentially reverse the hypnotic and seductive effect of voice in head or egoic entity and point you to the stillness or formless dimension within it is highly recommended that you read dissolve the ego according to eckhart tolle s teachings for more insight ego was a necessary stage in the evolution of consciousness but now to advance into the next stage and ensure our survival it needs to be dissolved its cause as per the current state of humanity there is a sense of urgency 3 x research source tolle eckhart i a new earth

come into being only through enthusiasm enjoyment and surrender there are many negative things or limit situations by conventional terms that happen in life and of course you cannot enjoy or be

i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 194 to end suffering it s because when you truly surrender you are internally free of the external circumstances and are aligned with the fact of the moment in other words you become one with the now and don t treat it as an enemy or obstacle or means to an end there s no suffering in the now because mind stops when you are completely present as mind is synonymous with time and suffering by suffering we are primarily pointing to psychological suffering don t misinterpret surrender as giving in surrender is purely an inner phenomenon 5 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 218 it means to offer uncompromising acceptance to the flow of life within without any judgments or reservations as if it was your choice what s the flow of life within the thoughts emotions and reactions that arise at this moment in response to anything allow them let them be and let them go in other words be the knowing that is aware and enables the thoughts and emotions to be this doesn t mean you can t take action to bring about a positive change to the situation or condition surrender is perfectly compatible with action 6 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 208 in fact surrendered action is infinitely more powerful as it s in alignment with universal intelligence surrender happens when you no

krishnamurti this is the surrendered state when you relinquish inner resistance to life and become one with what is you only need to be concerned with your inner state and outside will fall into place as world is just a reflection of inner state if you look closely all spiritual practices lead towards surrender whether its breath or inner body awareness watching the mind becoming aware of the now etc as they all imply inner acceptance or alignment with the now use the suffering at this moment as an opportunity to yield when you suffer consciously that is to say when you can t take the pain anymore and relinquish resistance to what is then resistive mental patterns dissolve because non surrender resistance is what strengthens them jesus s saying not my will but thy will be done points to

your mind 9 x research source tolle eckhart i stillness speaks whispers of now i vancouver bc namaste publishing 2003 page 121 you only need to surrender to the tiny segment called the now and not the story or idea of life situation or condition for example even if you are suffering from a terminal illness that illness at this moment could be pain or pressure in body weakness discomfort disability etc however they don t cause suffering its the unhappy thoughts stories labels etc and emotions that come in response to them make you unhappy that is what you surrender to and not the idea or story of illness or life situation to be more precise you allow the suchness of the moment by accepting and allowing the thoughts emotions and reactions that arise in the now in response to anything its because mind is synonymous with resistance and causes suffering while acceptance withdraws energy from mind if you can t surrender as your pain could be deep then bring surrender to your non surrender accept that you cannot accept for example suppose you cannot accept that you have a serious illness that is to say you are resisting the idea or label or story or suchness of illness in form of sorrow anger resentment self pity etc which are ultimately thoughts and emotions in that case allow or accept the resistive thoughts and emotions that arise in the now in response to the illness in other words accept the thoughts and emotions that are arising in the now that say something like i cannot accept this illness life has treated me harshly this cannot be happening etc the moment you completely accept your non peace your non peace transforms into peace anything you accept fully will take you into peace this is the miracle of surrender eckhart tolle if surrender is not possible

there is no escape from the now why not welcome it become friendly with it or atleast accept it regardless of the form of the present doesn t matter how bad it looks like some illness disastrous or undesirable life situation torturous job etc can you single out this moment and ask yourself what is the problem now you are reading this now when you make the now the primary focus of your life you

them because they strengthen its illusory sense of self which is soon coming to an end whether it s 1 5 15 or 50 years it s soon all of your problems life situations and drama would be denoted as a

life then everything around you becomes friendly because you are in inner alignment with it in other words you don t demand that experiences circumstances or people should fulfill you or make you happy its the mind that isolate things and events label them as good or bad or even neutral etc however seen from higher perspective things and events are part of the higher good that has no opposite when you are in inner alignment with what happens outer dependency on forms and events dissolves that s when things desires fear conditions etc loose their seriousness and power over you as you are in your own power if action or words are needed they come through the core of your being as tao te ching puts it as intuitive responses and not from limited conditioned mind this action is truly intelligent as it is in alignment with the totality of the universe for example if you have a job that you don t prefer you might find yourself walking out of there or in a state of acceptance either way you will be at peace read know your true self for more depth realize that ego is very clever and short sighted the more you practice inner acceptance or being present more thoughts and emotions will come as if they are a priority and must be dealt with immediately that is to say ego will do all it can to make you lose the now because present moment is its death so its essential to be rooted within inner body or mind will take you over like a wild river again mind has this delusion that dwelling on time psychological suffering or resisting the pain will somehow dissolve it however more it

mind in addition to ego mental noise is familiar despite how dysfunctional it is which is one of the primary reasons why ego dislikes or ignores the present moment because it adheres to the known mental noise while unknown present moment to ego is dangerous or death that s why it is often seen people stuck in dysfunctional relationships with no apparent intention of getting out or accepting it

why mind continuously seeks one thing or experience or relationship after another and covers up the now with compulsive repetitive and useless thinking to ensure its survival awareness helps to dis identify with your thoughts and see the truth that most of your thinking is automatic compulsive repetitive pointless resists what is and primary cause of suffering when you see this you naturally become non reactive surrendered and allow whatever arises to come and go because it is as it is mind s impersonal and dysfunctional nature is recognized yielding and disidentifying from your thoughts becomes a constant practice that s how you heal the sickness of mind identification without any effort or making it into an enemy meditation means recognizing the false as false this must go on all the time nisargadatta maharaj see that thoughts come in your absence the moment you are not present thoughts mind and world will take you over so an intense alertness is needed to be there as the silent witness as a practice when you catch yourself lost in thinking especially repetitive negative and compulsive thoughts and unverbalized reactions ask questions like who s talking here me or the mind am i these thoughts emotions and reactions etc then become still take a few conscious breaths and or feel your intelligent inner body however don t ask the mind false self or it will most likely say of course it s you who s talking or think about your problems they are more important or may be later you can be present that later will never come this is the dysfunction i e identification with

that clouds awareness through resistance and compulsive thinking then one day you may realize that you have a choice to not follow or identify with conditioned thoughts that is to say power to choose peace rather than drama until then as long as you are your mind you have no choice watching doesn t mean to judge or analyze or react but impartially listen or watch the voice in head else it would be the same voice that came through the back door non verbal mental or physical reactions are also aspects of voice in head or egoic mind so an intense alertness is needed to detect them alternatively when you find yourself lost in compulsive thinking simply shift your attention to inner body or other present moment anchors as this practice withdraws energy from mind also being rooted in inner body is essential to be the witness of your thoughts and emotions we have talked about this already if that s not possible take action immediately or remove yourself from the situation 18 x research source

it feel it fully what could be more normal that you don t want to feel what you are feeling however sooner or later you will realize that there is no escape the only way is through when you go deeper into your pain or feel it fully you will notice that its no more than tautness tension strain accumulation of energy pressure in head and or body etc and they don t make you unhappy its the negative thoughts and reactions in response to them make you unhappy and feed the mind we spoke about this earlier that s when surrender happens automatically because full attention is full acceptance is

inner body at the same time you can also verbalize as it s seen in therapy or inquire into your present psychological state as it helps bring unobserved mental patterns and reactions in the light of consciousness or presence however deeply realize that your presence or awareness is primary agent for inner transformation and dissolves the past else exploring your past may become a bottomless pit there s always more stories read stay rooted in being for more depth again more or better thinking and analysis cannot dissolve the dysfunction of mind because thinking is limited also be alert that pointers in the article like going deeper into your pain watching the mind inner acceptance to what is etc may become mental concepts as you will read in the last step just watch and allow the resistance here are a few examples of resistive thoughts and patterns why this suffering would not go away i or my child should not have to suffer why am i getting these thoughts or emotions why am i resisting why was i not conscious enough before i am was not deeply in the now i should be free of ego by now this should not be happening etc these are futile conditioned or egoic reactions and mind s strategies that not only re energize the mind but also make you suffer so much more than the actual situation or condition in other words these thoughts or reactions even if they sound spiritual not only feed the ego but seem to offer justification for your unhappiness but in reality cause it plus negative energy associated with these thoughts and emotions keeps the undesirable mental patterns and situation in place this is the dreadful dysfunction that most of humanity is suffering from to a varying degrees i e resisting what is and seeking answers and self in mind and the world even though it lies at the root of suffering the greatest difficulty is the mental resistance to things that arise and the underlying assumption is that they should not eckhart tolle again acknowledging and accepting the resistive thoughts emotions and reactions is even more important than watching the incessant thinking and external stimuli resistance can be in form of any negative state such as anger resentment frustration fear urge to argue grievance sadness being fed up etc also many subtle forms of resistance such as boredom irritation nervousness unease etc are so common that we don t recognize them as suffering 20 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 73 just like you cannot fight the darkness you cannot fight unconsciousness or ego bringing the unobserved mind or ego in the light of your presence is enough as when you are simply watching or are aware or allow what is to be a different dimension of consciousness is activated 21 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 56 135 210 that

emotions that has caused unimaginable suffering on yourself and others say an inner yes say an inner yes to the present moment doesn t matter what you say or do externally but there should be an inner yes or an inner alignment to what is as if you have chosen it what does it mean to say inner yes it means say yes to the thoughts reactions and emotions that arise in the now in response to anything situation people or mind by allowing watching accepting or giving them full attention etc however you don t have to follow them as thoughts create a lot of problems too when there is true inner acceptance world and mind lose their power over you you transcend the drama of the world and rest in joy and peace of god compared to that happiness and unhappiness are quite shallow at this state you honor tasks appreciate good things and enjoy fleeting experiences of this world but they no longer bind you anymore as there s no attachment now do you see the deeper significance of inner acceptance and watching your thoughts and emotions as when you are watching or allowing the thoughts self talk reactions and emotions to be you are not unconsciously participating identifying or resisting in the world of forms the drama or dream as thoughts are about the world the known you step out of thousands of years of dissolve the ego according to eckhart tolle s teachings psychological time conditioning start with little things give your full and unconditional attention to anything you are doing like brushing your teeth cooking washing your hands walking changing clothes etc for example when you are walking from one place to another feel the energy in your body your feet touching the ground movement of your hands and legs pay attention to each step you are taking flow of your breath etc most people even advanced spiritual practitioners are lost in thoughts while engaged in these chores or simple activities because they have more important things to do and think about however these simple things are significant and great opportunities to anchor to the now and practice the art of being present to deepen presence 22 x research source tolle eckhart i a new earth i vancouver bc penguin 2005 page 266 everybody s life really consists of small things greatness is a mental abstraction and a favorite fantasy of the ego the paradox is that the foundation of greatness is honoring the small things of the present moment instead of pursuing the idea of greatness eckhart tolle eckhart tolle don t let a mad world tell you that success is anything other than a successful present moment give on a universal level giving is the same as receiving the more you give the more you will receive if you feel like you are lacking something in life then ask yourself what can i give in this situation try this for a couple of weeks and see how it changes your reality whatever you think people are withholding from you praise appreciation assistance loving care and so on give it to them you don t have it 23 x research source tolle eckhart i a new earth i vancouver bc penguin 2005 page 191 just act as if you had it and it will come then soon after you start giving you will

even know that you have it this includes abundance source of true power and abundance is within and not without stay rooted in being be aware of your mind and or breath and or awareness and or inner body and or sense perceptions as much as you can whichever practice practices feel easier and natural in the now in other words be present inner body is a bridge between form and formless universal intelligence so keeping some attention within while doing anything keeps you connected with being being is intelligence itself the traditional word for which is god 24 x research source tolle eckhart i a new earth i vancouver bc penguin 2005 page 52 through inner body you are forever one with god it is highly recommended to read stay rooted in being for more depth recognize the interconnection between mind emotions and physical body if you are aware enough you may have noticed physical reactions in body in response to your mental reactions thoughts and emotions 25 x research source tolle eckhart i a new earth i vancouver bc penguin 2005 page 132 like face or brain or heart muscles twitching becoming tense or reacting in response to an undesirable thought or incident as if trying to control willing it to change or suppress etc similarly have you noticed emotional reactions to your fearful or other negative thoughts in body and vice versa like anxiety fear longing incompleteness anger etc negative thoughts can even activate the pain body these emotions actually interfere with the harmonious functions of the body and cause illnesses 26 x research source tolle eckhart i a new earth i vancouver bc penguin 2005 page 45 since physical mental and emotional dimensions are interconnected so becoming aware of physical and or emotional reactions also brings the unconscious or non verbal mental patterns in the light of your consciousness its cause sometimes mental reaction arises so quickly that even before it is voiced by mind the body has already responded in form of emotion and or physical reaction if you single out the moment you may notice that physical reactions and emotions are no more than intense pressure or tension or energy or sensations you feel somewhere in the body for the most part they don t make you unhappy it s the automatic mental emotional resistance in response to them that make you suffer when you shift attention from negative emotions and accumulated psychic or mental patterns psychological time to now and or inner body and or other present moment anchors and or awareness you may notice that they dissolve or atleast their intensity lessens as mental attention or dwelling which is a form of resistance feeds them and keeps them in place while withdrawal of attention from mind to the now dissolves the ego shifting attention to the now also implies accepting what is if acceptance or shifting attention from mind to the present moment anchors is not possible such as when pain body is active then go deeply into the pain emotions mental patterns etc hold it in the loving embrace of your timeless knowing or awareness in other words give full attention to the pain allow it to be or feel it fully but don t think about it as you go deeper into the pain you may notice how awareness transmutes the pain into itself that s also surrender we spoke about this earlier if none of that is possible there are few more pragmatic practices in the article stay rooted in being experiment mental labeling or narration happens automatically on the basis of the conditioning and nature of mind have you noticed when you see some person or experience something there is a small pause and then mind kicks in with the automatic mental labeling or random thoughts 27 x research source tolle eckhart i a new earth i vancouver bc penguin 2005 page 121 try it now look away from the screen and watch your inner self with high alertness did you notice a pause of no thought and then the heavy mind machinery started causing tautness or pressure or tension in your body and brain muscles did it feel as if resisting or judging what is this is mind in its habituated resistive and automatic labeling mode draining you of life energy and putting stress on your body colors blind the eye sounds deafen the ear flavors numb the taste thoughts weaken the mind desires wither the heart tao te ching many people are not even aware of this automatic mental labeling and unhappiness it causes because of excessive mental noise or they consider it normal they cannot separate their thoughts and reactions from the situation or condition it may seem like situation or people are causing the unease or suffering but in reality its the automatic mental emotional interpretation or resistance similarly we automatically judge or label or conceptualize people or a group of people this is the reason why it becomes easier to vilify people because we have already vilified them in our mind by labeling or conceptualizing them to reduce the aliveness of another human being to a concept is already a form of violence eckhart tolle this does not mean you don t see what they do or put up with bad behavior however you see their actions and words as mentally conditioned and not who they truly are you don t awaken spiritually until automatic labeling and habitual naming ceases or atleast you become aware of it eckhart tolle see the suchness of this moment can you refrain from adding mental stories to situation or people or conditions and just see the isness or suchness of the moment she didn t have the decency to return my call

problems for problems and stories unnecessarily complicate the simplicity or suchness of the now and drain you of the energy which could have been used to deal with challenges any story or labels even if people agree with you are no more than concepts or bundle of thoughts in your head you will suffer if you make an identity out of them in other words when you become the thoughts and reactions rather than being the watcher when you don t judge or label the now rational action if required comes from infinitely intelligent unconditioned consciousness we spoke about this earlier smile and laugh when you notice yourself being taken over by mind or any egoic pattern then smile laugh and have fun with it 29 x research source tolle eckhart i the power of now a guide to spiritual enlightenment i vancouver bc namaste publishing 1999 page 84 thoughts and emotions are energy that arises in your space of consciousness since energy can only be transmuted so practices like verbalizing smiling inner body awareness doing something constructive breath awareness watching the mind having fun and primarily no inner resistance to what is help transmute negative low frequency mind energy to high frequency of consciousness read stay rooted in being for pragmatic practices allow remain non reactive and smile even if it makes you indulge in unconscious behavior if guilt arises allow it to be as guilt is one of the most clever ways the ego uses to keep you identified with it when you are stillness what can you resist most of the people don t know who they truly are they are trapped in the dream of forms and see reality through limited view of sense perceptions and conditioned mind unaware that none of that is them 30 x research source tolle eckhart i a new earth i vancouver bc penguin 2005 page 55 however that s the reality of the majority of people i e completely identified and lost in mind and form with fear and desire being inevitable consequences of this illusion they are not even there feeling a deep peace or thinking it s nonsense channel the reactive energy have you ever noticed that before you start running or any other challenging task mind becomes quite active for example conditioned thoughts like this is going to be tough i don t feel like running this is a mistake etc may start arising however when you take action that withdraws or shifts attention away from the initial static of reactive thoughts and emotions to the activity of running constructive action then the static of thoughts begins to fade or disappear if you had believed your mind in the first place would you have run the initial thoughts that arise are what we are conditioned to think this is why instead of offering mental attention or fighting or resisting the conditioned thoughts and reactions which gives them renewed strength simply acknowledge or allow them to be or immediately shift attention from mind to inner body or other present moment anchors or take constructive action in other words become present that s what dissolves the ego without any effort this also implies withdrawing energy from mind in a pragmatic creative and constructive way to allow whatever arises to come and go again identification with compulsive thinking resistance and reactions is only going to keep the mental patterns in place and suffering alive one of the reasons for high thought activity is because of the unreleased surplus energy in body its because mind acts out this surplus energy via compulsive thinking so some form of good physical workout helps release this built up energy which helps reduce mind activity so try different experiments and practices to withdraw attention or energy from mind enter the now from there the time is always now 31 x research

from eternal source that shines away the heavy and unnecessary accumulated psychological baggage of past and future in your psyche this decision you d have to make again and again and again until now becomes the primary focus of your life free yourself from all concepts your mind may ask questions like so how can i allow thoughts and emotions what does it mean to watch your inner self what s enter now from there etc and come up with mental answers on the basis of its conditioning past for example your mental answer could be watching means to just be silent and observe this may trigger another question so how can i observe and this may lead to another mental interpretation until mind conceptualizes it which implies that you are looking for the truth in words form and concepts where it cannot be found if you didn t see concepts or words even if they sound spiritual as conditioned mental interpretations and no more than pointers they will become great obstacle as concepts mental

to observe or accept what is you need to be extremely alert to catch and detect these subtle and preverbalized mental patterns and reactions although it s ok to use these pointers or concepts in the

how to go with the flow,no matter how hard you try to plan ahead life is always going to throw surprises your way whether you are on a business trip working on a school project or trying to enjoy a night out with friends there is always the danger of someone or something interfering and keeping things from going smoothly learning to go with the flow will help you deal with moments when things don t go the way you planned a person who knows how to go with the flow can adapt to any situation and still come out successful,realize that you can t control everything no one can plan for every potential problem that might arise 1 x research source the important thing is that you understand that you have the ability to problem solve in the moment part of this is accepting that problems will arise going with the flow is having the confidence that you ll be able to handle the unexpected a presentation at work that relies heavily on powerpoint might get derailed because the projector breaks down or a file won t open a person planning a party might have a good idea of how many people are going to show up but must also be prepared for that number to be more or less than anticipated and adjust accordingly in the moment a teacher with a well thought out lesson plan must always be ready to answer questions they did not anticipate don t be afraid to ask for help if you find yourself in a situation where you don t know how to proceed for example you might ask if anyone in the meeting knows how to fix the projector or you might see if anyone at the party wouldn t mind running out for more snacks if you find that you are running low see the humor in a situation that has turned out completely different than you expected say you wore a suit to a party where everyone else is dressed much more casually this can be embarrassing but a person who knows how to go with the flow understands that it is also not the end of the world using humor can lighten a stressful situation i m just trying to class this place up i have a movie premier to get to after the party accept that you can t control others going with the flow means sometimes giving up control not only of the situation but of other people a situation might become more stressful because of the behavior of another person perhaps someone is late to a dinner outing and you have to wait for them to arrive before ordering you may be at a party where someone is monopolizing the conversation which is leading you to become frustrated remember that in situations like this you can t control someone else but you can control your own actions 2 x research source try to empathize with the other person why might they be acting the way they are acting give them the benefit of the doubt most people are just trying to do their best to be happy the person might not know that their behavior is being perceived as disruptive practice exposing yourself to the unknown 3 x research source try doing a small unpredictable thing each day walk or drive a new way home from work without planning it ahead of time go to a new place for lunch order something you re not sure you will like start a conversation with someone at school or at work that you don t know very well the more comfortable you get at putting yourself in situations that are unpredictable the more easily you will be able to go with the flow no matter where you are let go of the idea that things need to be perfect 4 x research source things are never going to be perfect we may set up an idea of how we want things to go but rarely do they work out exactly that way striving for perfection is striving for something that does not exist 5 x research source you don t need to completely let go of your goals for a project or outing just be sure to make room for the fact that things don t always happen precisely the way you would like them to focus more on the experience than the outcome whether you are cooking a new meal for the first time or attending a dance class expecting that you ll get it perfect the first time is only going to distract you from the joy of learning how to do something new instead focus on the method and the joy of each moment rather than obsessing about the outcome avoid seeing yourself as a set of accomplishments the things we achieve in life can give us confidence and make us feel good but it becomes dangerous when we lean too much on them for all our happiness think about the other things that give you joy like a sport you play a hobby you have or a friendship or relationship you cherish look at the big picture 6 x research source overall will going along with a change of plans have any long term effects on your happiness putting things into perspective can be a great tool for helping you go with the flow when you find yourself in a situation where a loss of control is becoming stressful take a step back and ask yourself what the actual consequences will be if things don t work out the way you originally wanted them too if you and some friends planned on seeing a movie only to discover it is sold out when you get to the theater what is the harm of agreeing to see something else that you may not be as excited about there is always the possibility that you might like the movie even if you don t think you will and even if you don t you ll still get to hangout with your friends think about what you have to gain by going with the flow being surprised can be one of the best parts of life when you are struggling to go with the flow ask yourself what new things you may learn or experience by letting go of control 7 x research source embracing a last minute change of plans can be rewarding the restaurant you planned to go to is too crowded great this may force you to try a place you would have never gone to otherwise your favorite seat in the lunchroom is taken look at this as an opportunity to sit next to someone you don t know very well and get to know them better maybe your boss gives you an assignment you weren t expecting this is a great opportunity to expand your role at work and to show how adaptable you can be breathe it can be difficult to go with the flow if you are feeling overwhelmed or anxious practicing some deep breathing techniques can help settle your nerves and clear your mind try shifting your focus to your breathing for a few minutes count your breaths up to seven and then back down again do this several times until you start to feel calm again 8 x research source live in the moment dwelling on things you could have or should have done in the past will only make it more difficult for you to enjoy what is actually happening in your present accept that what is happening in this moment is your reality and that beating yourself or spending your time searching for someone to blame is not going to change anything instead focus on what feels good about the moment 9 x research source i m still able to spend time with my family even though the thanksgiving turkey is burned remember that you may not be able to change your surroundings or your situation but you do have control over how you react to them 10 x research source try to focus on the positives 11 x research source if you are stuck brooding over things that have gone wrong try to shift your thinking to focus on the things that have gone right or that you have done well so far 12 x research source maybe your presentation at work didn t go quite the way you expected but you can still focus on the work you ve done for the project overall maybe you taught a class where you feel like the lesson wasn t communicated as efficiently as it could have been remember that you ve also taught other successful classes and that you still have the ability to learn and grow avoid if only statements 13 x research source if you catch yourself saying things like if only i had stayed at home or if only i had planned my night more thoroughly stop yourself immediately this type of thinking will only pull you out of the moment and make you feel worse keep a journal keeping a journal is a really helpful way to keep track of situations where it might be difficult for you to go with the flow write down what it is about those moments when you feel like you need to be in control and what makes those moments so difficult for you you can also write down times when you found going with the flow to be easier than usual what is similar or different about those moments 14 x research source trust that other people s ideas can be as good as yours be open to the idea that someone else can take control of the situation if need be and that they might be able to do just as good a job as you when it comes to leading everyone through something like rain on a wedding day a lost dinner reservation or a boring board game night this will not only help you feel like you can more easily go with the flow it will take some of the pressure off of you 15 x research source don t make yourself responsible for every decision that needs to be made let someone else choose where to go dancing on saturday night and be okay with whatever comes of it if you are working on a group project be sure to get input from everyone involved don t put yourself in charge or allow yourself to be put in charge of all the different parts of a project listening to other s ideas will make the project seem more manageable and allow you to let go of some control 16 x research source focus on someone other than yourself try putting some effort into helping others have a good time sometimes bringing the focus off of yourself can be a great distraction when you are having trouble going with the flow putting your focus on someone else will also help you stay present in the moment rather than sinking back into regret or guilt 17 x research source engage them in conversation ask them to join your team on board game night offer to dance with them or get them a drink express your concerns be confident and clear about how you feel about a change in plans or idea as long as you are open to what others have to say your contribution will come off as helpful and you may be able to compromise with your friends think about a night out as a collaborative effort i think seeing the movie after dinner is a good idea but i m worried we might feel rushed to finish our meal in order to get there on time perhaps we should see an earlier show and eat after or see the midnight showing and just get drinks in between what do you guys think i m fine finishing up the spreadsheets but i don t think i will be able to give them the attention they deserve if i m also responsible for assembling the materials for the meeting could we split that task up among the group,Philosophy-and-Religion

about what you need to do after work school plans for the weekend and errands you ll need to run or perhaps you get swept up in the past regretting some decision you made wishing you had said done something differently and thinking about what your situation might be like if you d made different choices these types of thoughts can inhibit your ability to be present and enjoy what you re doing in the here and now learning how to be mindful and more aware of yourself and your surroundings can help you enjoy the moment no matter what you re doing,be present in the moment think about how much time you ve wasted through the years by dwelling on things you can t change from the past or worrying about things you can t predict or alter in the future it can cause you a lot of stress and anxiety when you get lost in that way of thinking especially when you recognize how powerless you are to alter the past or future the only thing you can change is this present moment right now and it starts with being mindful of where you are what you re doing and what is happening around you observe what is happening around you without judgment simply notice your environment and any events unfolding around you try to describe in your head or out loud your surroundings or any events happening in your immediate environment focus on concrete observable sensory information 1 x research source notice how you fit in with your environment as you breathe in the air around you walk across the ground or sit quietly recognize without judgment that you are temporarily a part of this place 2 x research source eliminate distractions there are many things that might distract you from enjoying a moment in addition to the countless thoughts running through your head you might easily become distracted by your electronic device s incoming text messages phone calls emails and social media updates can all distract you from whatever you re trying to do whether you want to spend quality time with others or simply sit alone in a calm environment your cellphone or your friends phones can quickly ruin the moment personal devices like cellphones and tablets can distract you from a moment whether it s a moment spent alone or with others try scheduling your device usage making time for device free activities or simply turning your phone off when you re trying to enjoy a moment alone or with others 3 x

on the sensation of air flowing in through your nostrils and back out notice the way your breath feels on your nostrils in your chest and all the way down to your diaphragm below your ribcage feel your belly rise and fall with each slow deep breath any time your attention starts to drift to other thoughts simply return your focus to the sensation and experience of breathing mindfully 5 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source ignore fleeting thoughts it s easy to feel as though your thoughts are in control especially during a crisis or moments of anxiety but it s important to remember during these moments that you have the power to decide whether or not to engage with a given thought with practice and mindfulness you can eventually observe your thoughts and choose whether to dwell in those thoughts or let them pass you by 6 x research source an important component of mindfulness is accepting your thoughts as they are without judging them holding onto them or resisting them remember that your thoughts are immaterial they only gain meaning when you give them meaning do not try to push unpleasant thoughts away as this may only make your mind dwell on the discomfort of that thought similarly do not try to grasp at pleasant thoughts imagine each thought that drifts into your mind like clouds floating across the sky if you do not like a particular thought simply wait without engaging it and it will slowly pass by and drift away let go of the past it can be very easy to get lost in memories there s nothing wrong with enjoying your past success or learning from your past mistakes in fact you actually should do those things but dwelling on things that are no longer around or relevant or obsessing about things you can t do anything about like wishing you d said done something differently will only cause you stress and anxiety 7 x research source it s important to recognize that there is nothing you can do in the present moment that can alter the past once you accept that you cannot change the past you begin to take away its power over you think to yourself i cannot change the past so what good will it do to worry about it even though you cannot do anything to alter the past you do have the option of controlling the present by living mindfully you determine how to live in this very moment avoid thinking about the future you might be thinking about the future in anticipation like waiting for the weekend or in dread like contemplating how bad monday will be when your weekend is over it s good to be motivated by your ambitions for the future but dwelling on the future in any way makes you lose track of the present it can make fun times go by more quickly or it can fill you with a sense of dread as you anticipate things that you can t control in this moment 8 x research source when you think about the future you forfeit your ability to fully be present in this very moment avoid looking at your watch checking your cellphone or anticipating anything that isn t relevant to what you re doing right now instead of getting caught up in what might will happen practice mindfulness and work to be present in this very moment in this very moment you can decide how to act what to say which thoughts to engage with and what mindset you will hold on to these choices will affect your future so it s important to make the most of what you can do in the here and now practice acceptance you may be tempted to force some type of evaluation on the present moment perhaps you re thinking about how much better this moment is than a moment last week or you might be thinking this moment would be made better if some other factor were different however these types of evaluations can hamper your ability to mindfully enjoy the present moment as it is instead work to accept every moment and let thoughts or emotions exist without imposing values or judgments 9 x research source resist the urge to judge any kind of value statement thought can be a judgment even considering something cool or fun or beautiful judgments extend beyond people and places you may be judging the situation you re in the weather you re exposed to or even the thoughts running through your head mindfulness requires you to work at accepting things as they are without imposing value or judgment on them this takes work but once you are able to accept things in the present moment you will feel much more at peace any time you find yourself judging someone or something try to catch yourself and stop yourself in mid thought think to yourself i will let this pass without judgment and try to let go of that thought try to recognize that enjoying this moment as it is without judgment or desire will make it that much more meaningful to you that meaning will stay with you as a strong positive memory of the present moment meditate the basic goal of most meditations is to focus on the present moment without distraction or disturbance 10 x research source this may sound easy in theory but it can take a lot of work to cultivate a mindful meditation practice however any effort you put into meditating will reward you with a sense of calmness and an enhanced perspective of the present choose whether to meditate while sitting comfortably or while walking slowly through a peaceful environment focus on your breath take deep breaths down into your diaphragm feeling your belly rise and fall with each breath scan your body and notice any physical sensations you re experiencing you might feel the air moving through your nostrils the sensation of the floor underneath you a sense of calm or even a sense of fear anxiety do not judge the sensations you notice and do not try to hold on to them simply acknowledge their existence and let go of them any time a thought enters your head do not force it away or cling to it much like the sensations you noticed you should acknowledge that thought s existence and simply let it go any time you lose focus or become distracted return to your breathing and focus on the sensation of each breath focus on your senses your brain has a seemingly endless river of thoughts rushing through it at any given moment these thoughts help you most of the time but they can be distracting or even damaging the best way to quiet your mind is to focus on what s observable take note of concrete tangible sensory information and force your mind to dwell on the sights sounds smells tastes and physical sensations of your environment 11 x research source look around you and notice the intricate arrangement of the world around you let yourself listen to the sounds of your environment if you are in a noisy area like a crowded coffee shop try to listen to the steady hum of all the voices together instead of trying to single out individual sounds feel the chair couch floor under your bottom and take note of the ways your legs and rear end feel against that surface notice the way your feet touch the floor the way your hands rest on your lap or on the arm rests at your sides don t force yourself to appreciate the things around you if you are fully present you will become aware of everything in your immediate environment as you observe your surroundings with your senses resist the urge to evaluate them think of them as simply being rather than as being good or bad try to appreciate the little things you may be tempted to think of your life as a series of big events and those events are important but don t forget that your life is also composed of countless little moments which are available to you every day one of the easiest ways to enjoy a moment is to mindfully engage with that moment and appreciate it for what it is you can do this in countless little ways each day to bring greater meaning and peace to every moment 12 x research source slow down each day to appreciate the way things look sound taste smell and feel when you shower notice the sensation of rubbing shampoo into your hair or soap on your body every time you eat slow down and notice your food the way it looks smells tastes chew slowly and think about how much water sunlight and farm work went into creating that meal engage with each moment fully and eventually you will learn to enjoy and appreciate every aspect of every moment learn to see other perspectives if you re upset about something that a friend relative or colleague said did that frustration can quickly ruin an otherwise enjoyable moment it s easy to feel angry with others when you view that person s actions from your own point of view but it s worth considering that his her choice made sense to that individual when you feel yourself becoming upset with another person take a moment to step back force yourself to think of three positive reasons that someone might have said done the thing that upset you focus on positive reasons don t say things like he did it to upset me or he doesn t know what he s doing as you come up with positive reasons work to see the situation from that individual s perspective he or she probably had a rational reason for the behavior at hand which you might be blind to because you re locked in your own perspective learning to see things from other people s perspectives can help you see situations more objectively making you more calm and in the moment it can also help you become a more understanding empathetic individual 13 x research source,Philosophy-and-Religion

empathetic and they have higher self esteem being in the moment may sound simple but in truth it takes a lot of practice read on to learn changes you can make to the way you think spend your time and

the moment that is happening as you read take comfort in the fact that it is physically impossible for you to be anywhere else it s never too late to be in the moment all you have to do is realize you re already there the challenge is to turn your thoughts toward what is happening in the present or to become more mindfully aware mindfulness happens when you notice and acknowledge the present when

decision to stop worrying so much when you find yourself obsessing do something to bring about greater mindfulness like stepping outside and breathing fresh air for a few moments don t ruminate on the past this is even less useful than worrying about the future because it has already happened and there s nothing you can do to change it for example if you have wounds from the past let go of them be unselfconscious when your inner critic comments on your behavior you re creating a separation between your mind and body making it more difficult to live in the present as an example let s say you re in the middle of talking to a friend you start laughing at something funny he said and then you immediately criticize yourself for laughing to loud or you start worrying about what your face looks like when you laugh now your thoughts are ruling the experience and you re no longer living in the moment with your friend you re worried about the impression you re making 3 x research source you re not present anymore the next time something like this happens banish the negative thoughts immediately if you experience self consciousness frequently try doing something you re good at something you

person s face and think about your relationship to this person even unpleasant conversations or conversations with people you hardly know or with whom you don t have much in common can have extraordinary value everyone has a history a dream desires being in the moment during conversations can help you experience greater empathy and feel more in tune with the world as buddha taught we are all interconnected 5 x research source take people at face value do you spend a lot of time worrying about other people s intentions judgements and desires this is yet another distraction from the present moment you can t control anyone but yourself so why spend so much time thinking about someone else s thoughts the best way to stop this pattern is to start taking people at face value believe other people s words then move on to the next experience instead of dwelling it s true that some people mean no when they say yes and vice versa everyone says things they don t mean sometimes however it is not your job to attempt to read people s minds if there s a miscommunication because you acted on a yes as a yes that person will learn to be more direct next time take compliments at face value do people the kindness of believing what they say instead of thinking they re saying it just to be nice this is not to say you should be naive and have complete trust in everyone a person s body language history and personality should tell you whether or not a person can be trusted accept pain when life brings tragedy being in the moment means experiencing pain instead of trying to ignore it

wrapped up in past occurrences or worries about the future if you re sad about a breakup let the sadness be part of your current moment don t dwell on memories or think about what might have been just bask in the feeling of sadness looking at a picture of the person s face or writing down your thoughts can help you connect your emotions to the present 6 x research source don t berate yourself for having negative feelings telling yourself you should get over something more quickly is a way of disconnecting yourself from the present because the emotions are part of the present ride out your

on any one task you can t be totally present because your thoughts are jumping to the next project or worrying about an email half written or planning the meeting that s happening tomorrow turning your focus to just one thing at a time is a way of being in the moment as a bonus you ll do a much better job at any given task if it s the only thing on your mind try to finish every task you start give yourself enough time to do a thorough job and do it from start to finish before moving on to the next item on your to do list some projects can t be completed all at once for bigger projects set manageable goals that can be met in one sitting for example if you re writing a book decide you re going to spend 3 hours focusing fully on the book write what you can during this time then put your materials away before moving to the next item go slowly rushing through tasks is not much better than multitasking when it comes to being in the moment if all you can think about is getting a chore done as fast as possible you aren t giving yourself the chance to really experience what you re doing all your mind and body to act as one for as long as it takes to get the job done think about

essential oils every day you ll awaken receptors and be able to pick up on subtler smells after awhile to heighten your hearing listen to music with distinct sounds like jazz music with several solos

retreat locale to host you for the day alert the people close to you let people know about your choice to stay silent you don t need to tell everyone but it will be easier to stay silent if you inform the people you talk to regularly tell your spouse children parents co workers or teachers before you begin your day without talking 4 x research source if you have important interactions with people like parents or teachers throughout your day let them know when you plan to be silent so they know what s going on with you if you re staying silent for a day in protest to your parents telling them beforehand will make the situation less tense and less likely to worsen simply tell them when you ll be ready to talk you might say mom i m participating in national day of silence tomorrow just so you know i will not be speaking for the whole day if you have something to discuss with me we can do it today or the day after consider asking a friend to be silent with you if your goal is to conduct a social experiment or engage in a political protest it may be appropriate to ask a friend to participate with you afterward you ll be able to reflect on the day together 5 x research source try saying hey george do you want to do day of silence with me it s a day where students around the country don t speak as a way to protest the silence that lgbtq people face regularly i think will be a good experience you up for it if your goal is strictly personal it might be better to go ahead with your day on your own think in advance about how you ll communicate politely it is likely that you will encounter situations where you must talk in order to get an important message across avoid being rude or disrespectful when possible for example if one of your teachers doesn t know that you plan to go through the day without talking you might have to write them a note or simply tell them if you are participating in national day of silence for example consider carrying around a note that explains that you are protesting the silence that lgbtq youth face daily 6 x research source remember to use gestures if you are spending a day in public use your body language to communicate you can smile point shake your head and otherwise move your body to communicate what you need 7 x research source use short and meaningful words if you have to speak if you must open your mouth be conscious of the words you choose remember that your goal is to speak as little as possible use the minimal words necessary to communicate 8 x research source for example a teacher might stop to ask you about a change in time for your club meeting the next day if for some reason you can t give them a pamphlet listen to everything they say before you jump in to give explanations if there is only one good time for your club try saying 3 30 if not we can cancel tomorrow breathe whenever you are tempted to say something breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth inhale slowly as you count to five hold your breath for a few seconds exhale as you count to eight focusing on your breathing calms you 9 x research source it may also help distract you from the urge to talk observe the challenge notice how challenging it is to go a day without speaking whatever your motive staying silent will give you time to notice things you may not have noticed before observe your feelings others reactions and the overall experience of not using your voice 10 x research source if your day is personal and spent alone notice the thoughts and desires that surface whether you choose to spend the day meditating or simply spend some time alone take note of what comes up for you notice your relationship with silence think deeply about your experience or even write about it consider keeping a journal or creating a voice recording of your experience to help you refer back to your experience in the future question how it made you feel and why staying silent had an emotional effect on you by asking questions like 11 x research source how difficult was the day for you what did you find challenging what did you notice about the environment you were in what did you notice about the people around you how did they react to you how often did you find that you wanted to speak was it uncomfortable relieving discuss with a friend talk to your friends or family about your day let them know the impact it had on you and your outlook on life ask them how it felt when you were silent they may also have interesting insights 12 x research source if you were silent with a friend debrief after the day is over have a conversation in which you compare and contrast your experiences you will probably learn more about your unique qualities and your friend s inner world after the conversation determine if you were successful after investigating your relationship with speaking and after talking with others you may be able to analyze the success of your day maybe your purpose was simply to observe yourself or maybe it was to reflect deeply on a social issue ask yourself if you fulfilled your original goal if not what could you do better next time,Philosophy-and-Religion
how to practice mindfulness of death meditation,while there are certainly more meditations out there that are harder to do this one is one of the hardest to do well even for experienced meditators this meditation in fact is more or less insight focused since it can t be developed very far by means of concentration or be much use for relaxation but the scope of benefits are vast indeed what seems such a grim and depressing meditation has such a beautiful and enlivening aspect that a wise practitioner will examine and put into fruition can you master this complex technique,choose a quiet peaceful place to meditate and a comfortable posture the do mindful meditation pages looks at the four postures in a little more detail but any of the four will do for this subject this meditation shouldn t be attempted by those in distress in an unbalanced frame of mind or those inclined to fantasy and should have a firm grounding of mindfulness before starting the practitioner should recognize that the focus of the meditation is totally objective and scientific not personalized where eg loving kindness or goodwill is focused specifically towards individuals and people in mind this one is not as with other meditations sincerity is essential but the practice of virtue is also highly important in this meditation firstly consider the many ways this meditation can go astray just like many other meditations this one seldom stays on target and the mind wanders about in a whole scope of ways the problem is a complicated duality in the mind part of the mind wants to look into the subject of death another part wants not only deny it but to stay as far away from the subject as possible some examples of many to avoid thinking about are the death of yourself in terms of fantasy such as how you d imagine your funeral who you would see and what you would like to say to them how you will die as it provokes fear and anxiety how other people that you love will die since it will make you sad or anxious how others will die that you don t like because it will make you feel glad for all the wrong reasons where you and others will go after death this often causes the most problems as the mind starts to become anxious or is more likely to become prone to fantasy falling into melancholia or other emotions such as regret fear anger worry etc crudely speaking if the practitioner feels sad or angry etc it is a very clear sign they are not doing it right and so will need to start again relax the tension and spend another few moments practicing awareness to become perfectly aware of what is going on in the mind if it is still unsettled it is best to relax and focus on some aspect such as the breath a bit further or to move to a different meditation practice such as mindfulness meditation of death can be very depression once you feel that you are relaxed stable and aware start to consider one of all of the following suggestions keeping consistent awareness in check consider the event of death as having the appearance of an assassin no matter when or where you are you won t escape this appointment consider the indifference of the end of life no matter how successful you are in your ventures or how much you plan beg or negotiate there is nothing that can prevent it expand you scope and compare to all peoples the famous and wealthy those who do good things those who are very strong mentally or physically had perfect health etc those with power technology etc were sages saints prophets or wise people none could prevent death it s not a matter of ability or attainments or personal status consider how the body is composite and an ecosystem your body is host to bacteria in the gut viruses parasites skin flora etc likewise composite in the biological sense of blood flesh etc these things can keep you alive in the normal sense or make you fatally ill if any part becomes infected observe the conditional nature of life you need food water sleep air light the right temperatures etc you need the organs and muscles to be able to breath pump blood digest food etc you need the ability to get food and know safety and danger etc can you live without them evaluate it can be natural or unnatural death may occur in our sleep or we may be involved in an accident or other event it can be at our choosing or without our choosing consider its unpredictability we will never really know how long life is when the time comes how or where there s no way to properly define how and when with 100 certainty think about the shortness of life a long life is 90 to 100 years few live beyond that or even make it that far days soon become weeks months years etc look at the shortness of the moment we are only here now the past is gone and the future isn t here yet tomorrow technically never comes there s only the now which doesn t stop because people die measure these against you own experiences of people you know that have died also expand to understanding that death happens constantly everywhere on earth something or someone somewhere is dying right now this section is about recognizing that everyone experiences a struggle against death at some point or often in their lives either out of fear despair anger and other concerns nobody wants death when they live happy lives but it is important to reflect there are many people who do not live happy lives and become either embittered by unhappiness or experience so much pain they wish to end their lives regardless of our own levels of happiness and aspirations it comes to us all regardless of who we are and what wonderful things we may attain it too will come to us eventually the fight against it as well as the feelings about death and what comes afterwards causes so much distress sorrow and anger in the world and ourselves the practitioner should question the wisdom of extreme emotions when we may die in a few seconds days months years or decades the things we cannot predict may be jut around the corner start to develop ways of accepting the fact by measuring against your own experiences have there been times that death has caused you fear or stress the important aspect to investigate is that did the wanting to know wanting to prevent or change already occurred deaths etc cause you misery ultimately what leads us back every time to the four noble truths is the wanting of things to be or not to be the question for the practitioner then to investigate is does the stress fear anger etc abate when that desire is released start now to practice ways of improving the well being of your life while the facts of life may cause of sorrow and despair it still doesn t need to be so some ways of many to improve your happiness and well being are listed as follows but the practitioner should reflect again that without sincerity it will be virtually impossible to come to terms and transcend the issues practice virtue the innocent really do have nothing to fear practice investigative understanding the wise likewise have nothing to fear as they know that we can hasten illness unhappiness and injury by living carelessly practice appreciation when we are unhappy with what we have by valuing the many things that touch our hearts we balance out the dissatisfaction and we can build appreciation to make it of greater value practice goodwill or loving kindness not just to others but ourselves when we fell angry about how we cannot prevent death or that there isn t someone we can turn to to do it for us practice equanimity this pulls us back into balance when we run off into fits of emotion equanimity is the great balancer practice compassion compassion finally reminds us that all beings are in the same boat bound to the same wheel of life only when we understand how we are bound to it will we ever be free of it,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to practice body mindfulness meditation,body mindfulness is one of the forty buddhist meditations it is a meditation designed both for investigation of the body and its nature as well as being a basis for concentration building this meditation is excellent for people who have an anatomical medical or health interest in the body familiarity with the body helps in building concentration on the other hand it s often hardest for people who are the most sensitive towards the body either in regards to its appearance or because they are uneasy with the body s biological processes in spite of this dislike it s recommended that such persons try this style of meditation because they re likely to get the greatest rewards from it of course starting gently and building up experience will help ease newcomers into it here s how to start the meditation and develop it further,select a quiet comfortable place to meditate choose an appropriate time when you feel able to meditate free from distractions select a posture comfortable for you for this meditation all postures are suitable the how to do mindful meditation page describes the four main postures in a little more detail to help you choose one that is practical for you ensure your head and torso are positioned to allow for ease of breathing and awareness having a stiff posture will cause discomfort and a too soft posture will encourage sleepiness relax any tension spend a few moments developing awareness of what you are doing such as sitting breathing and relaxing spending a few minutes this way allows the mind to build more focus and awareness as it examines the body for tension allowing the body to relax also lets your mind become calm and quietened give yourself a few minutes for this to occur and let go of distractions agendas and other subjects of thought mentally divide the body into its component parts start generally with arms legs torso and head as you mentally note the location of each component start to divide it up further to become more aware of smaller details for example the arm may become shoulder upper arm elbow lower arm wrist palm fingers etc spend a minute being both aware of each part but also how they feel such as tense or relaxed hot or cold and so on the purpose is to be aware of not only where they are but what they are how they feel and so on building to a complete body awareness start to mentally note individual parts of the body in more detail there is a typical repetition worth learning that runs along the lines of 1 head hair body hair teeth skin nails 2 muscles sinews bones bone marrow kidneys 3 heart liver stomach spleen lungs 4 bowel intestines feces undigested food brain 5 bile phlegm pus blood sweat body fat 6 tears skin grease snot saliva bone lubricant and urine the traditional order of this list seems unusual but the list divides the body components into two classes solid matter and liquid matter it starts with some of the most easily recognizable external parts head hair skin etc then moves on to more internal parts increasing in complexity as you go what you are doing more or less is a kind of mental ct scan of your body if you have seen scans before you see bones muscles organs etc this is what you are looking for in situ and in action it may or may not appear visually to you like a ct scan but you may feel a sensation or another form of awareness of that body part now spend a moment being aware of each part in turn there is a host of things recommended as a point of study so you may choose any that feel relevant to you at the beginning and then work on to the more complex aspects give each part some time to be studied to gain an understanding familiarity and insight while at the same time direct a calm and relaxed focus towards its nature 1 examine its location in the body how it feels what it is how it is how it came to be what it needs to continue to be etc 2 examine your experiences of how your mind interacts with the body component such as how the heart changes when there is tension in the mind and how the muscles react when there is discomfort 3 examine your experiences of how the body interacts with mental states when there is tension unease fear how does the body feel when there is gradual relaxation in the mind is there gradual relaxation in the body there are many other questions you may ask in this theme 4 is there attachment or any wishes that occur to you in relation to that part of the body the more sensitive practitioner may find the meditation somewhat unnerving and feel squeamish or maybe even think it s gross and weird this method can be used to break down any such squeamishness and other barriers allowing for a tolerance and acceptance to be built on increased understanding of and familiarity with the body 5 consider how fragile the ecosystem of your body is one example is to examine how the blood needs pumping to oxygenate it prevent it from clotting and becoming fatal the blood being pumped helps the immune and healing system and since it helps regulate body temperature we feel cold or hot when the circulation is not free 6 consider how co dependent it is on other aspects of the body and external facts such as food and water air temperature and so on consider how enduring each part is or how much it changes 7 consider how many of the bodily processes and parts run and are maintained on their own independent of us or on autopilot if you will the identity has no involvement in running the liver for example it just works away even when we are deeply asleep if you wish you can spend the entire meditation on just one part or one group however if you wish to do the entire body move on to the next group muscles sinews bones bone marrow kidneys again be aware of each part as above examine the body again and relax any parts that you can should you be aware that they are tense or in an uncomfortable position this meditation essentially works to break down denial fear and squeamishness while building familiarity with as well as awareness and understanding of the body you feed to keep alive by examining its conditional nature as well as its fragility and unavoidable exposure to chances of injury illness pain and organ failure and the inevitability of aging you can learn to accept the body as it is by becoming disenchanted but at the same time compassionate and at peace with the body it s not a shock or distressing should it get injured grow old feel hungry or become ill by using the body as a means of study you can learn to live with the body and its warning signs you will no longer feel unnerved about it generally many people have found this meditation very helpful for directed relaxation pain management increased immune responsiveness and in more rare cases to see which parts of the body are injured or out of alignment you can also focus a compassionate healing energy onto various parts or simply allow the part of the body in question some space to relax and repair itself to aid recovery in some cases instead of fighting it worrying about it and causing other stress related problems this is more advanced for people who have practiced for a long time but it s a very useful tool to develop for those who wish to go further on this subject method let go of any distractions that may arise and keep examining and studying the part your body or continue through the list this is another place where mindfulness and concentration comes in and is excellent to develop the mind to focus to develop this meditation further for deeper concentration start to drop away the repetition of words to develop wordless awareness fix your awareness on the component part of the body that is most evident to you should a particular part simply become visible or more noticeable by feeling or some image focus and develop that awareness letting it become the sole object of your focus and awareness examine it more simply but in whole so if a color arises it is recommended to not pay too much attention on the color but instead to focus on what part of the body the color refers to mastering this does take time and indeed it can take many years before it becomes a powerfully insightful tool beginners should not be concerned if nothing happens at all in regards to increased awareness for some it might just appear on focus for others they might need to look at some strands of head hair collected from a brush and put in the hand you examine those as per kasina meditation until an image arises for some it will never happen as this is not the right type of meditation for them regularly measure against your own experiences how or where this meditation has bought you any benefit it might have been an increase in general concentration or a deeper understanding of the body to allow you to live more happily and healthy the analogy of the lotus applies here too the lotus grows in mud and dirty water but rises above it to stand free mentally we can rise above the aspects of the body that we would otherwise find disgusting stressful or frightening and so stand free from shock or fear,Philosophy-and-Religion

natural breath is it shallow deep laboured or otherwise do not try to change it just notice how it is at this time next move your attention to the area between your upper lip and nostrils see if you can feel the breath as it enters and leaves the body in this tiny area try throughout the day to keep a background awareness of the breath as it enters and leaves the body do you feel different when doing this do you feel more in control while you are doing this are you aware of any problems are you worrying about anything do you feel calm it is simple to bring your attention within yourself in this way this practice allows you to stay focused on the breath how you are feeling any sensations in the body and it occupies the mind in the present instead of in the past or future worries take this a step further mindfulness in action can help your life become a living meditation now you are starting to become more self aware more aware of how you react in certain situations it is time to bring mindfulness to your everyday activities the purpose is to keep the mind in the present moment focused on what you are doing now usually the mind is concerned with past challenges or future worries however when you stop and look around at this moment what is actually happening to cause you stress or upset is it all happening in your mind wouldn t it be great to be free of that to assist with being in the present moment keep a background awareness on the breath during whatever you are doing you can bring mindfulness into all situations take walking for example start by noticing each footstep the rise and fall of the foot the strides you take and how it feels in your body to walk mostly walking is just an activity that is given no thought however when you bring your attention to it you can experience walking in a different way in the same way you can bring mindfulness into eating washing the dishes cleaning dressing showering driving working talking and any other activity you are engaged in the purpose is to give the mind something to do in the present moment which in turn halts the otherwise anxious and debilitating thoughts that tend to otherwise inhabit the mind rest and focus at the end of the day you can greatly assist your mindfulness practice by sitting quietly with your eyes shut and focusing on the breath this helps to keep you calm relaxed and it instills the new behaviour of mindfulness awareness into your consciousness being mindful at first can feel strange and unnatural since you are focusing on things that you usually do on automatic pilot however the benefits are huge you will start to become more self aware conscious of how you function without awareness which can assist you with breaking the cycles of anxiety and depression mindfulness can be used very effectively to identify the thoughts that cause stress and alert you that it is time to maybe see things in a different way once you become aware of how your thoughts affect how you feel react interact and function in the world it becomes easier to challenge them and look at things with a new perspective,Philosophy-and-Religion

you cope with challenges you become more attuned to your body it can also help you to feel more in control and less overwhelmed learn to stay focused in the present be willing to face challenges with patience and acceptance through self reflection and mindfulness exercises,pay attention to how your body reacts your body will often tell you more about how you re feeling than you realize when you re faced with a difficult challenge you may feel anxious angry or sad pay close attention to your body for triggers before you get upset or overreact these are signs that actually help you to see your emotional state 1 x research source notice if you are sweating more or have increased muscle tension you may be feeling very anxious and not yet emotionally realize it pay attention to any fidgety behaviors such as restless legs or constantly touching your face or hair you may be upset or anxious see how your body may retract maybe you inadvertently face away from whatever is bothering you or look away to avoid eye contact you may feel sad or upset about the recent challenges you re encountering think carefully before you speak be thoughtful about what you say and how you say it though you may initially react to a challenge out of frustration be aware that that frustration often comes with impaired thinking give yourself a little time to gather your thoughts before you speak 2 x research source think of how to have a positive spin on a difficult situation for example if you re facing a difficult semester at school think about the classes that you enjoy and challenge you in a good way some classes are hard for a good reason they help you to think critically and look at things more deeply make sure to pause for at least three seconds before you immediately say something these few seconds can give you time to process in your head if this is the best way to react to the situation find a safe space to breathe deeply when things are overwhelming and you need a minute to gather your thoughts consider stepping away from the situation find a space that is private where you can have a few minutes to focus on deep breathing exercises 3 x research source excuse yourself politely from the situation consider giving yourself an excuse such as needing to use the restroom or that you need to take a minute to check on something you can also simply say hold on a minute i need a moment to think i will be back shortly do deep breathing exercises one example is to slowly inhale for a few seconds hold your breath for five seconds then slowly exhale for a few seconds repeat this a few times or as many times as can help you to clear your thoughts and feel more refreshed resist the temptation to argue or fight while you may want to handle a difficult challenge by

challenged by your parent s strict behaviors about what you should and should not do in life while you may get upset and want to yell and scream this is unlikely to change their mind and can be physically and emotionally exhausting for you think about ways to argue in a peaceful and mature way about the points you want to make think about how they may have strict rules because they care about you consider saying things like i don t want to fight or argue i just want to come to some understanding when things get heated avoid overanalyzing the situation overanalyzing what happened and why can be mentally and physically draining at times while it is important to look critically at a situation avoid dwelling on the what ifs of the situation try to stay focused on the present and future instead 5 x research source overanalyzing can lead to heightened anxiety about what to do this may cause you to freeze up and avoid handling a situation pay attention to how often your mind wanders to negative thoughts about the challenges you re facing for example let s say you re in a competition at school and someone else gets first place in the competition you may dwell on why they got first place and you didn t you may feel frustrated by the results or be hard on yourself for not being better when your thoughts appears to be dwelling on the negative stop yourself write down three good things that are currently happening in the present for you remind yourself that your thoughts are just thoughts they do not represent reality and you can learn to push through them be forgiving with yourself and others when you face challenges you may be quick to blame yourself or someone else be mindful of this negativity and how it may impact your ability to move on if you are constantly feeling resentful or guilty focus on what you can do to make things better for yourself and others instead 6 x research source for example let s say you are facing a roadblock at work with a project you feel like you don t have enough background or experience with something you may feel like blaming yourself for not being more prepared or having the right skill set instead focus on what you can do to make it better devote your energy to the present and future rather than wishing to change the past remind yourself that new projects will bring new challenges these things are supposed to be difficult but you can still rise to the occasion if you are resentful of others find ways to either work with them more effectively in the future or spend more time with people who are positive and supportive of you use mindfulness exercises to stay present in the here and now being mindful means putting away the stressors and anxiety you may be feeling and instead focusing on the simpler things in life by slowing down your thoughts your body and your breath you can feel more in control of challenges that you face consider these various exercises to help you calm down and stay in the present 7 x research source yoga this can help to stretch your body and muscles in different ways as well as slow down your movements meditation this can help you with racing or anxious thoughts deep

sunshine be creativity with art music cooking or other creative works stop multitasking focus your attention on one activity at a time avoid relying on technology and your phones 24 7 instead be more connected with people face to face be grateful and have fun don t take yourself too seriously laugh and enjoy yourself more accept challenges as a part of life while you may wish that you never had to face challenges the reality is that challenges are simply a part of life be mindful of how each person is facing some sort of obstacle in their lives currently you are not the only one who is facing difficult challenges 9 x research source find challenges as a way to get more connected with other people through common struggles you may feel greater bonds try to find meaning and value in the challenges that you have faced and are facing now often long after you ve faced something difficult you can find value and purpose in this experience for example let s say you had a set back and failed an exam after that maybe you tried even harder to do well in the class it changed your thinking about how to approach studying find resilience through challenges resilience helps to give you strength it motivates you to keep going and not give up challenges in life work and relationships may make you want to give in and give up try to stay strong and remember your strengths 10 x research source write down three strengths in your personality work and life that make you resilient write a few sentences that are encouraging and self affirming about your strengths find a role model that can help you focus on the positives and build up your motivation to keep going reach out to friends family or mentors that have faces bigger hurdles and overcame them they are likely to have wisdom focus on the small steps as much as the big picture when you face a big challenge you may get bogged down by all the things in your way you may feel overwhelmed by how seemingly insurmountable the situation may feel try to break down the big picture into smaller and more manageable steps consider creating a timeline for each the small steps that can eventually lead to the big steps for example let s say you want to apply for college but aren t sure about all the things you need to do in order to get this done create a checklist of all the things you need to send or have completed for your application then create a timeline for how and when to accomplish each task appreciate each completed step as a goal you ve reached see that as something to be proud of each step should be meaningful and uplifting as you make progress toward your ultimate goal,Philosophy-and-Religion

how to develop mindful leadership,mindful leadership is a new buzzword in corporate training that develops skill building and awareness in all aspects of management this tutorial explores how to start developing your skills on how to be the best leader you can be,explore the foundations of mindfulness mindfulness in essence is not just being aware but more importantly being engaged and dynamic with yourself and your surroundings this allows you to be more creative realistic and pragmatic with every situation in a business context or any leadership role the art of being more aware as well as more creative significantly enhances opportunities addresses potential challenges and creates a more fulfilling personal life start by finding the present moment a simple method is to close your office door sit in a comfortable chair and close your eyes be aware of your breath your sensations in the chair or just background noises mindfulness should ultimately be effortless but at the beginning many of the subtle aspects may not be apparent to you but will with time become more and more evident exposing things that you may not have been aware of the purpose of this exercise is simply to draw you into the present moment this means that you aren t being tied down to the past experiences future deadlines or other distractions that get in the way of being able to process information to make an informed decision ultimately everything is in the present moment even though the past present and future condition the way people think and act critically this method is not just a relaxation method in which you can refresh your mind but it allows things to settle which often allows a creative solution to become evident be present as often as possible mindful leadership is not just awareness but being able to see and listen to what is happening all around you interestingly mindfulness is also critically linked with memory so it enhances dynamic memory but also allows memory to be more versatile one of the major challenges in a busy environment is being aware of what s going on often there is simply too much happening at once mindfulness allows you to accept your situation delegate and prioritise your workload as well as the people and projects around you so it prevents a blockage in the flow and allows solutions to be implemented in the most efficient and effective way consider the dynamics in your environment specifically this is the quality of your interactions with coworkers various levels of management the customer and supplier dynamic in the market and your own relationship with your own role the principle purpose of this exposes all the underlying relationships that you may or may not be aware of and because of the fascinating relationship mindfulness shares with memory the relationships that have simply faded away from our awareness reflecting on these often expose potential benefits as well as conflicts that should be explored often leaders can be rather laissez faire or depending too much on simple improvisation these in themselves can be exceptionally useful in various contexts but not all mindfulness can allow you to pick and choose a more relevant management style that suits the situation be daily aware of your own emotions and personal health by recognising your state of mind in the moment is of enormous potential benefit the reasons for this is if you are tired and overworked or controlled by desire or anger to win or control then you are sewing failure or at best a compromised result into any project you undertake a major one to keep an eye out is the inner control freak or too busy mind state both in yourself and in others as well as the state of mind that consistently looks for the faults in things these are in themselves amazingly effective obstacles to creativity and narrowing the depth you can see into things by letting go and stepping back to allow others to progress or by developing means of cooperation can create a more harmonious effective and value based solution to most parts of life likewise reflect on your own energy none can be 100 perfect all of the time so occasionally your own wellbeing and energy levels will be affected this allows you to recognise and act to unwind and relax which also can inspire your colleagues to look after their own personal wellbeing and development be aware of your thoughts intentions and plans often people tend to ignore the thought process unless it says what they want to hear and this reveals a critical divorce from the present moment as we simply don t want to engage the situation fully so we cannot create a holistic or complete solution additionally this is robbing you of much in the way of developing new skills and can dramatically pull down your motivation and well being by changing our perception subtly or taking a fresh look after a break this gives new energy to resolve old problems ideas can often be practical but very often can be misguided and unhelpful if you aren t fully aware of the context by being aware of them you can dissect the thoughts and abandon those that are impractical or unbeneficial but at the same time developing the practical and beneficial ones thus training the mind to incline towards being more confident calm creative and practical it is amazing to discover for yourself exactly when you are being led around by your internal deeper intentions that may be against your personal direct goals gut feeling can often be something that is misused gut instinct to an experienced person is often surprisingly accurate in negotiations when determining when the person at the other end of the table is being honest but often stronger desires can certainly shape the perception into being inaccurate the desire to sign a deal can set you up for a very compromised result find your inner cool this helps you be more calm generally in crisis management but also helps you see beyond the poker face of many negotiators and their goals there is a subtle difference between cool and aloof so it is useful to distinguish the two in relationship to this method stepping back for a little quiet time observing more closely or by varying team leaders if necessary so that a stale environment can be revived will often allow many issues to resolve themselves start to develop a deductive and productive frame of mind by practicing awareness it becomes clear when you are falling away into fantasy plans and dream goals or stewing away making plans to beat a rival climb the corporate ladder or control others around you being able to distinguish between useful ideas and unskillful ideas both in yourself and from others is a very valuable skill be aware or corporate systems from the ground up so far this tutorial has mostly explored the personal relationships but just as important is the very structure of the organisation being aware of them as they are well expose just how smooth they are many systems and methods may be out of date not followed or sabotaged within an organisation where many not only work very well but are an opportunity to expand as well as recognising and rewarding the people who run them expand your range look outside your own office to explore other companies with their own teams and methods this can help you explore ways to develop your own company s strengths reflect often on your own and others actions this practice has nothing to do with being judgmental but has a lot to do with being able to understand the intentions people have that guide their actions by understanding and recognising them as they happen gives a wide scope for problem solving and creating beneficial results consider how the environment affects you and others in many cases renovating the workspace is money well spent when it makes it safer easier to navigate and more inspiring an environment to work in practice mindfulness as often as possible to begin with you may find it s easy to lose track of time and your awareness falls and that s fine however that in itself is key to the benefits mindfulness can offer when people lose track of what s going on they can too easily make flawed decisions when they simply aren t aware this can expose large weaknesses in your own leadership skills and the structure within the world you operate but also exposes all the areas that you an develop yourself and to train others,Philosophy-and-Religion

else for example if you re studying remind yourself why it s important it may not be important for you to ace 1 quiz or test but it is important for you to succeed in the course that will factor in your quiz or test grade and it is important for you to get good grades so you can graduate or if you re doing work remind yourself why your work is important if the work is a means to an end remind yourself of all the things you can buy because of the work or about all of the fun things you can do once your work day is over pinpoint a specific goal you can work towards it s easy to get bogged

a fun party or to run for 40 minutes without giving up so you can be in better shape repeat or write down a focus mantra when you know exactly what your purpose and goal are you can create a focus mantra that you repeat to yourself whenever you get distracted it can be just a simple phrase that you repeat when you re getting sidetracked that helps get you back in order if repeating this out loud would be make you feel awkward try writing your mantra down on a sticky note and sticking it on your desk your mantra could be something like no more facebook and no more texting until i get my

resolution your intention might be i m going to treat my body better treating your body better may lead to drinking less but that s not the ultimate goal necessarily an intention can be how you want to feel for the day or simply what you d like to get out of the day such as i want to be thankful for the good things that happen today 3 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit

today ensure your intention is actionable if it is goal oriented it doesn t have to be something you can go out and physically do like ride a bike however it should be an active thing can do to make your emotional or physical well being better such as focus on forgiveness or seek out the best in others 6 x research source for instance your intention shouldn t be i want to be skilled as that s not

intentions may not seem related they are treating your body with respect by eating healthy and exercise may result in losing body fat however the focus is on the positive treating your body better phrase your intentions in an active form remove words like try from your intentions instead replace them with active words if you say you will try then you may end up just trying not actually doing the intention look for any hesitation in your phrasing and remove it 9 x research source for instance instead of i am going to try to work on listening today say i am going to be an active listener today write your intention down it s important to make the intention feel real to you and physically writing it down can do that also try saying it out loud both of these tasks will help solidify the intention in your mind 10 x research source you might even try saying the intention a few times in a row to help it stick try meditating on your intention if you hear mediation and get a little nervous don t worry it s not that big of a deal just spend some time with your eyes closed focusing on your breathing for a few minutes as you do bring to mind your intention and think about that statement for a minute or 2 11 x expert source annie lin mba life career coach expert interview 25 november 2019 as you breathe out try to let go of any anxiety you may be feeling about your intention pretend each breath you bring in is a soothing blue that s bringing calm into your body refer back to your intention throughout the day carry it around on a piece of paper in your pocket or write it

work on staying positive about your intention at times you may think what you intend will never come true or that you don t have the willpower to do it that kind of negative self talk will only sabotage your good work so it s important to nip it in the bud when it happens 13 x research source when you find yourself using negative self talk re frame it in a positive way for instance if you think i will never have the body i want re frame it into i may not be able to change myself instantly but i can choose to be kind to my body today today is the only time i have control over you might also say the past is in the past today i can do things differently think about your intentions when you make plans use your intentions to help you make plans that is when you re making long term and even short term plans refer to your intentions to see if your plans will help or hinder your intentions 14 x research source you may need to tweak your plans a little so they fall more in line with your intentions for instance if you decide you are treating your body better you may decide that partying with your friends this weekend isn t a good idea alternatively you may decide to go out to the club with them but choose to only have 1 drink celebrate and be grateful for your successes from time to time think back on the intentions you ve set and consider the ones you ve followed through on

how to get more done on days when you re not focused,we all have days when we re more focused and days where we re less focused on the days when we re less focused it may still be possible to accomplish something here are some ways to help rescue some of the less focused moments,remove external distractions turn off the tv close or put away computers phones or any browser or im windows you re not using turn off any music that prevents you from concentrating if noise from another room or outside is causing your mind to wander shut the door or window to block it out define the task or problem clearly if you don t know what you re working on it s very hard to accomplish it if you re stuck try to articulate precisely how you are stuck often clearly stating the problem will lead to possible courses of action look at whatever project you re putting off what is the part on which you are stuck what one specific thing can you do to make some progress perhaps that is calling somebody who knows what to do perhaps it is just getting started identify one specific step you can take and take it or start to a specific step is not get all of your accounts in order but something like check the account balance for one account that you choose break down larger projects into smaller more manageable tasks choose easy or mindless tasks pull some weeds do the ironing do basic paperwork or clean out a desk drawer if all you do is take care of a few simple tasks at least they will be out of the way some other day when you have more energy or focus sometimes easy tasks can help build the momentum that gets you started on other more difficult tasks low hanging fruit is still fruit choose tasks you enjoy doing or that are important to you often the motivation of doing something fun or rewarding will boost your energy and enthusiasm and thereby your focus put music on if it s appropriate to do so upbeat music can get you started help drown out distracting background noise and give you a little more energy obviously don t use music if it will distract you from your task or interfere with it if your task is to make phone calls or to complete a language lesson leave the music for later get started on something even if it s not the most important thing as long as you can trust yourself to accomplish your more important tasks on days when you are more focused go ahead and choose a less important less taxing task call it a rough draft or a first attempt trying to produce something even if it s not right yet can get you going help you discover where you really are stuck and help with perfectionism work out loud talk through your plans with a friend colleague or adviser or write in a journal or separate document sometimes this process of explaining to another person or to your journal can help you identify the correct course of action it can be better than letting poorly formed thoughts chase around your head keep a to do list sort it by context if you re at work or school and thinking of things that really should be done when you re at home or running errands or vice versa jot those down on a notepad or in a task management program for your phone or computer then commit to get back to them when you have the opportunity declutter unnecessary tasks from your to do lists if you have a lot of tasks that would be nice someday but aren t a priority keep a separate list or tag and filter them if you track your tasks electronically keep your schedule flexible but structured try to keep regular hours if you work or attend classes outside the home part of your schedule will be decided for you if not create some office hours or otherwise set aside task time for yourself even if that means getting up earlier or staying up later build little deadlines into your time management scheme leave time in your schedule for having an occasional day with less focus this may mean working ahead a little on days when you are better focused or simply scheduling time to yourself on weekends to relax and rest create routines that put basic stuff on autopilot otherwise these things become distractions if you need your keys and purse or wallet each day make sure they land in the same spot each evening when you come home fall back on your system and routines at least you will keep up with the basics and if need be keep up appearances try working faster or slower than your normal pace for some tasks especially the simple repetitive ones try racing against yourself as long as you can do so safely and maintain your quality for more complex tasks you may want to slow down and take things step by step sometimes we convince ourselves that we lack the energy needed because we feel that the only way to accomplish something is to throw a lot of speed and energy at it take the opposite view and work at the task slowly and deliberately this frees you up from using a lack of energy as an excuse anything achieved slowly is something achieved reward yourself after you make one phone call or focus to some degree for 15 minutes take a quick break or do something fun,Philosophy-and-Religion

is at night and or you live in a quiet place and you are alone there are always some distracting noises coming from people nature machines etc earplugs can be a bit uncomfortable so do not use them for very long periods at a time e g take a break after an hour make a tally of every time your mind wanders on a 3x5 card divide the card up into three sections morning afternoon and night every time

your mind is likely to drift that s a sign that you should be improving your concentration by getting more sleep or eating a healthy breakfast set aside specific times during the day in order to let your mind wander or your concentration drift if you have a set time during the day say your drift off time is at 5 30 every day when you get back from school or work you may be less likely to sanction drifting off during 11 a m or 3 p m if you catch yourself drifting off during any of the unsanctioned times tell yourself that you have a designated drift off time and try to keep your brain concentrated on whatever task is at hand help improve the flow of oxygen to the brain blood is the main vehicle of oxygen in our bodies but blood gets pooled in the lower half of our bodies as a result of gravity and doesn t push as much oxygen to the brain where it helps improve concentration in order to help oxygenate the brain get up and take a walk every so often to get the blood pumping if you re stuck at work and you can t really carve out the time for exercise try doing exercises at work these can include any number of things including isometric or aerobic exercises remember to

at a time and do it to completion 3 x research source if you jump all over the place and start a new project before you ve finished the last one you re telling your brain that it s okay to switch from one subject to another if you really want to improve your concentration you ll start trying to convince your brain to finish one task before you move onto the next one apply this philosophy to as many

reading do five more pages if it s concentrating do five more minutes find the energy deep within to do five more of whatever you were you doing try the keywords technique in this simple technique the only thing you have to do is to find the right keyword on what you are studying or doing and whenever you lose concentration or feel distracted or your mind wanders to something else start saying that keyword repeatedly in your mind until you come back to the topic at hand the keyword in this technique is not a single fixed word but keeps changing according to your study or work there are no rules to select the keyword and whichever word the person feels that it will bring back his concentration can be used as a keyword example when you are reading an article about the guitar here the keyword guitar can be used start reading each sentence slowly and while reading whenever you feel distracted or not able to understand or concentrate start saying the keyword guitar guitar guitar guitar guitar until your mind comes back to the article and then you can continue your reading and make a habit to do meditation for at least 10 minutes which improves your concentration levels but you see that you only concentrate on meditation first for better improvement or result,Philosophy-and-Religion
