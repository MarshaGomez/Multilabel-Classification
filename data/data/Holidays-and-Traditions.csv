the chair look for a coworker who uses a seat cushion or leaves his her sweater hanging off the back of the chair place the whoopee cushion either under the seat cushion or against the back of the chair if using the back of the chair drape your coworker s sweater over it so that the whoopee cushion will remain hidden make sure the coworker you choose has a good sense of humor many people would

works it ll be well worth it 18 x research source make sure the fake newspaper isn t offensive or inappropriate for work you can also upload photos to your computer and put together a fake office

office equipment is something that can allow your prank to reach any of your coworkers equally these pranks are harmless enough that they ll get laughs without causing any actual damage to the office equipment just make sure your coworkers would find these pranks funny before you pull them off print out an official looking memo that says the office equipment has been upgraded to have voice activated technology then watch as coworkers try to talk and eventually yell at the printer or copy machine 20 x research source you can also tape a funny photograph under the cover of a scanner or copy machine when your coworkers open the lid to use the equipment they ll be in for a humorous surprise 21 x research source you can also run a job that uses all the paper in the printer but that may

how to celebrate hobbit day,september 22 is the birthday of the famous hobbits bilbo and frodo baggins in recognition of these endearing characters created by j r r tolkien this date has come to be known as hobbit day so that fans of hobbits everywhere can pause and celebrate the delight that is a hobbit so if you re one of those very people who wants to take one day this year to honor the fine race of hobbits here are some ideas to help you celebrate,plan a long expected party with fellow hobbit fans this refers to the chapter one of the fellowship of the ring in the book this party involves bilbo baggins birthday his departure and gandalf farewelling frodo baggins in your case it is just a great excuse to have a party some of the things to set the scene might include decorating with a pile of packages to represent the wagon that is laden with packages in the story as well as piles of presents fireworks or at least sparklers it s not likely you can recreate one in the image of a dragon but at least consider having a flag or a poster with a dragon on it lanterns for lighting would be reminiscent of the book have dancing music songs and games decide where to hold the party if you have a large tree in your backyard or in a nearby park consider making it the party tree an outdoor hobbit party is probably more in keeping with the tradition of big hobbit events than trying to cram everyone indoors but obviously this will depend on where you live and the weather the benefit of being outdoors is the juvenile hobbits can run around without feeling cooped up and all crumbs can be eaten by the creatures of the earth without the need to vacuum up if you decide to hold the party in a house put up pictures or decorations with a hobbit theme there are plenty of images that you can print out from online images to use in your private home environment and you can embellish these with computer photo programs if needed make sure that your festivities include a good amount of food either a large meal or various snack foods hobbits were known for their many well stocked pantries as was made known on the first page of the hobbit food that might be perfect for a hobbit celebration includes unsurprisingly much of it seems like traditional english fare mushrooms these are favorite hobbit food and farmer maggot used to grow them and frodo got caught trying to steal some wine bilbo and frodo both inherited vineyards beer is also popular with hobbits hot soup cold meats mince pies pork pies rabbit fish and chips rashers of bacon blackberry tarts and other blackberry foods including uncooked blackberries freshly baked bread and lots of butter pickles are often mentioned ripe cheese food made from vegetables such as corn turnips carrots potatoes and onions food made with apples such as apple tart with raspberry jam honey foods made with honey such as honey cakes would be nice scones known as biscuits in north america fruit pies and cakes including seed cakes pinwheel sandwiches just because these are small and cute and the hobbits may have approved provided they weren t too fussy tea and coffee keep seasonings and sauces to a minimum apparently hobbits didn t bother with them that much choose a passage or more about hobbits from one of tolkien s books to read aloud together this is important for both fans and non initiates alike the fans will know the passages and the non initiate will be introduced to the way of hobbits through listening ask someone with an excellent projecting voice who enjoys reading in public to read out the passages so it s enjoyable for everyone play games hobbits loved games so a party celebrating hobbits needs to have plenty of these going you could start by putting a hobbit name on each guest s back and making people figure out who they are just by asking questions of other guests no peeking other games to consider include and each of these can be made suitable for any age with an imagination backyard party games like quoits horseshoe tossing beanbag throwing sack jumping egg and spoon race three legged race coconut shy etc indoor games like musical chairs pass the parcel the chocolate game pin the tail on the donkey statues chinese whispers etc play rhyming games and making up haiku poems limericks etc play games that involve riddles charades sayings or proverbs have a special cake as well as all the other scrumptious food don t forget that hobbit day is also a birthday party for bilbo and frodo make or purchase a special birthday cake with two candles one for each hobbit for fun you might toast the bagginses and make little speeches in their honor give away lovely things to everyone who comes to the party small but creative gifts such as toys jewelry trinkets small musical instruments puzzles etc should be given to the guests this represents one of the peaceful pursuits of hobbits gift giving and is the spirit of sharing and creating community both valued by hobbits see how to make a birthday goodie bag for adults how to put together a goodie bag how to sew a cloth gift bag and how to make gift bags for more ideas if you do not think your friends would be very interested in a hobbit day celebration celebrate the day in your own way walk around barefoot for the day eat about six meals hobbits are always hungry or make a hobbit day t shirt to spread awareness consider making flyers to share with friends and acquaintances to help them understand the importance of this day,Holidays-and-Traditions

week before it ll make the food on turkey day that much more delicious we re not advocating dieting per se what we are saying is skip the dessert don t spent the afternoon baking or let your froyo coupon expire when you go out for a meal box up half before you even begin make little strides you wouldn t otherwise make thanksgiving isn t about losing weight it s about not gaining it put treats out of sight when our kitchens dining rooms living rooms and let s be honest bedrooms are littered with cakes cookies and sweet sweet munchies it d take a robot not to succumb to the deliciousness when peppermint brownies gingerbread and toffee is within arm s reach no one is going to blame you for going over to the dark side since it d be ridiculous to suggest you throw them out the best thing you can do is to put them in a non transparent container and in the cupboard out of sight out of mind it actually works when we re staring at a table full of treats all hope goes out the window but when they re there but not seen we re capable of forgetting that they re there most of the time and thus can avoid the absent minded munchie grab do yourself a favor and pack em away before you don t realize you re on your fifth mint chocolate cupcake schedule your workouts when our schedules get jam packed which normally happens during the holidays exercise is usually the first to go the gym changes hours we end up traveling family obligations magnify tenfold whatever the cause we succumb to the demands of our schedules and end up doing a lot more sitting waiting and eating than we intended instead of letting your schedule rule you rule it call up your gym and find out their new hours wake up 30 minutes earlier to squeeze in a 20 minute morning workout only do your holiday shopping after you ve had a session with the treadmill when you make it a priority it s a lot easier to stick to reduce stress most of us are running around like chickens with our heads cut off this time of year the increase in our stress levels actually leads to more cortisol being produced which can lead to weight gain 1 x research source and you thought it was only the dinner rolls take some time to do some warm ups and stretching in the morning or squeeze in a yoga session whenever possible take 10 minutes of me time when you re sitting at your desk at work whatever would give you that

workouts jumping jacks planks squats etc can be done in your hotel room boyfriend s uncle s spare bedroom do it with family start a routine of taking an early evening walk weather permitting even running around the house can get everyone going sign up for a turkey trot your area may have a 5k 10k or fun run available on the morning of thanksgiving and proceeds may even go to charity what a great way to start off giving thanks right away and the right way keep warm when our bodies get cold all we want to do is huddle up in the corner under a blanket rocking ourselves until the freeze passes maybe grabbing a hot toddy or two to avoid this physical stagnation keep warm turn the heat up in the house throw on an extra sweater but above all keep moving and you know what moving does burns calories when our muscles stay warm and relaxed it s a lot easier to opt for that workout so run around your house a bit every so often that evening workout may not seem so totally not doable

dietary restrictions it can also be potluck style that way you have a few options that you ve pre approved yourself don t forget the table if you didn t already know wikihow has tons of thanksgiving articles to get you through your hosting duties revamp your traditional favorites pick natural unprocessed foods prepared simply but tastily with herbs spices and fruits such as lemon and orange throw

rolls for your mashed potatoes make 25 of it cauliflower don t tell anyone and see if they even notice stick to healthier oils like olive canola or walnut if you re seasoning your veggies try to lay off the salt it s the culprit behind bloating plan healthier snacks even though we re fully aware of thanksgiving being the absolute biggest meal of the year save maybe christmas that doesn t keep us from snacking the day away as we wait for the turkey to bing in the oven instead of munching on cakes and cookies opt for a veggie tray fruits and light cheeses since the cookies are in the cupboard right you won t be tempted to go for them anyway of course if you can stay away from the finger foods entirely that s best but c mon this is thanksgiving we re talking about here will power and self control is for holiday grinches choose healthier desserts sure pumpkin pie is a given luckily it s a lot healthier than pecan pie and if you don t eat the crust it s even better but that doesn t have to be your only option stuffed apples or pears really any fruit without a crust is a great holiday dessert too and much lighter in calories take this day as an excuse to widen your dessert repertoire never checked out wikihow s desserts and sweets section there are gems like how to create healthy desserts for your family how to make parfaits how to make butterbeer and even how to make caramel coated cheetos make edible gllitter and how to make desserts with ramen noodles think of all the desserts you ve never tried plan your meal for 1 2 pm urge that schedule if you can influence the time set for the meal that way no appetizers are needed at all as you are sitting down to eat early also the earlier start time gives you time for digestion key to feeling good the next day and for more activity in your day after the meal is finished if you are active after the meal it will help you manage physically and feel much better grandma was right have the beautiful meal on the table at 1 or 2 it works better for the cook tablesetter clean up persons as well then you aren t too exhausted to enjoy yourself and you definitely need time before dessert which you want to savor and not force down by the way eat a decent breakfast you basically have two options here 1 eat a decent protein rich breakfast followed by a large thanksgiving meal or 2 skip breakfast start starving and eat a thanksgiving meal that s so large you resort to rolling yourself to the couch and asking mom to bring you more pie because you can t move which one sounds like the more weight friendly option hopefully you re thinking 1 it s not exactly rocket science going into a meal not starving makes us eat a lot less when we hit the dinner table sure you re wasting calories on food you eat every day but you re preventing yourself from gorging on a 3 500 calorie meal and no it won t result in a higher calorie intake you will eat less if you eat breakfast be an active host if you did get lucky enough to secure hosting duties good for you now you can run around entertaining people filling up their drinks making sure all is good to go and decorating sounds like work sure but it ll keep you moving around if fidgeters are thinner this is definitely an idea worth taking advantage of 2 x research source don t think of this as ruining your thanksgiving no no no you re actually more involved at the end of the day you ll feel more like you created it rather than being a passive participant and maybe your friends and family will be thankful for you this year imagine that wear a tight fitting outfit this one barely needs reiteration if your pants are so tight eating is uncomfortable you ll do a lot less of it at the very least you ll be conscious of what s going on in your body and feel less free to begin your self induced food coma use portion control take tablespoon size servings of only the various dishes you really want leave behind anything you feel lukewarm about take bites of what you like the very best first when you clear your small plate you ll know exactly what you want to zero in on for seconds it s all about tactical planning you can eat anything if you only eat a small amount so don t tell yourself certain foods are off limits that just paves the way for intense cravings and falling off the wagon later eat a little bit to satisfy your hunger eat the turkey the healthy way when it comes to the big bird it should be baked or roasted definitely not fried if you can push for either of those two options do so and when it hits the table opt for white meat that is without skin the skin is the fattiest bit if your family is big into gravy made with drippings chill it first for about 15 minutes that will separate the fat leaving a film on the top that you can scrape off if anyone asks tell them you read the pilgrims did it and are trying to be authentic mind your margaritas that alcohol you re drinking be it eggnog god forbid manhattans or red wine is full of empty calories you can drink and drink and drink and your body has no idea it s ingesting calories because it just isn t full go with water club soda with lime or a cup of mint tea you will feel so much better be more present and survive the season with less weight left on your booty and more tread left on your tires if you do imbibe try alternating each alcoholic drink with a hydration cycle of some kind water with lemon diet soda perrier etc or take that glass of wine and turn it into a spritzer with bubbly 0 calorie water you want to remember the day right slow down enjoy and be thankful for each bite truly savoring the wonderful tastes the slower you eat the less you ll intake before your stomach reaches your brain and says woah stop i m full it usually takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to start sending cck signals to your brain the i m full hormone so instead of gorging yourself before you realize you don t want any more take it easy you have the whole afternoon after all a simple way to do this is to put your fork down between bites chewing your food a little more than you normally would no need for counting and ruining thanksgiving with math and losing the fork are two concrete ways to curb your chowing speed don t fall prey to now or never thinking you re allowed to roast a turkey or turkey breast make a pumpkin pie or recreate aunt sue s special stuffing in july if you want to ditch the one time only availability theory which causes gobbling of thanksgiving foods this mindset and focus will make turning down extra holiday servings a lot easier the food is not the key thing to thanksgiving otherwise it d be called food eating and the food is not going to run away there will be leftovers for later or tomorrow sit back and visit or be the person to initiate a what i am thankful for this year conversation keep your focus eat what you really enjoy and then stop avoid hitting the couch right after the meal find an activity outlet afterward crank up 70 s disco hits and dance while helping clean up the meal and kitchen take a long walk with family and friends to enjoy town and or enjoy the fall color play tag outside with the kids you get the idea just get moving afterward you totally won t want to however your evolved self can say no to those tryptophan receptors and push through it frisbee in the park anyone remember thanksgiving day is just one day if you blow it get right back up on the horse and ride it s making excuses and rationalizations every single day afterward in the 40 days between thanksgiving and new year s that will cause you to gain the typical 3 7 holiday pounds with the right mindset your new year s resolution can be something actually useful and unique above all do not let yourself just say what the heck it s thanksgiving or december christmas or new year s and run wild holiday foods can be made anytime of year don t be caught up in how special they are be picky and really enjoy what you

prank in their home or work as they are most comfortable there if you ask them to meet you somewhere or come outside for example they may become suspicious try early in the morning by mid morning everyone has had a chance to realize it is april 1 so they are are on their guard however if you start early you re more likely to catch people unawares especially before they ve had their morning coffee 2 x research source keep it lighthearted fooling someone is one thing but they should be able to laugh at the joke when it s revealed silly and fun works much better than serious and threatening you don t want an april fool s joke to cost you a relationship a job or even worse land you in jail 3 x research source for instance filling a room with balloons is silly making someone trip when they walk in the room could be more serious especially if it leads to injury try bedtime pranks one good easy prank is to put something under a person s pillow messy substances work best for this prank such as marshmallow cream or shaving cream when the person gets ready to go to sleep they ll stick their hands under the pillow and find a silly surprise create alarm clock fun alarm clocks are often used to prank people because you can set them to go off at a later time one way to use alarm clocks is to gather a bunch of them and hide them around someone s room set them to go off at different times during the night 4 x research source another option that takes more commitment is to make someone early for something for instance if your spouse gets up before dawn to go to work you can set all the clocks and smartphones in the house to several hours earlier when your spouse gets up at his or her normal time it will actually be hours earlier fake destroying important documents secretly make a copy of documents important to a friend or coworker hide the original away in front of the person accidentally spill coffee on it 5 x research source this prank works especially well if it s something that s not easily reproduced such as a birth certificate car title or something that was notarized it also works well to play it on a friend who doesn t have easy access to a printer and who has printed off a paper for class already cover a car in sticky notes this prank takes some time and commitment but the shock value is worth it simply buy a bunch of sticky notes and cover the entire car with them the driver will have to remove them before he or she can leave 6 x research source it s maybe best not to play this prank when it will make someone late to work school or another commitment it can take a while to remove all of the sticky notes so allow ample time wrap a phone in rubber bands this prank is a good one for the office simply use rubber bands large enough to wrap around the person s office phone then completely wrap the phone in rubber bands when they go to use the phone they ll have to unwrap it first 7 x research source remember that you re taking a chance anytime you pull a prank at the office you re cutting down on productivity and your boss may not be okay with that make sure you are willing to accept the consequences before you pull an office prank grow a garden in a keyboard one way to prank coworkers is to grow gardens in keyboards and switch them out for the working keyboards when your coworkers come in you ll definitely get a laugh 8 x research source start with an old broken keyboard add water soil and chia or grass seeds enclose it in a clear plastic bag loosely to create a greenhouse and set it in a sunny spot check on the soil every day to make sure it stays moist let it grow for about a week set the garden keyboard on the desk and hide the person s regular keyboard it is not a good idea to do this prank on a working office keyboard that is destruction of company property and you could easily be fired for that even if you re not using company property consider your office atmosphere and the temperament of your boss before pulling this prank make mayo donuts buy a box of glazed donuts on top of them spread or pipe mayonnaise to look like frosting your unsuspecting coworkers will get a mouthful of mayonnaise when they re expecting sweet frosting 9 x research source this prank could backfire if someone has a food allergy or is vegan or vegetarian just be sure you take that into consideration before attempting it freeze their computers one way to prank coworkers is to take a screenshot of their computer screens then you replace their background with that screenshot once you hide the icons it will look like their regular screen but they won t be able to click on anything 10 x research source start by hitting print screen on their keyboard paste it into a program like paint save it as an image next replace the background image with your image you can usually do this step by right clicking on the screen and hitting personalize or preferences on the menu hide the icons the easiest way to hide the icons is to right click on the desktop then move to view next uncheck the box for show desktop icons check this box again when you want them to reappear 11 x research source once again this prank will cut down on productivity so make sure you re okay with the consequences if your boss isn t happy don t use a prank to isolate and humiliate someone in some settings such as the office pranks are often played on either the top performer or the under performer in other words the prank is often played on someone that others would like to see humbled a bit in that case the prank can go pretty wrong considering that the person you re pranking could end up feeling victimized leading to poor office morale or even consequences for you 12 x research source also it s never a good idea to prank the boss unless she or he has created an atmosphere where everyone gets pranked now and then stick to people who can take the joke or even unilaterally play it on everyone another option is just sticking to friends and loved ones who know you care about them skip the scare tactics simply jumping out at someone may not be so bad but pulling elaborate pranks that fake someone s death are much less appropriate for instance if your girlfriend faked her death how would that make you feel most people are left feeling hurt and vulnerable even after the prank has been revealed so it s a good idea to skip these types of pranks 13 x research source avoid good news pranks that is don t tell someone they ve won a car for example it gets their hopes up and then you just have to dash them later this type of prank can turn cruel very quickly 14 x research source this step is even more true when it s more personal for instance telling someone their song is going to be played on the radio can raise false hopes that will leave the person feeling very disappointed don t do anything dangerous hitting someone in the face with a cream pie isn t dangerous digging a hole for someone to fall in is dangerous you don t want to cause harm to another person especially since you could be liable for any hospital bills or even face criminal charges 15 x research source skip anything illegal it can be easy to tip into illegal activities when pulling a prank moving someone s car permanently damaging property or even tripping someone could all be construed as illegal if things go wrong think about the possible consequences of your prank before you pull it off 16 x research source,Holidays-and-Traditions

how to give gifts unconditionally,giving gifts unconditionally is not necessarily simple gift giving can sometimes feel like a chore that makes us resentful other times we give gifts in order to get something in return even if it is simply the gratitude from the recipient seen in this light we are really giving to get what daniel goleman terms a narcissistic hit something that isn t exactly motivated by altruism how can we learn to give gifts without strings attached when we are accustomed to feeling either a sense of duty or we want gratitude from others in return unconditional gift giving starts by sharing a piece of yourself your love or esteem and care for the other person shown by the time taken to select a gift in a considerate manner and combining this with not wanting anything at all in return,find a gift that means something about the other person to you be proud of what you choose don t just buy something because it is in the bargain bin or because it was the most expensive item in the store put effort care and consideration into the purchase or creation of the gift making the gift yourself is definitely an option too and is even more a piece of you so feel free to do so let it be a surprise a gift prompted by persistent requests for it is not as exciting or fulfilling as a gift that is a total surprise this does not mean that you cannot give things sorely needed by the recipient but how you will know this is by observing their life and knowing them rather than heeding direct requests for items think beyond stuff stuff is all very nice and cute when wrapped up but stuff ends up drowning us sometimes giving stuff is giving a burden to another person and the condition involved in such a gift is that the recipient puts up with shelving your stuff in their already over crowded life if you are gifting the person who has everything avoid stuff consider alternatives that won t oblige the condition of adding to clutter on the recipient gifts such as a promise to visit monthly to take an elderly recipient to art galleries or botanical gardens a service nappy diaper washing service house cleaning service car wash etc plants for the garden that will produce food scent colour or shade a voucher for a massage spa treatment fitness class think carefully about what the other person would not buy for themselves if you give items that a person is already very adept at getting for themselves muzzling in on this territory can be a means of invading it and substituting their sense of style with yours don t even bother if you know the person well you will know already what they do well enough without your help look instead for the things they d never consider purchasing like the red shoes with really high heels you overheard them pondering about but muttered that they couldn t afford a trip to a spa resort that they would never think to slow down for normally or a new food that is something they ve never tried before etc let the recipient know gently and without great hoo ha that your gift can be returned to a store re gifted or donated if it doesn t make them feel comfortable or happy you do not want to create a noose around their necks if you ever had an experience growing up when someone in your family gave your family something hideous and it was ferreted out each time this person visited you will know that the sense of obligation can turn gift receiving into a burden rather than a delight avoid giving useful items that the whole household needs and will make use of the toaster for mother on mother s day the car cleaning gear for dad these things do service for everyone and are not gifts in the usual sense an exception would be if you give something like the car cleaning gear include with it coupons the recipient can cash in to you to wash and wax the car for them otherwise if you must produce such items as gifts gift them to the house the car or the family as a whole these sorts of items are just too impersonal to be true gifts and this makes them conditional you are giving something provided that everyone else gets to use it expect nothing in return you are giving because you want to if you don t want to then you need to reassess the point of what it is that you are really doing do not expect gratitude smiles or something in return although most respectful and well mannered people will demonstrate gratitude there are times where this will not be forthcoming for one reason or other but that does not necessarily mean that the person doesn t respect your gift giving or not appreciate it sometimes people are embarrassed too surprised shy ashamed or self conscious to react in a gracious manner if you have given with good heart their reaction or lack of one should not bother you look deeper and you will see truly how the gift has been received be considerate about presentation wrapping and presenting the gift will show your sense of style and also that you have taken care to present your gift nicely a demonstration of respect for the recipient it doesn t have to be complex and recyclability is de rigueur,Holidays-and-Traditions

miles 5 05 km which is just a tiny bit longer than a 5k you can take this a step further by organizing a pi mile run with friends or colleagues lay down in pi formation and take a picture if you re

note that there is some debate regarding the exact time that pi day should be celebrated though 1 59pm is probably the most common some believe that the 24 hour clock should be used instead which would mean that pi day should be celebrated at 1 59am or 15 09pm convert things into pi this step is absolutely necessary for two reasons first to utterly confuse people who have no idea what you re talking about and secondly to have fun seeing how many things can be referenced with pi this will help you reach an even higher appreciation for the amazing number that is pi consider two approaches use pi to tell the time convert naturally circular things into radians like the hours on the clock instead of it being 3 o clock now it s 1 2 pi o clock or instead of it being 3 o clock convert the inclination of the sun into radians and describe that as the time simply use 3 14 as a unit of measure instead of being 31 years old you are 9pi years old with this same approach you can find out your next pi birthday just don t forget to celebrate it when it comes help the tradition continue don t let this be a one time thing you owe it to pi to celebrate again and again set the date for next year and consider creating a pi club or website in the process talk about your plans for pi day the following year this will help generate enthusiasm take notes after your pi day celebration what can you do next year to make your celebration even more incredible next year talk about the day months in advance so your skeptical friends can be convinced to join in you can even advertise for the event by

the first two days of the holiday are especially blessed on these days much like on shabbat most forms of work are to be avoided as a show of reverence to god specifically all activities normally forbidden on shabbat are also forbidden on the first two days of sukkot with the exception of cooking baking transferring fire and carrying things around 3 x research source during this time people

most important holiday tradition for sukkot on the first day of sukkot the observers of the holiday ritually wave a collection of branches including the lulav and the etrog in all directions a lulav is a bouquet made from a single palm leaf two willow branches and three myrtle branches held together by woven leaves an etrog is a citron a lemon like fruit grown in israel the etrog must have the stigma stem to make it kosher to perform the ritual hold the lulav in your right hand and the etrog in your left say a bracha blessing over them then shake them in the six directions north south east west up and down symbolizing god s presence everywhere 9 x research source note that different religious commentators give different instructions for the order of directions the lulav and etrog should be shaken in 10 x research source to most the precise order isn t important enjoy plenty of other sukkot traditions building the sukkah and performing the branch waving ritual are undoubtedly the two most important well known sukkot traditions but they re far from the only ones sukkot is a holiday with many traditions too many to list here these often vary from family to family and locale to locale so feel free to research the sukkot traditions of the world as you re planning your holiday below are just a few ideas you might want to consider for your sukkot celebration spend time eating meals and camping out in the sukkah tell stories from scripture especially those from the 40 years the israelites spent in the desert participate in sukkah song and dance many religious songs are made just for sukkot 11 x research source invite your family to join your sukkot celebration use walls that can stand up to the wind the sukkah which is the definitive sukkot tradition is quite simple to build the four sided booth must have at least three walls while the fourth wall can be used as a door one of the walls can be low or removable to allow passage into and out of the sukkah the material used to build the sukkah can vary but because the sukkah will only remain standing for seven days a light material probably makes most sense the only traditional requirements for the walls are that they be able to stand up in the wind with this definition even canvas stretched across a hard frame is suitable in terms of size you ll want your walls at least far enough apart that you ll have room to eat in the sukkah depending on the size of your family this can cause the size of your sukkah to vary greatly add a roof made from plant matter traditionally the roofs of sukkah are made from plant matter like branches leaves twigs and so on these materials can be purchased or taken from nature 12 x research source according to tradition the roof of a sukkah should be thick enough to provide shade and shelter during the day but you should still be able to see stars through it at night 13 x research source making a roof from plant material is a way of giving remembrance to the israelites who wandered in the desert for 40 years after leaving egypt during their travels they had to live in temporary dwellings similar to the sukkah using whatever materials were available to them for shelter decorate your sukkah decorating the sukkah is seen as a commendable show of sukkot observance traditional decorations include harvest vegetables corn pumpkins and squash hung from the ceiling and beams or placed in corners other decorations include but are not limited to paper chains pipecleaner constructions religious pictures or drawings wax paper stained glass or anything else that you or your children feel like creating children usually love to help decorate the sukkah giving your children a chance to draw on the walls of the sukkah and gather vegetables for display is a great way to get them involved in the holiday from an early age alternatively buy a ready made sukkah from the sukkot project at www sukkot com if you re in a rush or you don t have the materials necessary to buy your sukkah don t worry these kits allow you to set up your own sukkah without having to prepare any of the materials yourself saving you lots of time as an added bonus these kits can usually be

from about 50 00 120 00 leave your sukkah up until the end of simchat torah the sukkah traditionally stays up throughout the sukkot holiday serving as a place to gather eat and pray for all seven days immediately after sukkot 2 holy days shemini atzeret and simchat torah though they re not part of the sukkot holiday they are closely associated with it so the sukkah isn t traditionally disassembled until after simchat torah it s perfectly acceptable to save your disassembled sukkah materials so that you can use them to build another sukkah next year read the torah to find the sources of sukkot traditions though sukkot has its origins as an ancient agricultural harvest festival the modern religious version of the festival is derived from the hebrew scriptures according to the torah god spoke to moses while he was leading the israelites through the desert and instructed him on the proper traditions of the sukkot holiday reading this original account of the source of sukkot traditions can help imbue the holiday with divine meaning especially for someone who s a new practitioner most of the scriptural description of sukkot comes in the book of leviticus specifically leviticus 23 33 43 offer an account of the meeting between god and moses during which the sukkot holiday is discussed 14 x research source attend sukkot services at your synagogue sukkot is most famously associated with traditions like the construction of a sukkah that take place with one s family however entire jewish communities are also encouraged to come together in celebration of sukkot at synagogue services at traditional morning sukkot services the congregation joins in amidah prayer followed by hallel as would normally occur for sukkot after this the congregation recites special hoshana rabbah psalms asking for god s forgiveness 15 x research source scriptural readings during sukkot traditionally come from the book of ecclesiastes talk to your rabbi about celebrating sukkot if you have questions about sukkot or any of the traditions associated with it try talking to your rabbi he or she will be more than happy to discuss the religious and cultural sources of sukkot tradition and instruct you in proper observance of the holiday keep in mind that sukkot traditions can vary from community to community for instance among non observant jews it s not uncommon for someone to not even know yow to celebrate sukkot while for traditional or highly orthodox jews the holiday can be a major yearly event read contemporary sukkot commentary not everything that s ever been written about sukkot comes from ancient scripture or religious texts much has been written about sukkot over the years by rabbis religious scholars and even laypeople many essays and opinion pieces centered on sukkot have even been produced in the modern era most modern sukkot commentary will be relatively easy to read and approachable compared to older writings so feel free to look up sukkot essays at www chabad org the

will see your opportunities and things to be grateful about rather than dwelling on things that happen that work against us be bold people who feel lucky put themselves in situations which face the possibility of failure it takes courage and a positive attitude that accepts failure as a momentary setback instead of wasting time coming up with reasons to avoid tough situations or challenging scenarios people who feel luck come up with reasons to act to confront and to succeed being bold does not mean reckless put your faith in luck but there is a reason for seat belts in vehicles an old saying goes going into a situation expecting to fail is the best way to ensure failure the unlucky are often experts in making themselves comfortable and safe but achieve little put yourself out there

take good fortunate and turn it into more good fortune in the newspaper experiment wiseman conducted the only difference between the lucky and the unlucky was that the lucky people kept an eye out for advantage fortune and luck and the unlucky given the exact same advantage missed it take control of situations francis ford coppola award winning filmmaker of apocalypse now and the godfather is famous for his unusual ways of making movies which isn t really very strange at all when he wants to make a movie he just starts making a movie no script actors or studio support doesn t matter he s got an idea and doesn t let anyone get in his way respect yourself enough to give your wants and your desires precedence over other concerns don t say i wonder if i ll be allowed to do this but say who s going to stop me giving yourself the responsibility to succeed gives you the ability to succeed give yourself the position of control not other people who are supposedly keeping you from getting what you want don t wait around for permission to do things take what you want at work don t write up a project proposal for approval just do your project and show off the results don t wait to get an outline of your book put together so you can get an advance from a publisher and write it just start writing it stop thinking and start feeling lucky people have learned to respect their intuitions hunches and gut instincts if you ve got a tendency to overanalyze situations and find reasons to feel slighted offended or unlucky learn to listen to your gut instead try this experiment next time you ve got to make an important decision let yourself make it instantaneously go with your fastest gut reaction and don t give yourself the chance to rethink it it just occurred to you that you re not in love with your partner break up now you just got the urge to quit your job and volunteer on an organic grape vineyard for a couple months put in your papers make it happen work hard coppola still had to make those movies he blundered into that meant hundreds of hours of dull slogging through the jungle in vietnam and early mornings dealing with marlon brando s weirdness and hundreds of reels of film to edit but he threw himself into it sow the seeds of luck with labor work hard hard workers open up opportunities and advantages because their results are that much better than everyone else s if you re working twice as hard at work your work will be twice as good and you ll feel twice as lucky for having done it try to focus on doing one thing at a time and doing it extremely well on monday don t worry about everything you ve got to do for the rest of the week try not to even think about what you ve got to do in the afternoon just think about this moment right now and finishing what you ve started expect luck the reason luck happens to the lucky is that lucky people go into a situation expecting success and expecting a lucky outcome it s just like grandma always used to say if you think it s going to be boring it will be if you go into work expecting a rough day chances are it s going to be a rough day if you go into an experience expecting that you re going to have an opportunity for success you re going to make it happen expecting a lucky outcome will make you more aware of advantages and opportunities like the lucky people looking through the paper you ll be more aware and on the lookout for that little thing that s going to get you ahead of the game rather than giving up prematurely because you feel unlucky list your accomplishments daily at the end of each day reflect back on what you ve accomplished each thing ticked off your to do list each goal finished for the day should be celebrated with a mental note and a reward don t think about things you wish you would have done or the things you d liked to have made time for think about what you actually did focus hard on your accomplishments and celebrate them list big accomplishments and small ones cleaning up the kitchen without a fuss that s an accomplishment getting out of bed and riding the bus to work huge deal feel lucky about it celebrate little wins and big wins alike take a little time out of each day to celebrate the things you ve accomplished it doesn t have to be a blowout party with champagne and cake but some quiet reflection over new accomplishments and old successes is very important to help you feel lucky learning to look back over each day to examine your accomplishments will also help you to move forward and set yourself up for more accomplishments get addicted to that pleased feeling of having done something productive today make sure your celebrations aren t counterproductive celebrating a hard day at the office with a long night at the bar won t make tomorrow very easy on you stop comparing yourself to others we tend to compare ourselves to people in our social circles siblings facebook friends or high school classmates all too often we may not feel we measure up but the only person you have got to please with your accomplishment is yourself feeling that you do not compare with others make you feel that you are somehow unfortunate too social networking can be a real downer people tend to post the good things and not mention the ordinary or the bad as much as a result you may see your ex roommate s awesome photos of his trip to puerto rico and feel jealous but you may not hear about how he fought with his wife the whole trip remember your qualities if you compare yourself to others maybe you do envy your friend s artwork however you are the person she comes to when she needs her computer fixed a practical skill that she lacks that is every bit as admirable as artistic ability try to be more outgoing learning to put yourself out there can help you make connections and feel fortuitous and fortunate expect that every interaction you have with a stranger even five minutes on the subway could be life changing and critical maybe the bored guy chatting with you at the post office might be a like minded musician you could start a band with maybe the cute barista is the one don t let opportunities pass you by be more flexible having plans is a good way to feel unlucky and disappointed no one will feel lucky all the time or experience good fortune every day but learning to roll with the punches and be at least a little flexible will help you to get the best out of those situations that don t go the way you want try to stay focused on the bigger picture if your peaceful sunday at home a day you wanted to devote to cleaning or spending with your partner has been interrupted by your friend needed a ride to the airport don t overreact celebrate the chance you ll get to hang out with your friend before a trip go into with positive energy supplement your hard work with lucky charms while it may seem superstitious to some it s true that adorning yourself with lucky totems or keeping an eye out for lucky signs can help

research source purchase the person 2 hours of cleaning services from a local cleaning company make the person a week s worth of freezer meals that they can heat and eat when they are short on time offer to run errands for the person babysit or walk the person s dog get them what they asked for if they made a request some people are very straightforward and will tell you without hesitation what they want if the person has told you already that they want a specific gift don t overthink things and try to get them something else get them what they asked for since it is something they will use and that they obviously want 13 x research source for example if the person told you they really want a new toaster because their toaster is broken then get them a new toaster if they said they only want gift cards to buy video games give them a gift card to a video game store or to download games on a device donate to charity on your own behalf not as a gift do not make a charitable donation in the person s name it may seem like this is something they would appreciate and some people might however most people are less satisfied with this type of gift than with something they could actually use 14 x research source if the person requests donations on their behalf then that is what you should get them however be careful about assuming this is something they would like don t be afraid to give more than 1 person the same gift many people feel the need to get a different gift for each person on their list this can be challenging and it s not necessary if you have multiple people to buy for and you find something that you think more than 1 of them would like buy the same gift for all of them 15 x research source for example if you have 3 friends on your list and you find a really cool looking lamp that you think they d all enjoy buy 3 of those lamps and give 1 to each of your friends pool your money with friends or family if the gift is beyond your means there s nothing wrong with going in on a large gift with a group of friends or family if you cannot afford to get someone something they really want or need try talking to your friends a few weeks in advance to see if they might want to do a group gift 16 x research source for example if you have a friend who recently lost their cell phone and cannot afford a new one then you and a few friends could pool your money and buy them a new phone if your parent is in need of a new tv then you and your siblings could share the cost of a new one for them,Holidays-and-Traditions

bracelet you can make wish bone shaped charms to add to the bracelet,gather your materials to start you ll need to gather your materials most of what you need for a conventional wish bracelet can be found at a local craft store you will need the following 1 x research source hemp twine size 6 0 seed beads scissors a clipboard or tape which you ll use to pin down the twine as you braid cut three pieces of hemp based on wrist or ankle size to start your bracelet you ll need to cut your hemp cut the hemp in a length big enough that the bracelet will fit around your wrist or ankle do not just measure the diameter of your wrist or ankle however as you ll be braiding the hemp which will reduce its length about 15 inches will work for most wrist sizes although you may need slightly more or less if your wrist is larger is smaller when making bracelets for children you will probably need less than 15 inches 2 x research source an ankle bracelet will be larger so you may need more hemp for an ankle bracelet 20 to 24 inches may be necessary tie the hemp strands together in an overhand knot on one end to start you ll want to tie your strands of hemp together in an overhand knot you ll want to leave about 2 inches of slack as you ll have to tie the bracelet together when you re done 3 x research source an overhand knot is fairly simple it s more or less a basic knot cross the end of the hemp over the rest of the hemp making a q shape 4 x research source tuck the tail of the hemp through the q shaped loop then pull at both ends until the knot is sufficiently tight braid the hemp down about 2 and a half inches from here you can begin braiding the three strands of hemp together to secure the hemp tuck the tied end under the clip on your clipboard if you re not using a clipboard use a small piece of scotch tape to secure the tied end on a flat surface then simply braid the ends together for about 2 and a half inches 5 x research source keep in mind 2 and a half inches will result in about a 7 inch bracelet if you want your bracelet to be longer or shorter than this braid down slightly more or less thread a bead onto the right hand strand and braid into the bracelet once

until it s pressed against the end of the braid 6 x research source once the bead is near the edge of the braid braid the strands as you normally would you will end up braiding the bead into the center of the stands when you re done braiding the bead should be closed into the braid with twine repeat the process with the new right hand strand once you ve added one bead take the new righthand strand thread a new bead onto this strand and then braid the bead into the bracelet you should now have two beads that are braided into the center of the hemp strands 7 x research source add as many beads as you want continue this process until you ve added as many beads as you want keep adding beads to the new righthand strand then braiding them into the center of the bracelet 8 x research source for a wish bracelet some advocate adding 7 beads as 7 is thought to be a lucky number however there is no set number add as many beads as you want for your bracelet braid down another few inches when you finish adding beads once you ve finished adding beads continue braiding the hemp strands together you should keep braiding until you re about two inches away from the end of the strands 9 x research source do another overhand knot once you reach the end of the strand tie another overhand knot remember you cross the end of the hemp over the rest of the hemp forming a q shape pass the end of the hemp through the loop made by the q shape and pull until tight tie the bracelet around your wrist and make a wish your wish bracelet is now complete wrap the bracelet around your wrist and tie the two ends together make a wish as you do so superstition dictates that once all the beads fall off your wish will come true 10 x research source gather your materials a fun alteration

need about 30 millimeters or 3 centimeters of wire for each charm you should be able to cut the charm with a thick pair of scissors use your pliers to make and then twist a loop in the wire from here use your round nose pliers make a loop with the wires by twisting one end over the other and then pulling downward the loop itself should be small with two long strands of wire hanging off either end remember you re trying to create something like a wishbone so keep this image in mind to gauge loop size to make the loop look more like a wishbone take your chain nose pliers twist the loop about 1 4 of the way around the loop will now be sideways with the strands hanging off on either side use the oval pliers to curve the sides you want to curve either side of the loop now this will make it look more like a wishbone take your oval pliers and use them to gently curve either side of the loop inward it can help to look at a picture of a wishbone online to figure out how much of a curve you want the sides should be bent in slightly but not curved to the point they re almost touching braid into your wish bracelet you can braid your wishbone charm into your bracelet as you would braid in the

might feel in the moment if this is for christmas or another mutual gift giving holiday this may also cause them to reevaluate what they are giving to you which is only fair 2 x research source you can say have you ever heard of people giving donations in someone s name instead of physical gifts i think that s pretty cool we all have way too much stuff anyway make it personal you want the recipient to have an emotional connection with this gift as such select a charity that will be meaningful to them by donating to charity that they believe in the large scale generosity of the gift will be clear what s more the personalized nature of the gift will show that you put thoughts into it this will make it much easier to explain your gift if they are vegetarian or vegan consider donating to an animal rights group if they support lgbtq rights perhaps donate to human rights campaign or a similar organization connect the gift to a personal memory beyond simply connecting the charity to something they like can you select something that is meaningful to you both or to your relationship what special memories do you share with this person do they involve food do they involve the outdoors or animals choose a charity that connects with those memories 3 x trustworthy source greater good magazine journal published by uc berkeley s greater good science center which uses scientific research to promote happier living go to source include a message that explains this connection when you present them with the gift you could say something like remember when grandma used to bake extra loaves of banana bread and bring them to the church before easter that inspired me to want to feed the hungry and i thought it would make you happy to support that cause too give them a choice on a neurological level giving makes people feel happy this is what you are giving however studies show that when a person has no control over the giving the happiness effect is minimized 4 x trustworthy source greater good magazine journal published by uc berkeley s greater good science center which uses scientific research to promote happier living go to source many websites such as donorschoose org allow the recipient to select the charity they want this makes it much easier to explain your gift and furthermore the recipient will get a bigger happiness boost from the act of giving use imagery don t simply tell the recipient what their donation is doing show them request an image directly from the charity group or try to download one from their website images appeal to a different part of the brain a powerful image can influence the recipients opinion more effectively than words alone 5 x research source print out the image and give it to the recipient if the charity is working to feed hungry bellies show an image of someone being fed if the charity is building school for young women find an image of the women being helped prepare yourself for disappointment despite all of these tactics it is still possible that the recipient will be disappointed with their gift try to emotionally prepare for this reaction remind yourself of the positive impact of your gift most likely your recipient will get over their initial dismay and come to appreciate the value of such a gift,Holidays-and-Traditions

how to have good luck,as counter intuitive as it may sound if you want to have good luck you ll need to work for it good fortune is often lying around waiting to be be noticed learn to recognize opportunities for good luck and take steps to actively invite that good luck into your life,embrace the unplanned 1 x research source spontaneity can throw you off but it s also an unavoidable part of life if you want to have good luck you will need to learn to adapt to unplanned events and embrace the possible outcomes for example you might be surprised at work with overtime and your social plans for the night might be ruined sometimes overtime is just overtime and nothing more comes of it consider the possibility however that your boss will see you working hard and without complaint during that overtime by leaving a good impression you may unintentionally encourage your boss to give you greater opportunity within the company which could lead to better pay or a higher sense of job satisfaction converse with the people you meet share your story with friendly strangers and acquaintances you may make a connection with someone unexpected and that connection might prove more beneficial than you ever could have imagined you don t need to tell your entire life story to every stranger you meet but when the opportunity presents itself take the time to have a real conversation with someone you may not know very well yet ask the people you meet about their lives including their dreams and struggles more often than not they will return the favor and ask you about yours maintain good relationships aside from meeting new people you also need to maintain good relationships with the people already in your life learn to trust others and let yourself rely on them when the time is appropriate these relationships can also benefit you in unexpected ways you need to maintain your ties to people in both your personal and professional life for good or for ill the people around you are usually responsible for half if not more of your luck if you push people away or neglect your relationships the lucky breaks that others might lead you to will be lost keep an open mind chasing a goal is great but every now and then you should reassess your goals and ask yourself if they are really working for you as well as they could when you get a sign pointing you in a different direction consider following it avoid sticking with something just because you ve invested time and money in it maybe you dreamed of becoming a doctor but realized you hated the work once you started your pre med studies perhaps you ve spent the last decade working in sales but have recently acquired a taste for human resources if your past goals no longer align with who you are and what you want for your life it s time to re think them look on the bright side 2 x research source bad things happen but oftentimes these bad things could have been worse and may even have a positive side learn to look for the good in all situations something you once thought of as bad luck may actually be good luck from a different angle for instance if you returned from a blind date that went horribly wrong look for a silver lining at least your date wasn t a dangerous person who put your life or well being at risk the experience is also over and while you may not see it now may have taught you a few valuable lessons that you ll realize in a few weeks lastly meeting the wrong guy or gal now narrows down the field and may help you find the right one later know your strengths 3 x research source everyone has strengths and weaknesses know what your strengths are and make use of them as often as possible know your weaknesses as well and avoid situations that force you to rely on your weak side you can build skills and overcome past weaknesses but if you re not using the talents already available to you you re passing up a great resource that could help you travel down the road toward good fortune focusing on your strongest attributes also narrows your field of vision which in this case is a good thing you can focus more of your time and energy on a handful of things when you devote more of yourself to a task or dream you are more likely to run across the lucky break you ve been hoping for break out of your comfort zone be adventurous and take risks the key is to make most of your risks calculated ones do something that makes you nervous but plan and prepare for it in advance so that you can improve your chance of success try something you ve never tried before or visit a place you ve never been to the experience might be bad or good either way you will never know without trying before you follow your intuition make sure that you can afford to fail this might sound contrary to the concept of risk taking but it s what differentiates a foolish risk from a calculated one failing might produce negative results e g losing an investment ending a relationship but it will not make it impossible to survive e g you won t lose your house die or need to flee the country give more be generous toward other people regardless of whether or not you believe in karma the generosity you display toward others has a way of coming back to you in some form when others perceive your kindness they are more likely to be kind to you as well help others work through problems pursue their aspirations and find luck in their own lives while helping someone else through an issue you might see a lucky opportunity in your own life that was hiding in plain sight make sure that you don t keep score either you might end up doing more for someone than he or she will ever do for you or the situation could be reversed regardless it s usually easy to tell when someone is keeping score and the attitude may turn people off communicate well improve your ability to communicate with other people speak and write more fluently if you struggle with good communication now practice as much as possible until you can communicate well enough to avoid misunderstandings and persuade others to see your point of view consider learning a second language especially if you want more good luck in your career companies may consider a bilingual employee to be a greater asset than one who only knows a single language if you can speak and or write in more than one language more lucky opportunities may open up to you imitate your mentors if you don t have a mentor find at least one watch how that individual behaves and seek to weave some of those behaviors into your own life you don t need to be an exact duplicate but it doesn t hurt to copy something that clearly works there s no need to reinvent the wheel a method that has produced lucky results in the past is likely to produce lucky results again there are never any guarantees in life but this is an odd that would certainly be in your favor to bet on expect good luck to come your way don t think of good luck as something distant and unattainable instead tell yourself that good luck is a part of life that will come naturally if you allow it once you stop resisting it prosperity will reach you more readily good fortune might be right in front of your face but if you ve convinced yourself that it s far away you ll never be able to spot it take action stop waiting around for good luck to happen to you if you want to invite luck into your life you ll need to go out and meet it where it s at quit procrastinating don t put off today what you can do tomorrow if something can be done now do it now you ll never know what opportunities passed you by when you dragged your feet if you don t get out there and do something nothing will happen you can t solve a problem you never face or accomplish a goal you never pursue cut the negative self talk oftentimes you might find that you are your own worst enemy when you tell yourself that you can t do or be something you chase away opportunity quit cutting yourself down and realize that you are more capable than you think everyone has strengths and weaknesses one area of your life might be a mess but that doesn t necessarily mean that you are flawed as an overall human being when you criticize yourself make sure that you do so constructively identify faults using reason rather than emotion and look for ways to correct them instead of giving up overcome your fear of failure mistakes are a part of life but that doesn t make them unlucky the right mistake can set you on a path headed toward happiness and fulfillment if you never make that mistake though you may never find the road you need when you make a mistake or encounter failure take the opportunity and learn from it ask yourself what you could have done differently and look for objective constructive criticism quit stagnating you are a capable human being but there is always room for improvement instead of settling for your present skill set and circumstances continually seek self improvement work on both your strengths and your weaknesses educate yourself and become more of an expert at the things you pursue doing so will make it easier for you to spot lucky opportunities as they pop up in that area of your life self improvement also increases your level of self confidence shifting your mindset to a more confident one will allow you to think more positively about your circumstances finding luck where you may not have found it before stop relying on superstition 4 x research source clinging to the occasional lucky charm won t hurt anyone and if doing so opens your mind to luck then it can actually do some good relying on your charm or superstition like a crutch can do some damage though when you completely rely on an external source for luck you stop looking for luck on your own which may make it harder to find aside from making you lazy relying on superstition also takes power out of your hands instead of acknowledging that your good fortune is a direct result of your actions you give the credit to a charm that didn t actually do a single thing,Holidays-and-Traditions

to the lunar cycle and the date of the march equinox,mark the vernal equinox the date easter falls on is based on the ecclesiastical approximation of the vernal spring equinox this approximation falls on the same date each year march 21 note that this calculation relies on the ecclesiastical estimation of the vernal equinox not the actual vernal equinox identified by the astronomical system of measurement the actual moment of equinox can shift within 24 hours and may arrive a day before march 21 this is not taken into consideration when the date of easter is determined however this is the vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere only for those in the southern hemisphere it is the autumnal equinox the same date march 21 is used in both hemispheres though find the date of the first full

apostles many christian denominations celebrate the maundy washing of feet as a church ordinance good friday recognizes the day that christ was crucified holy saturday commemorates the time during which christ s body lay in the tomb it is typically viewed as a day of preparation for easter sunday count back to the wednesday six weeks before easter trace back to the sunday that came six calendar weeks earlier the wednesday immediately before that date is ash wednesday in other words ash wednesday is 46 days before easter each year ash wednesday is a formal day of repentance in many christian churches it also marks the first day of lent a period of 40 days over which christians are to spiritually prepare for easter count 40 days ahead ascension day is a christian holiday that falls exactly 39 days after easter sunday 4 x research source ascension day celebrates christ s ascension into heaven in some christian denominations it is also considered the fortieth day of easter meaning that all the days in between easter sunday and ascension day are part of the broader easter season understand the history easter has always been celebrated near the date of the jewish passover but the exact method of determining the date on which to celebrate easter has changed slightly over the centuries easter is a celebration of christ s return from the dead after his crucifixion in the bible jesus rose from the dead on the first sunday following the jewish passover passover begins on the fifteenth day of the month of nisan in the hebrew calendar this roughly corresponds to the first full moon after the march equinox but the hebrew calendar is not based on the cycles of the moon so the timing is not exact since the date of passover needed to be announced each year by jewish officials early christian leaders simplified the date of easter by scheduling it consistently for the sunday after the full moon this happened in 325 ce and was an official declaration of the council of nicaea 5 x research source the practice of using the moon and equinox as a dating system actually has ties to pagan practices though religious dates were never previously established using astronomical events in the jewish tradition from which most of christian tradition arose the practice of doing so was pagan in nature but early christians adopted it for the sake of simplifying their own dating system note the difference between gregorian and julian calendars most western churches roman catholics and most protestants follow the standard calendar also known as the gregorian calendar some orthodox christian churches still use the julian calendar to determine the date of easter the gregorian calendar was created when scientists discovered that the julian calendar was too long the dates of both calendars are similar but slightly different the gregorian calendar is more accurately aligned to the equinox remember the time frame according to either calendar easter will always fall between march 22 and april 25 this time frame does not occur over the same set of days for both calendars though if you are observing the gregorian calendar like most do the easter time frame in the julian calendar would actually run from april 3 to may 10 watch for possible reforms to the date several churches and nations have proposed various reforms to the manner in which the date of easter is determined but so far none of these reforms have been put into practice in 1997 the world council of churches discussed the possibility of replacing the current system of calculation with an equation based method of calculation that depended more directly on astronomical events this reform was scheduled for 2001 but was never actually adopted in 1928 the united kingdom actually fixed the date of easter as the first sunday after the second saturday in april but the act putting it into law was never actually implemented and the reform was never followed,Holidays-and-Traditions
how to make a chinese paper lantern,chinese paper lanterns have a long tradition dating back to the eastern han dynasty when they were used to worship buddha now they are used during the lantern festival to celebrate the last day of chinese new year 1 x research source making your own lantern is easy and while it won t light up it can be just as pretty and unique as a traditional light up lantern,get a sheet of construction paper the size does not matter but it must be rectangular something around 8 1 2 by 11 inches 22 by 28 cm would be better though for a traditional lantern choose red paper if you want a less traditional lantern you can pick a color you like cut a 1 in 2 5 cm strip from 1 of the short ends use a pencil and ruler to draw a line going across the width of the paper 1 inch 2 5 cm from the 1 of the short edges cut the strip off with scissors then set it aside 2 x research source this will eventually make the lantern s handle for a longer handle cut the strip from 1 of the long edges instead fold the paper in half lengthwise this is also known as the hot dog fold make sure that the long edges match up keep the paper folded do not open it up 3 x research source run your fingernail back and forth across the folded edge to make it nice and sharp cut slits into the fold stopping 1 inch 2 5 cm from the raw edge draw a horizontal line across the length of your paper 1 inch 2 5 cm from the top raw edge next cut slits into the bottom folded edge make each slit the same with and don t cut past the horizontal line that you drew 4 x research source make the slits about 1 inch 2 5 cm apart start and finish the slits 1 inch 2 5 cm from the left and right edges of the paper erase any pencil marks that you made once you have finished cutting the paper unfold the paper roll it into a cylinder then staple it unfold the paper first bring the narrow ends together then overlap them by 1 inch 2 5 cm to form a cylinder staple the overlapped ends at the top and bottom to hold the cylinder together 5 x research source make sure that the folded crease is sticking out not in if you were to squash the lantern between your hands the slits should flare out like a daisy you can also use a glue stick to hold the lantern together but you ll have to secure the paper with clips until the glue dries staple both ends of the 1 in 2 5 cm strip to the top of the lantern take the 1 in 2 5 cm strip that you cut off earlier place 1 end against the top edge of the lantern overlap it by about 1 inch 2 5 cm and staple it in place bring the other end to the opposite side of the lantern overlap it by another 1 in 2 5 cm and staple it as well 6 x research source make sure that you are stapling both ends of the handle to the top of the lantern not the top and bottom they should be across from each other for a nicer finish put the ends of the handle on the inside of the lantern you can use a glue stick or tacky glue for this step but you ll need to clip them in place until the glue dries get 2 pieces of paper that are 2 different colors one of the colors will go on the outside of the lantern while the other color will go on the inside construction paper will work the best but you can use cardstock as well for a traditional lantern use red for the outside of the lantern and gold for the inside 7 x research source you can also use red paper for the outside and yellow for the inside cut a 1 in 2 5 cm strip from the short edge of each paper use a pencil and ruler to draw a line going across the width of your first sheet of paper 1 inch 2 5 cm from 1 of the short ends cut the strip off then set it aside repeat this step with the second sheet of paper 8 x research source when you are done you should have 2 sheets of construction paper and two 1 in 2 5 cm wide strips cut two 1 in 2 5 cm strips from the long edge of 1 sheet choose 1 of the sheets of construction paper to go on the inside of your lantern cut two 1 in 2 5 cm wide strips from 1 of the long edges set these strips aside for later 9 x research source don t cut a 2 in 5 1 cm wide strip this may seem like a time saver but it will just create more work later on don t cut the other sheet of construction paper you want to keep that sheet at full size use a ruler and a pencil to draw guidelines for cutting if needed overlap the short ends to form a cylinder then glue or staple them take your sheet of paper that you just cut bring the short ends together and overlap them by about 1 inch 2 5 cm to create a tube staple the tube at the top and bottom edges of the seam to hold it together then set it aside 10 x research source you can use a glue stick as well use clips to hold the paper together until the glue dries fold the larger piece of paper in half hot dog style take your second sheet of construction paper the sheet that you want to be on the outside of the lantern fold it in half lengthwise or hot dog style so that the long edges match up 11 x research source run your fingernail along the folded edge a few times to make it neater cut 1 in 2 5 cm slits into the fold stopping 1 inch 2 5 cm from the top use a ruler and a pencil to draw a horizontal line across the length of your paper first 1 inch 2 5 cm below the top raw edge next cut vertical slits into the bottom folded edge of the paper stopping at this horizontal line 12 x research source make the first and last slits 1 inch 2 5 cm from the left and right edges of the paper make all of the other slits about 1 inch 2 5 cm apart as well do not cut past the horizontal line or into the folded edge if you need to draw cutting guides for the slits be sure to erase any pencil marks once you have finished unfold your paper and form it into a cylinder as well open up your paper first bring the narrow ends together then overlap them by 1 inch 2 5 cm to form a tube staple the seam at the top and bottom to hold it together 13 x research source make sure that this tube is big enough to slide over the first tube that you made you can use glue instead of staples clip the tube together until the glue dries the crease needs to be sticking out not in if you were to squash the lantern the fringe should flare out tuck the first cylinder into the second one then staple the top edges take the first tube that you made and slide it into the second tube align the top edges then secure them with tape staples or glue the outer tube will be longer than the inner tube the next step will resolve this the tube with the fringe cut into it should be on the outside make sure that the side seams align for an even nicer finish align and staple the bottom edges of both lanterns together push the bottom edge of the outer lantern until it aligns with the bottom edge of the inner lantern secure the bottom edges of both lanterns with glue or staples like before 14 x research source this should cause the outer lantern to flare out so that you can see the inner lantern use 1 of the shorter strips to make a handle take 1 of the shorter strips that you cut from the beginning staple both ends to the top of your lantern to create a handle making sure to overlap them by 1 inch 2 5 cm 15 x research source it does not matter which color of strip you use for this step you can use the strip that matches the outer lantern or the strip that matches the inner lantern it doesn t matter if you add the handle to the outside or inside of the lantern the next step will cover it up wrap the longer strips around the top and bottom edges take 1 of the long strips that you cut off from your inner lantern coat the back of the strip with glue then wrap it around the top of your lantern making sure that the edges align repeat this step with the second strip for the bottom edge 16 x research

atmosphere where guests can mingle and enjoy life is the purpose no one likes to feel that something is expected of them at a party guests often like to help out with what needs doing at a party

and family involved if you re hosting a house party or a shindig where you will be doing some of the legwork enlist family and friends to come early to help with the preparations and get to enjoy your birthday glow before the larger party gets started ask friends to bring something rather than accepting gifts requesting contributions to the birthday party effort suggesting that guests bring drinks

involved and feel that they have contributed to a party or gathering they will feel more invested in the sense of camaraderie and community that a good party creates if you re going for a full meal at your party potlucks are a great way to make your friends a part of the cooking ask everyone to bring a dish or create a signup sheet with an online invite service for coordination of dishes know anyone who is known amongst friends for a special dish or dessert they make ask them if they would like to make it for your birthday they ll feel appreciated and so will you release the reins release

it s your birthday and well you can cry if you want to but there s really no need everyone will have a good time if the host or guest of honor is relaxed and enjoying themselves so that s all you need to worry about things happening differently than planned makes for a great story so when the section of birthday cake with your name on it falls off the serving knife don t sweat it let yourself be

and family members before you get on to the later events of your birthday pamper yourself also get some quality spa or massage time or have a luxurious bath followed by chocolates put aside your

days where everything can be all about you but because a birthday is anticipated to be so magical it can often be a day full of disappointments that leads to post celebration blues,throw a brief pity party and then move on having a bad birthday is a huge letdown acknowledging that it was a bummer and mourning a little bit is important if you pretend you re not upset it can lead to a prolonged bad mood 1 x research source eat some ice cream or have a good cry but then move on you have some fun to plan throw yourself a post birthday party if your birthday didn t go the way you wanted it to take

invite as many or as little people as you feel comfortable you control the guest list if you re going out pick a favorite restaurant you already love or if you re feeling adventurous go to a new place you ve been wanting to try if you re staying in buy or make food and decorations to highlight the birthday theme or consider incorporating a nontraditional theme like a favorite era or trend to liven it up further buy or make a cake to make it feel like a real birthday celebration treat yourself to some additional birthday extras there s no rule that says you can only accept gifts on your birthday so go out and treat yourself to some gifts during your birthday redo make sure to do things on that day or week that you will enjoy this won t fix your bad birthday completely but treating yourself can help ease the sting in the meantime buy yourself a present you were hoping to get but did not rent a favorite movie and order takeout from your favorite restaurant invite some friends over or have a solo diy spa day reflect on your disappointment take a moment to evaluate why you feel like you had a bad birthday did you want more attention from someone in particular was there an activity you were hoping to do but did not do birthdays always make you bummed understanding why you feel disappointed in particular will help you to address your bad mood assess whether or not you were anticipating disappointment for some people birthdays are a time when we worry so much about the big day before it happens that we experience the disappointment as though it has already occurred 2 x research source leading up to your birthday consider whether you were focusing on what you were worried would not happen if you were so worried about what gifts you would or wouldn t get or whether or not someone special would call on your birthday you have worked yourself up so much before your birthday even started this type of thinking causes so much anxiety about birthday expectations that having any fun is an uphill battle looking forward to what could happen rather than worrying about what won t happen this type of thinking is much more hopeful about all of the upcoming possibilities instead of looking towards the future with anxiety about what might not happen you were looking forward to your birthday with feelings of excitement and anticipation consider what your expectations were birthday expectations the anticipations for the day that often lead to a disappointing bad birthday typically fall into one of the following categories 3 x research source expectations of the birthday celebrations themselves because many of us expect birthdays to be a big deal a full day when you are showered with gifts and attention when this level of hype is not met the overall feeling for the day is that it was a big letdown we focus so much on what the birthday should be that we don t enjoy what it is expectations of where and what our life should be birthdays come once a year and are a prime time to reflect on the past year and consider the future for some this means coming to terms with the inaccuracy of the timeline of goals we devise for ourselves these expectations are often harder to deal with and can definitely sour a birthday understand that disappointment comes from within yes a birthday is a special day and yes you deserve to feel warmth and love on your birthday but nowhere is there a rule that says the entire world must revolve around you on that day disappointment is a feeling that is conjured internally and thus realizing that you are creating your own misery is key to changing how you think about the day 4 x research source pinpoint the exact cause behind your conjured disappointment because disappointment is a feeling that is created internally isolating the exact emotion causing the disappointment can help you move past the bad mood 5 x research source do you feel rejected especially since everything is posted on social media even small rejections like not many people writing happy birthday on your wall can feel intensely hurtful try to remember that anyone reaching out in any manner is a wonderful gesture it s not a competition for the most postings or likes are you worried about outstanding goals if expectations of where your life should be are causing your bad mood reflect on when and why you came up with that goal in the first place comparing yourself to others is never a good idea and maybe the goals you made for yourself when you were younger no longer match what you really want for yourself now are you brooding over one particular person not wishing you well on your birthday perhaps an ex or a crush didn t reach out on your birthday which can sting instead of thinking about the one person who didn t call think about those who did reread the cards or wall posts you received and redirect your thinking move past your disappointment rehashing the negatives of the day will not change the situation or the people you feel neglected you on your birthday thinking about it will not change what happened but it will make you feel worse instead redirect your thoughts and focus on something positive 6 x research source for example think about all that you have accomplished in the past year and beyond you might not be where you thought you d be at this time but you shouldn t negate the goals you did accomplish take a minute to make a list of wins for the year make a plan for what you would like to accomplish this year moving forward just remember to make your goals reasonable so that you don t set yourself up for more disappointment next year make a plan to really celebrate someone else s birthday if a friend or family members birthday is coming up get over your disappointment by helping to ensure that they aren t disappointed like you were on their special day it will make you feel better and it will make them feel loved lower your expectations maybe as a child you had a week of birthday celebrations culminating in a huge party with a giant cake that s great but it can profoundly affect what you expect for your current birthdays instead of expecting a big celebration next year try not expecting anyone to do anything this sounds negative but this will actually mean that anything good that happens will be an unexpected surprise understand that you only have control over yourself you cannot make your friends and family celebrate your birthday but you do have control over what the disappointment does to you don t let it consume you but don t ignore it either acknowledge that you are disappointed and then move on with your internal dialogue 7 x research source let your friends and family know it is likely that your friends and family don t realize that you feel you had a bad birthday perhaps this is because they feel like they celebrated your birthday appropriately and your expectations were just higher or perhaps birthdays are not as big of a deal to them either way consider one of these conversation starters so i m thinking i might schedule a massage since my birthday was last week this should let them know that you were hoping for some more treats on your birthday can you please help me organize a belated outing for my birthday there s nothing wrong with asking for help in fact this will not only let them know that your expectations weren t met but will also ensure that the activities are exactly what you want to do i know we went out to dinner for my birthday but i kind of feel like going dancing too what do you think this is a subtle but non passive aggressive way of indicating that you enjoyed the birthday activities thus far but were also hoping for a little more fun before the day is over learn from it whether you consistently feel bummed about your birthday or this was the first year you had a bad birthday learn from your experience and let that knowledge influence your entire year also try putting it into perspective is this birthday disappointment something that you will remember in 6 months 3 months 8 x research source be thankful for all that you have happy birthday,Holidays-and-Traditions

ornaments and make them look like new again,measure out 20 in 51 cm of ribbon pick out a 3 to 4 in 7 6 to 10 2 cm wide ribbon with a wire running through the top and bottom then measure out 20 inches 51 cm of it you can leave the edges straight for now since you ll be able to clean them up later 1 x research source wide ribbon makes a better bow because it stands out more try picking a ribbon that matches the theme of your ornament fold the 2 sides inwards so they overlap each other on a flat surface spread the ribbon out so that the long side faces you grab the 2 ends and pull them in towards the center underneath the ribbon overlapping them to create an awareness ribbon shape on your flat surface 2 x research source you should be left with a small opening in the center of the bow and the 2 tail ends hanging over each other pinch the center of the bow together keeping the ends overlapped pick up your ribbon and pinch the center between 2 of your fingers to create the classic bow shape don t worry if your bow doesn t hold the shape on its own just yet 3 x research source if your ribbon has wire in it it may hold the shape pretty well wrap a pipe cleaner around the center of the bow cut a 3 to 4 in 7 6 to 10 2 cm piece of pipe cleaner out and wrap it around the center of the bow shape you just made press the ends of the pipe cleaner down so they wrap flush around the bow trying not to let them stick up anywhere 4 x research source if you have a lot of excess pipe cleaner sticking out you can cut the ends off with scissors you don t have to match the pipe cleaner color to your ribbon since you ll be covering it up later cut out a 3 5 in 8 9 cm length of the same ribbon measure out a smaller length of the same ribbon you just used then use your scissors to cut it out again you can set your main bow aside for now since it should hold its shape all on its own 5 x research source using the same kind of ribbon will make your bow look more cohesive fold the small ribbon in half then glue the edges down spread the smaller length of ribbon out flat then fold the edges in towards each other so they meet in the middle lengthwise grab a hot glue gun and use it to stick the edges together so you have a seamless long ribbon piece 6 x research source wrap the small ribbon around the center of the bow then glue it in place wrap the small ribbon around the front of your bow and press the edges down onto the back of the bow use your hot glue gun again to stick the ends down in the back of the bow cutting off any excess ribbon if you need to 7 x research source this is to disguise the pipe cleaner in the center of the bow that s holding the shape cut the edges of the bow at a diagonal grab your scissors again and hold them on one of the tails of the bow at a diagonal cut down in one smooth motion so the tail is cut at a diagonal then do the same to the other tail 8 x research source this will give the edges a more polished look squeeze a dot of hot glue onto the metal ornament base grab your ornament and squeeze out a dot of hot glue onto the metal base of the ornament hook try not to get hot glue anywhere else on the ornament to avoid clouding the design 9 x research source if your ornament doesn t have a hook you can find packs of them at most craft supply stores press the bow onto the hot glue then let it dry for 30 minutes pick up your bow and press the center of it onto the dot of hot glue then hold it there for about 1 minute to let the glue bond set your ornament aside for about 30 minutes to let it dry fully then hang it on your tree 10 x research source you can make multiple ornaments with different colored bows or a set of ornaments with the same color scheme cut out 18 in 46 cm of skinny ribbon find a length of ribbon that s about 1 in 2 5 cm wide then cut out 18 in 46 cm of it you don t need to worry about how the edges look for now since you ll be cutting them later on 11 x research source skinny ribbon works the best for this type of ornament bow because it can fit through an ornament hook much easier than wide ribbon can wrap the ribbon once around a chair or bed post to hold its shape find an object in your house that s about 6 inches 15 cm wide to use as a template for your ribbon loop wrap the ribbon length around the chair post bed post or even a round glass to start making your bow 12 x research source the wider the object is the longer the loop on the back of your ornament will be tie the ends of the ribbon together in a tight knot grab the 2 ends of the ribbon length and cross them over each other on the front of your chair or bed post overlap the 2 ends then pull them together tightly to make a basic knot 13 x research source the knot won t hold itself together just yet because the ribbon is too slippery create a classic bow with the tail ends of the ribbon grab one tail of the ribbon and fold it upwards to make a small loop then wrap the other ribbon tail around the base of the loop pull the loose end behind the back of the loop to create a classic bow then pull it tight 14 x research source think of making a bow in the same way you d tie your shoelaces cut the tails of the bow at an angle grab some scissors and hold them at a diagonal against one of the tails of the bow cut the edge at a diagonal then do the same to the other tail to clean them up 15 x research source if the tails of your bow are too long you can also use your scissors to cut off some length before you cut them at an angle slide the ribbon off the post leaving the large loop in the back grab the ribbon and gently pull it off of the base object you were using keep hold of the bow so that it doesn t pull apart and leave the long loop at the back of the bow intact 16 x research source thread the back loop through a metal ornament hanger grab an ornament that has a hanger on top but no hook to hang it with push the long loop of your ribbon through the front of the metal loop sliding it through until the bow rests on top of your ornament 17 x research source if you re having trouble getting the ribbon through the metal loop pinch it between your fingers before you thread it through use the back loop to hang your ornament grab your ornament by the long loop in the back and hang it up on your tree you can make a few ornaments in this style to decorate and hang your ornaments at the same time 18 x research source this is a great trick to use if you don t have any more ornament hooks or you want to spice up some plain decorations,Holidays-and-Traditions

how to hang icicle lights on a railing,icicle lights are a popular type of string light for christmas and holiday lighting you can also use them to create romantic lighting for a special event like a wedding hang icicle lights along your railing to light up a balcony patio or staircase you can easily do this with cheap supplies available online or at a home improvement center or hardware store soon enough your railing will have a beautiful new glow,use screw in hooks for wood railings metal hooks with screws work well for wood railings they will allow you to easily hang and take down any type of string lights along your railing 1 x research source installing hooks on your railing gives you the option to switch out the lights throughout the year for example you could hang icicle lights during the holidays then switch to market style string lights for the rest of the year if you don t want to install lights long term consider using another method like zip ties to hang them so you don t have to make holes in your wood railing utilize adhesive hooks for non wood railings adhesive hooks work well for railings made out of materials like metal or concrete when you can t easily screw a hook into the railings you will also be able to take the hooks down without leaving any holes in your railing if you want to remove them later on 2 x research source any type of self adhesive hooks will work for this for example there are metal and plastic varieties that you can choose from install 1 hook between every 2 3 vertical rails screw a hook into the underside of the top horizontal rail between every 2 3 vertical rails if you re using screw in hooks stick a hook to the underside or the side of the top rail every 2 3 vertical rails if you re using adhesive hooks 3 x research source this will allow you to hang the icicle lights straight along your railing if you want to create a more drooping effect you could spread the hooks out further such as every 5 vertical railings or every large railing post string your icicle lights straight along the railing across the hooks start at the end closest to the outlet that you will plug the lights into and place the end of the wire that has the plug over the first hook at that end stretch the lights out straight along the railing pulling the wire tight as you go from hook to hook until you reach the end of the railing 4 x research source if you have any extra icicle lights leftover at the end of the strand after you finish hanging the lights along the railing just double the strand back over itself and hang the remaining length up the lights will blend together and create a nice layered look if you want the lights to be more swooping don t pull the wire all the way tight you can create loose u shaped patterns with the lights instead icicle light strings come in different lengths so make sure you have enough to cover your railing for example if your railing is 15 ft 4 6 m long you might use 2 7 5 ft 2 3 m long strings of icicle lights hook garlands or bows along your railing to upgrade its holiday look string a garland along your railing from hook to hook to add some festive greenery to the railing stick colorful bows to every second or third hook to add some colorful holiday cheer 5 x research source if you decide to add a garland you can drape it along directly on top of the icicle light wire or in a different pattern depending on the look you re going for for example you could drape it in a u shaped swooping pattern and maybe put a bow centered above the middle of every u shaped drooping section select zip ties that are close to the size and color of your railing pick out some zip ties that are long enough to wrap around your railing with enough extra length to pull the end of the zip tie through the locking head choose a color that is similar to the color of your railing so the zip ties blend in 6 x research source the locking head is the end of the zip tie that has a hole in it through which you secure the pointy end of the zip tie to secure it in place for example if your railing is 2 in 5 1 cm thick by 4 in 10 cm wide use zip ties that are at least 13 14 in 33 36 cm long this is a good method if you just want to temporarily hang up icicle lights you can easily remove the zip ties and stow away your lights after the holidays are over for example wrap a zip tie around the string of lights and the railing at 1 end of the railing start at the end of the railing closest to the outlet that you plan on plugging the lights into hold the plug end of the icicle lights against the top horizontal railing wrap a zip tie around it and stick the end of the zip tie into the locking head 7 x research source you can also secure the hanging plug end of the icicle lights where there are no light bulbs to a vertical railing or the post at the end of the railing to keep it neatly hidden pull the zip tie tight leaving enough slack that it doesn t pinch the wire grab the end of the zip tie and pull it through the locking head until it cinches down and holds the wire of the lights tightly to the rail without pinching or cutting into the wire leaving a bit of slack will ensure that you don t accidentally damage the wire and cause the lights not to work 8 x research source it will also be easier to cut the zip ties when you want to take down the lights if there is a little bit of slack as well repeat the process every 2 3 rails to string the lights along your whole railing pull the lights straight along the top horizontal rail wrap another zip tie around the rail and the wire 2 3 vertical rails away from the first zip tie then tighten it enough to hold the lights in place without pinching the wire do this until you finish hanging the lights along your railing 9 x research source alternatively you could place the zip ties further apart and not pull the string of lights completely straight to give the lights a sweeping look make sure you have enough icicle lights to cover your railing for example if your railing is 18 ft 5 5 m long you could use 2 9 ft 2 7 m long strings of icicle lights use wire cutters or scissors to cut the excess length off the ends of the zip ties cut off the excess length as close to the locking heads as possible this will make the zip ties less visible along your railing 10 x research source when you want to take the lights down just cut the zip ties off your railing using scissors or wire cutters add garlands or bows to your railing to give it a more festive look stretch out a garland along the icicle light wire and secure it in place with zip ties if you want to add greenery to your holiday decorations secure a colorful bow to the railing with a zip tie every 5 10 rails if you want to add some holiday color 11 x research source garlands and bows also help hide the light wires to create a more tidy look along your railing,Holidays-and-Traditions

how to store christmas wreaths,while live christmas wreaths only last for a single season fake wreaths can be stored and used for future holiday celebrations 1 x research source unlike ornaments and other decorations wreaths are easy to put away for the season and just as easy to take out again if you re only storing a few wreaths some large boxes or containers may fit the bill for your storage needs if you have a lot of wreaths on hand you may want to use some hangers or storage racks to organize your decorations,place your wreaths in bubble wrap or a trash bag find a clean trash bag or an empty section of unpopped bubble wrap that s big enough to fit around your wreath check that the wreath is completely surrounded in plastic so it ll be a little cushioned while it s in storage 2 x research source you can find bubble wrap at most stores that sell postal supplies arrange your wreath in the bottom of a hat box or large container check that the wreath is centered and that it fits comfortably if you have a lot of different wreaths you may need differently sized hat boxes for your storage needs large plastic containers can also work in a pinch 3 x research source you can buy hat boxes online or at a home goods store these boxes are especially handy since they re naturally circular stack multiple wreaths on top of one another if there s enough room depending on the size of your wreath and your hat box you may be able to fit several thin wreaths on top of one another play around with your different wreaths and boxes until you find a storage solution that works well for you 4 x research source if your wreaths are really bushy you probably won t be able to stack them in boxes label the lid of the box so you remember what s inside take an office label or section of masking tape and write christmas wreaths on it or something similar place this label on the box so you know exactly what it is this makes it easier to find your decorations when the holidays roll around again attach a looped section of twist tie around your wreath find an old twist tie or section of thin wire and loop it into a circle secure the loop around the top of your wreath so it s easier to attach to a hanger 5 x research source if the twist tie isn t long enough to make a loop twist or tape multiple ties together you can purchase thin wire or twist ties online don t close the loop yet as you still need to attach the wreath to the actual hanger if you re having trouble bending the wire use a pair of pliers arrange the looped wreath onto the bottom of a clothes hanger loop the wire along the straight bottom section of the hanger then twist both ends of the loop together to secure it check that the wreath is securely attached to the hanger before you move it around 6 x research source use a sturdy hanger for this plastic hangers may not be strong enough to support your wreath you can repeat this process for however many wreaths you have drape a trash bag or dry cleaner bag over the wreath and hanger place a large garment bag or trash bag over your wreath then poke the top of the hanger out from the top this helps keep your wreaths clean and dry during the off season 7 x research source hook the hanger in a cool dry storage area find an open storage space where there s room to hang up your wreaths like an empty closet or a section of your basement 8 x research source check that the area is cool and dry so your wreaths stay in good condition during the year 9 x research source a basement or empty closet is a great place to store your wreaths you can also hook the hanger on a portable storage rack you can find these at most home improvement stores,Holidays-and-Traditions
how to do cellophane wrapping,a big part of creating a beautiful unique gift basket is finishing it by wrapping it in shimmery shiny cellophane paper it may take a few minutes to make sure you re using enough paper and getting it situated right but putting a little extra attention into this task will pay off big dividends and help you become a master at gift basket wrapping this is a great skill that will help you create charming gifts for your friends and family,purchase rolls of cellophane online or from a craft store similar to rolls of wrapping paper you can purchase big rolls of cellophane for all your crafting and gift basket making needs there are tons of different colors and patterns you can choose from too 1 x research source you may even be able to buy a length of cellophane from a local florist shop clear cellophane would be nice if you want the contents of a gift basket to be visible colored or patterned cellophane can add an extra pop of fun to your gift measure enough cellophane to completely wrap around the container clear a large work area and pull out a long length of cellophane from the roll place the container in the middle and pull the cellophane up on either side adjust how much cellophane there is until the whole container is covered and then add an additional 6 12 inches 150 300 mm to that length 2 x research source ideally work on a hard clean surface rather than on carpet the cellophane will attract little fibers and bits of dust remember it s better to have too much cellophane you can always trim away excess material but it s a lot harder to add more without it looking funny cut the cellophane and lay it out flat on your work surface use a pair of sharp craft scissors as you cut try to make it as smooth as possible so there aren t any jagged edges 4 x research source once you make the initial cut you should hopefully be able to just glide your scissors down the length of the cellophane this prevents weird edges from forming place the prepared container in the center of the piece of cellophane position the front of the basket or container so that it s parallel to one of the straight edges of the cellophane this way when you wrap the container the seams of cellophane will be on the sides rather than in the front 5 x research source it s best to work with a container that has already been prepared that way you can make sure to position it exactly how you want it and you ll be able to better see where you should tie the ribbon at the end bring the sides of cellophane together overtop of the container it s okay if the sides don t quite reach all the way you ll stick those in place later right now just focus on creating a poof of cellophane at the top 6 x research source one of the great things about cellophane is that it s supposed to look a little messy it doesn t matter if the pieces aren t perfectly smooth in fact they re not meant to be secure the poof of cellophane with a decorative ribbon or bow this can take a little finagling especially if you re working with a particularly large basket or container hold the poof in one hand and wrap the ribbon around it with your other hand tie a bow with the ribbon 7 x research source try your best to position the ribbon overtop of the highest point in the basket or container this should hopefully make things look very balanced trim long edges and tape down loose sections of cellophane take a look at the poof of cellophane and cut away any super long pieces that extend out past the rest of the material then use clear tape to secure pieces of cellophane that weren t quite long enough to reach the top 9 x research source try to focus on making sure there are no blank spaces or little gaps where you can see between pieces of cellophane into the basket open the cellophane bag and place the gift basket inside shrink bags are sealed on the bottom and the sides making them much easier to use to wrap gift baskets and other oddly shaped containers simply separate the 2 sides of the bag and hold them open while putting your prepared gift basket at the bottom 10 x research source do your best to center the gift basket so that the bottom seam of the bag is along the middle of the basket a shrink bag is a great option to create a tightly sealed basket it ll help keep items in place more securely which is important if there are fragile items or if you ll be traveling with it 11 x research source lift the sides of the bag around the basket once the gift basket is in place carefully extend the sides to their full length around the entire basket there will probably be excess space on either side of the basket as well as on top but don t worry that will all get taken care of when you shrink wrap it 12 x research source it s generally easier to work with a filled basket rather than an empty one if you didn t already fill your basket though now is the time to do so tie the top of the shrink wrap together with a twist tie gather the shrink wrap on either side of the basket and bring it all together in the middle to create a poof secure this poof with a twist tie or rubber band so it doesn t come undone 14 x research source hold off on using ribbon or a bow at this stage move a heat gun back and forth over the basket to shrink the cellophane set the heat gun to a medium or high heat and hold it about 6 inches 150 mm away from the basket continue waving it back and forth over the entire basket until you notice the cellophane bag starting to shrink and adhere more tightly to the basket itself 15 x research source if you don t have a heat gun you could also use a hairdryer on the highest setting for the same results 16 x research source avoid holding the heat gun in one place for very long this could burn through the cellophane finish your basket with a decorative ribbon or bow once you re done shrinking the cellophane cover or replace the twist tie with something a little more festive you could use a simple ribbon for an elegant touch or get more creative with a big bow and spiraled ribbons 17 x research source if you notice a section of the bag that seems too loose just use your heat gun on it again,Holidays-and-Traditions
how to pick good chestnuts,chestnuts are well known as a buttery sweet treat in the winter however chestnuts are also very delicate to get the freshest ones available you have to know the signs good chestnuts are easy to find just by looking at them and picking them up if you have chestnut trees in your area you could also go outdoors and collect wild ones to bring home there are many ways you can enjoy them such as by roasting them or working them into soups stuffings deserts and many other recipes,find chestnuts that have a dark brown shell unripened chestnuts have a light coloring that makes them look pale next to better ones check the entire chestnut particularly its top and bottom for discolorations its shell should look pretty consistent if it has spots that look yellow or a pale white then put it back 1 x research source every chestnut has a small patch on it where the actual nut is visible underneath the shell it should be a uniform light brown color it won t be as dark as the rest of the shell spots are usually signs of mold so throw away any chestnuts that look discolored they spoil pretty quickly inspect the shell to see if it s shiny instead of dull ripe chestnuts have a slight shine to their shell since the shell is a dark brown color you will be able to see its shine when you hold it under a light as chestnuts get older they dull and start to lose their flavor 2 x research source if you re uncertain hold the chestnut next to one that you know is ripe look at the shine on the ripe one then look back at the one you re checking the difference will be noticeable check for cracks or other imperfections in the shell if you see signs of damage the chestnut may be old and dried out avoid any chestnuts that have a broken shell also look for ugly looking discolorations since they are probably signs of mold moldy chestnuts have white or blue spots that sometimes look fuzzy 3 x research source the moldy ones can make you sick so don t bother with any that you suspect might have started to spoil if you see holes in the shell it could be from worms or something else that has tried turning the chestnut into a snack pick up the chestnut to see if it feels heavy for its size good chestnuts feel solid and full they have a certain weight to them like they would make an impact if you threw them across the room unripened chestnuts haven t had enough time to grow so they feel a little lighter try to compare different chestnuts to avoid ones that feel unusually light 4 x research source heavy chestnuts have more to offer the nut inside the shell will be bigger so you will get more for your money they also taste better the weight depends on the chestnut s size if you pick up a big chesnut it should feel heavier than smaller ones squeeze the chesnut to make sure it feels firm chestnut shells are very hard so you will know something is wrong if it collapses in your hand it s okay for the shell to be a little springy but that means the chestnut has finished ripening if the shell is completely hard all over the chestnut is still good but it hasn t finished ripening yet 5 x research source if you notice a slight give when you squeeze the shell plan on using the chestnut as soon as possible hard chestnuts have to be left out for about 3 to 4 days to soften afterward do the squeeze test again old chestnuts also harden as they dry out so make sure you re buying fresh ones check for mold lightness or rattling to determine which ones have gone bad shake the chestnut and listen for a rattling sound if the chestnut has shrunken you will be able to hear it moving around inside its shell chestnuts get smaller and more unpleasant to eat over time rattling is sure sign that a chestnut has gone bad 6 x research source ripe chestnuts almost completely fill their shell so you won t hear them rattling around when you shake them wait for autumn to hunt for chestnuts chestnuts start ripening around the end of august however they don t all ripen at the same time so you can find good ones for weeks after that they are most common in september you might be able to find a few in november as well 7 x research source chestnuts grow throughout most of the world if you re in the southern half of the world chestnuts are available around april they won t be ready in any other month so there is no use in trying to pick them off the trees if you re looking during the rest of the year figure out where the chestnut trees are in your area so you can come back to them during the harvest season spot chestnut trees by their long leaves and spiky pods chestnut trees have long skinny leaves shaped like canoes the leaves have teeth or small spikes around the edges chestnuts grow in spiky green pods among the leaves they start appearing in summer so check back after then to be sure you re foraging from the right kind of tree 8 x research source chestnut trees are usually 50 to 75 ft 15 to 23 m tall at full height chestnut branches have 5 similarly shaped leaves on their ends similar trees like horse chestnuts have leaves that look less uniform and attach to the same point on the branch search for chestnuts that have fallen to the ground chestnuts that are still hanging aren t ripe enough to eat so you don t have to worry about reaching high branches just look for any spiky pods that have fallen to the ground check underneath the branches and around the trunk they are green with noticeable spikes and if they have cracked open you will be able to see the brown chestnuts inside them 9 x research source chestnut pods look like fuzzy green balls when they open you will see brown nuts with a pointed end that has a little leafy tail on it be aware of horse chestnuts since they look somewhat similar but toxic horse chestnuts grow in pods that are smooth with few spikes the nuts are smooth with a big white patch that has an indentation on it wear damage resistant gloves while handling chestnut pods if you have seen a chestnut pod you know how sharp it is to protect your hands keep them covered until you re finished removing the nuts from their pods the needles are sharp enough to put a hole in heavy gloves so be careful 10 x research source for additional protection double up your gloves for example wear rubber gloves over leather ones the pods are too sharp to handle by hand if you don t have gloves break open the pods first such as by stepping on them then carefully pick out the nuts pull the chestnuts out of their pods to collect them search for pods that have split open first grip the open ends of the pods and pull them apart to reveal the nuts pull the nuts out then move them to a collection basket or blanket if you still have room for more chestnuts you can go back and force open the pods that haven t split 11 x research source to open an unbroken pod step on them place your feet on the sides and push down until the nuts start to pop out even if the pod hasn t opened on its own the nuts inside will usually still be fresh inspect the chestnuts for mold holes and other signs of damage wild chestnuts have a dark brown shell that shines when it s fresh the nut should also feel firm whole and heavy for its size make sure the shell is intact since worms and other forest animals can get into nuts that have been on the ground 12 x research source you won t find too many old nuts on the ground animals usually eat them before they have a chance to go bad the main problem is holes from worms that have eaten through the shell leave damaged chestnuts behind just drop them on the ground so animals can eat them place the chestnuts in an unsealed paper bag you don t have to wash them or peel them until you re ready to eat them keep them covered but unsealed so moisture doesn t accumulate inside of the bag you could also use a ventilated bag or put them in a plastic bag left open at one end 13 x research source if you re planning on freezing chestnuts place them in a resealable freezer safe container such as a plastic freezer bag store chestnuts in a paper bag in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks fresh chestnuts should always be stored in the refrigerator set to about 34 f 1 c make sure they are in an unsealed bag labeled with the current date to keep them fresh place them inside a crisper drawer if you have one when you re ready to use them take them back out and clean them off 14 x research source check the chestnuts on occasion for softness or mold throw away ones that have spoiled be aware of any signs of aging or mold chestnuts unfortunately don t stay fresh for very long so try to use them as soon as possible move chestnuts into a freezer safe container to freeze for up to 3 months place them in a freezer safe container label it with today s date before packing it in the freezer when you re ready to use the chestnuts take them back out leave them out at room temperature for about 3 to 4 hours if you need to thaw them out to use them 15 x research source chestnuts can be frozen with or without their shells they are easier to work with if they have been deshelled ahead of time you could also freeze cooked chestnuts chestnuts lose their texture in the freezer instead of roasting frozen chestnuts try using them in recipes like for soups or cakes,Holidays-and-Traditions

threatening you don t want an april fool s joke to cost you a relationship a job or even worse land you in jail 3 x research source for instance filling a room with balloons is silly making someone trip when they walk in the room could be more serious especially if it leads to injury try bedtime pranks one good easy prank is to put something under a person s pillow messy substances work best for this prank such as marshmallow cream or shaving cream when the person gets ready to go to sleep they ll stick their hands under the pillow and find a silly surprise create alarm clock fun alarm clocks are often used to prank people because you can set them to go off at a later time one way to use alarm clocks is to gather a bunch of them and hide them around someone s room set them to go off at different times during the night 4 x research source another option that takes more commitment is to make someone early for something for instance if your spouse gets up before dawn to go to work you can set all the clocks and smartphones in the house to several hours earlier when your spouse gets up at his or her normal time it will actually be hours earlier fake destroying important documents secretly make a copy of documents important to a friend or coworker hide the original away in front of the person accidentally spill coffee on it 5 x research source this prank works especially well if it s something that s not easily reproduced such as a birth certificate car title or something that was notarized it also works well to play it on a friend who doesn t have easy access to a printer and who has printed off a paper for class already cover a car in sticky notes this prank takes some time and commitment but the shock value is worth it simply buy a bunch of sticky notes and cover the entire car with them the driver will have to remove them before he or she can leave 6 x research source it s maybe best not to play this prank when it will make someone late to work school or another commitment it can take a while to remove all of the sticky notes so allow ample time wrap a phone in rubber bands this prank is a good one for the office simply use rubber bands large enough to wrap around the person s office phone then completely wrap the phone in rubber bands when they go to use the phone they ll have to unwrap it first 7 x research source remember that you re taking a chance anytime you pull a prank at the office you re cutting down on productivity and your boss may not be okay with that make sure you are willing to accept the consequences before you pull an office prank grow a garden in a keyboard one way to prank coworkers is to grow gardens in keyboards and switch them out for the working keyboards when your coworkers come in you ll definitely get a laugh 8 x research source start with an old broken keyboard add water soil and chia or grass seeds enclose it in a clear plastic bag loosely to create a greenhouse and set it in a sunny spot check on the soil every day to make sure it stays moist let it grow for about a week set the garden keyboard on the desk and hide the person s regular keyboard it is not a good idea to do this prank on a working office keyboard that is destruction of company property and you could easily be fired for that even if you re not using company property consider your office atmosphere and the temperament of your boss before pulling this prank make mayo donuts buy a box of glazed donuts on top of them spread or pipe mayonnaise to look like frosting your unsuspecting coworkers will get a mouthful of mayonnaise when they re expecting sweet frosting 9 x research source this prank could backfire if someone has a food allergy or is vegan or vegetarian just be sure you take that into consideration before attempting it freeze their computers one way to prank coworkers is to take a screenshot of their computer screens then you replace their background with that screenshot once you hide the icons it will look like their regular screen but they won t be able to click on anything 10 x research source start by hitting print screen on their keyboard paste it into a program like paint save it as an image next replace the background image with your image you can usually do this step by right clicking on the screen and hitting personalize or preferences on the menu hide the icons the easiest way to hide the icons is to right click on the desktop then move to view next uncheck the box for show desktop icons check this box again when you want them to reappear 11 x research source once again this prank will cut down on productivity so make sure you re okay with the consequences if your boss isn t happy don t use a prank to isolate and humiliate someone in some settings such as the office pranks are often played on either the top performer or the under performer in other words the prank is often played on someone that others would like to see humbled a bit in that case the prank can go pretty wrong considering that the person you re pranking could end up feeling victimized leading to poor office morale or even consequences for you 12 x research source also it s never a good idea to prank the boss unless she or he has created an atmosphere where everyone gets pranked now and then stick to people who can take the joke or even unilaterally play it on everyone another option is just sticking to friends and loved ones who know you care about them skip the scare tactics simply jumping out at someone may not be so bad but pulling elaborate pranks that fake someone s death are much less appropriate for instance if your girlfriend faked her death how would that make you feel most people are left feeling hurt and vulnerable even after the prank has been revealed so it s a good idea to skip these types of pranks 13 x research source avoid good news pranks that is don t tell someone they ve won a car for example it gets their hopes up and then you just have to dash them later this type of prank can turn cruel very quickly 14 x research source this step is even more true when it s more personal for instance telling someone their song is going to be played on the radio can raise false hopes that will leave the person feeling very disappointed don t do anything dangerous hitting someone in the face with a cream pie isn t dangerous digging a hole for someone to fall in is dangerous you don t want to cause harm to another person especially since you could be liable for any hospital bills or even face criminal charges 15 x research source skip anything illegal it can be easy to tip into illegal activities when pulling a prank moving someone s car permanently damaging property or even tripping someone could all be construed as illegal if things go wrong think about

chair if using the back of the chair drape your coworker s sweater over it so that the whoopee cushion will remain hidden make sure the coworker you choose has a good sense of humor many people would

how to observe safe toys and gifts month,for many cultures and beliefs december is a time when gifts are given in abundance to celebrate to congratulate and to show gratitude for people we spend time with the safety and age appropriateness of gifts isn t always uppermost in the gift purchaser s mind though mostly because we trust that the retailer is providing items that are already certified as safe and also because sometimes we re not totally clued into the needs or age specific particulars of the gift recipients in the united states december is observed as safe toys and gifts month as a means for alerting us to the need to be careful when making our toy and gift choices and to prompt us to keep in mind their safety and suitability knowing what to look out for can make a big difference in preventing possible injuries from well intentioned gifts this article provides an overview of the things to bear in mind when shopping for those toys and gifts,buy age appropriate toys children soon let you know if you ve purchased them a toy that s below their age group and most shoppers take great care to avoid such a slip up yet strangely we re prone to thinking that purchasing toys that are meant for an older age group is fine as if somehow it s suggesting that the child in question is smarter than their age group already or they ll grow into it the problem is that toys are age graded for safety reasons as much as for avoiding frustration and undesirability many toys aimed at older children contain small pieces which could be swallowed by a younger child toys for older children can also contain items that require responsible handling for example the popular beyblade battle tops would be appropriate for an 11 year old but not for a six year old video games have age ratings for a reason observe them read how to choose age appropriate gifts for kids and how to give ideal age related gifts for more ideas be aware of what s not considered safe this season it s a really good idea to keep an eye on a consumer watchdog site to find out which toys have been recalled recently so that you can avoid buying them many consumer groups and government entities will send free email updates to your in box alerting you to recalls and it only takes a few minutes to glance through them if you re not sure contact them for more information about specific product recalls before seeking to purchase the product read the warnings and safety precautions accompanying the toy these will give you a good idea of suitability and safety issues for the child in question this requires some contextual thinking on your behalf given your knowledge of the child for example the warning may indicate to you that a child who is quiet and still will use the toy sensibly while a child who is restless always taking things apart and is prone to throwing things might misuse the toy other things to bear in mind when reading the warnings and safety precautions include small pieces toys with small pieces are always unsuitable for children under 3 even if you re purchasing the gift for an older child if there is a sibling under 3 can you be certain that the younger sibling won t have access to the toy fire hazards if your home has hazards such as open fires old and open radiator heaters etc think twice before purchasing flammable toys adult supervision if a safety precaution suggests that the toy requires adult supervision are you able to ensure that supervision in your household or do you know for sure it ll happen if giving the gift to another household for example a toy like the easy bake oven needs adult supervision and assistance with the cooking is that something you re willing to do every time your child wants to play with it and are you able to ensure that your child won t try to use it when you re not about for example by storing it away etc sharp edges not only young children can experience problems with sharp edges but so can older children if they have a marked history of hurting themselves avoid giving toys with sharp edges to young children under any circumstances and for older children be alert to how they normally interact with their toys fake food gifts for children some fake food gifts are very dangerous because the children mistake them for food and try to consume them for example glass candies are enticing because they re pretty but they re dangerous if a child bites one the only fake foods that are suitable for children are those marked clearly as made for children using non toxic materials and sized accurately for the age group toxic items avoid any toys that should be non toxic but are not check the labels items such as crayons bath products markers paints facepaint etc should be non toxic read the instructions accompanying any toys do they make sense are they clear are you left with any questions if you cannot understand the instructions and the retailer isn t able to help you out put the toy back on the shelf and let the retailer know that you don t consider the instructions adequately clear to ensure the toy s safe use you might also write the manufacturer if you think this would help ensure clearer instructions for other purchasers read all tags that are attached to stuffed animals most stuffed toys are restricted to ages three and up because they usually contain small pieces that a child can choke on if removed such as eyes noses embellishments and so forth if you re giving a stuffed toy to a child who is an infant or under two please be sure that the animal is smaller in height and mass than the child and that it is specifically labeled as suitable for a small child examine the pictures of toys on boxes the pictures can help provide you with an idea of the suitability of a toy along with the age group indicator knowing the child in question use the pictures to discern the appropriateness of the toy and how safe it will be when given to the recipient for example a plastic brick building product might contain small pieces that a kid could place in his or her mouth and you might need to ask the retailer for a similar product that is more suitable for the younger age group avoid getting anything that has excess string or cords such as slingshots never consider bb guns as toys for kids not only are these not kid s toys they can take out an eye all too easily and leave the victim blinded equally avoid buying toys that shoot off or send off pieces buy for durability with small children durability is essential check that the item cannot be broken easily and ask what happens if the item is broken you want to avoid any toy or product that breaks into shards splinters sharp pieces or releases anything toxic if purchasing sunglasses for a small child be sure that the lenses are approved for children and can withstand the pressure of being twisted chewed and sat on inspect all gifts as children open them if the gift s are from someone outside the family for example a neighbor or schoolmate it s a good idea to inspect the gift quickly to ensure that it s safe to play with if you discover that it isn t distract your child with another gift and try to either remedy the unsafe aspect such as removing small pieces or quickly replacing it with something else more suitable if there are tears tell your child that the toy needs repair or safekeeping for later and return to distracting him or her with the many other toys he or she has no doubt received or go and play somewhere else together take allergies and food or chemical sensitivities into account when purchasing gifts for any age group both children and adults can be allergic or highly sensitive to a range of food gifts especially such food as nuts msg infused food chocolate and so forth ask them if you don t already know and avoid purchasing such food items as gifts other gift items that can cause allergies or sensitivities include perfumes scented products and essential oils avoid giving nuts toffees and other hard candies to young children as gifts they can become choking hazards and are not good gifts for children under 5 if in doubt don t purchase a gift that has potential allergy or sensitivity issues take time to explain how to use the toy or gift to a child or to anyone who needs instruction if your kid is aware how to use the toy properly and is aware of how easily it can be broken or ruined then they are alerted to taking care of it in advance remove all broken toys and gifts immediately if they cannot be fixed safely dispose of them or recycle them where appropriate ask all gift recipients to be conscious of where they ve placed their gifts after opening them if it s a family event such as christmas a lot of things happen when there is a family gathering and family members and friends might feel tempted to leave opened gifts in places that are easily accessible to a child if you don t want to ask them at least do a sweep of the present opening room before leaving it to attend to other activities and put all small and child unsafe gifts out of reach be sure to let guests and family members know what you ve done with their goodies keep this in mind also if there are pets that may have access to the gift opening room while it is unattended don t leave anything laying around that could be dangerous to fido or fluffy in any way,Holidays-and-Traditions

how to observe safe toys and gifts month,for many cultures and beliefs december is a time when gifts are given in abundance to celebrate to congratulate and to show gratitude for people we spend time with the safety and age appropriateness of gifts isn t always uppermost in the gift purchaser s mind though mostly because we trust that the retailer is providing items that are already certified as safe and also because sometimes we re not totally clued into the needs or age specific particulars of the gift recipients in the united states december is observed as safe toys and gifts month as a means for alerting us to the need to be careful when making our toy and gift choices and to prompt us to keep in mind their safety and suitability knowing what to look out for can make a big difference in preventing possible injuries from well intentioned gifts this article provides an overview of the things to bear in mind when shopping for those toys and gifts,buy age appropriate toys children soon let you know if you ve purchased them a toy that s below their age group and most shoppers take great care to avoid such a slip up yet strangely we re prone to thinking that purchasing toys that are meant for an older age group is fine as if somehow it s suggesting that the child in question is smarter than their age group already or they ll grow into it the problem is that toys are age graded for safety reasons as much as for avoiding frustration and undesirability many toys aimed at older children contain small pieces which could be swallowed by a younger child toys for older children can also contain items that require responsible handling for example the popular beyblade battle tops would be appropriate for an 11 year old but not for a six year old video games have age ratings for a reason observe them read how to choose age appropriate gifts for kids and how to give ideal age related gifts for more ideas be aware of what s not considered safe this season it s a really good idea to keep an eye on a consumer watchdog site to find out which toys have been recalled recently so that you can avoid buying them many consumer groups and government entities will send free email updates to your in box alerting you to recalls and it only takes a few minutes to glance through them if you re not sure contact them for more information about specific product recalls before seeking to purchase the product read the warnings and safety precautions accompanying the toy these will give you a good idea of suitability and safety issues for the child in question this requires some contextual thinking on your behalf given your knowledge of the child for example the warning may indicate to you that a child who is quiet and still will use the toy sensibly while a child who is restless always taking things apart and is prone to throwing things might misuse the toy other things to bear in mind when reading the warnings and safety precautions include small pieces toys with small pieces are always unsuitable for children under 3 even if you re purchasing the gift for an older child if there is a sibling under 3 can you be certain that the younger sibling won t have access to the toy fire hazards if your home has hazards such as open fires old and open radiator heaters etc think twice before purchasing flammable toys adult supervision if a safety precaution suggests that the toy requires adult supervision are you able to ensure that supervision in your household or do you know for sure it ll happen if giving the gift to another household for example a toy like the easy bake oven needs adult supervision and assistance with the cooking is that something you re willing to do every time your child wants to play with it and are you able to ensure that your child won t try to use it when you re not about for example by storing it away etc sharp edges not only young children can experience problems with sharp edges but so can older children if they have a marked history of hurting themselves avoid giving toys with sharp edges to young children under any circumstances and for older children be alert to how they normally interact with their toys fake food gifts for children some fake food gifts are very dangerous because the children mistake them for food and try to consume them for example glass candies are enticing because they re pretty but they re dangerous if a child bites one the only fake foods that are suitable for children are those marked clearly as made for children using non toxic materials and sized accurately for the age group toxic items avoid any toys that should be non toxic but are not check the labels items such as crayons bath products markers paints facepaint etc should be non toxic read the instructions accompanying any toys do they make sense are they clear are you left with any questions if you cannot understand the instructions and the retailer isn t able to help you out put the toy back on the shelf and let the retailer know that you don t consider the instructions adequately clear to ensure the toy s safe use you might also write the manufacturer if you think this would help ensure clearer instructions for other purchasers read all tags that are attached to stuffed animals most stuffed toys are restricted to ages three and up because they usually contain small pieces that a child can choke on if removed such as eyes noses embellishments and so forth if you re giving a stuffed toy to a child who is an infant or under two please be sure that the animal is smaller in height and mass than the child and that it is specifically labeled as suitable for a small child examine the pictures of toys on boxes the pictures can help provide you with an idea of the suitability of a toy along with the age group indicator knowing the child in question use the pictures to discern the appropriateness of the toy and how safe it will be when given to the recipient for example a plastic brick building product might contain small pieces that a kid could place in his or her mouth and you might need to ask the retailer for a similar product that is more suitable for the younger age group avoid getting anything that has excess string or cords such as slingshots never consider bb guns as toys for kids not only are these not kid s toys they can take out an eye all too easily and leave the victim blinded equally avoid buying toys that shoot off or send off pieces buy for durability with small children durability is essential check that the item cannot be broken easily and ask what happens if the item is broken you want to avoid any toy or product that breaks into shards splinters sharp pieces or releases anything toxic if purchasing sunglasses for a small child be sure that the lenses are approved for children and can withstand the pressure of being twisted chewed and sat on inspect all gifts as children open them if the gift s are from someone outside the family for example a neighbor or schoolmate it s a good idea to inspect the gift quickly to ensure that it s safe to play with if you discover that it isn t distract your child with another gift and try to either remedy the unsafe aspect such as removing small pieces or quickly replacing it with something else more suitable if there are tears tell your child that the toy needs repair or safekeeping for later and return to distracting him or her with the many other toys he or she has no doubt received or go and play somewhere else together take allergies and food or chemical sensitivities into account when purchasing gifts for any age group both children and adults can be allergic or highly sensitive to a range of food gifts especially such food as nuts msg infused food chocolate and so forth ask them if you don t already know and avoid purchasing such food items as gifts other gift items that can cause allergies or sensitivities include perfumes scented products and essential oils avoid giving nuts toffees and other hard candies to young children as gifts they can become choking hazards and are not good gifts for children under 5 if in doubt don t purchase a gift that has potential allergy or sensitivity issues take time to explain how to use the toy or gift to a child or to anyone who needs instruction if your kid is aware how to use the toy properly and is aware of how easily it can be broken or ruined then they are alerted to taking care of it in advance remove all broken toys and gifts immediately if they cannot be fixed safely dispose of them or recycle them where appropriate ask all gift recipients to be conscious of where they ve placed their gifts after opening them if it s a family event such as christmas a lot of things happen when there is a family gathering and family members and friends might feel tempted to leave opened gifts in places that are easily accessible to a child if you don t want to ask them at least do a sweep of the present opening room before leaving it to attend to other activities and put all small and child unsafe gifts out of reach be sure to let guests and family members know what you ve done with their goodies keep this in mind also if there are pets that may have access to the gift opening room while it is unattended don t leave anything laying around that could be dangerous to fido or fluffy in any way,Holidays-and-Traditions

related issues observing this month long event can be done as an individual group class or family,talk with your kids teens and young adult children getting the word across to your kids or teenagers about alcohol usage is very important many parents don t realize what their kids do after school at a friend s house or at a party teen peer pressure is one of the top reasons why kids start to drink it is important to help your kids understand that alcohol is something to be had in moderation and not to be used either as a crutch for problems or as a social lubricant substitute for good conversation skills there are set legal ages for drinking alcohol in most countries around the world help children teens and young adults to understand that the reason for these laws is to protect them not to deprive them it s not an easy sell but if they understand the facts it can help considerably explain that some people use alcohol to relieve stress only to find it causes more stress help your children and teens to know the difference between a celebratory drink and drinking that is used as a way to overcome unhappiness worries or lack of confidence find more constructive ways to help your children and teens overcome these negative feelings such as confidence building and exercising to release stress talk about how alcohol can consume a person s daily life causing an addict to allow everything to revolve around alcohol instead of leading a normal healthy life alcoholism can also lead to arguments and violence for teens and older explain the statistics of deaths and injuries caused by alcohol on the roads at parties and so forth as relevant to your country reality hits hard but it s best they know than pretend that alcohol isn t going to cause them harm help children and teens to understand that it s not just about themselves but about their friends their family and about other people who might be harmed by another person s alcohol consumption show by good example the manner in which you use or abuse alcohol will have a big impact on your children s attitude toward it are you showing them appropriate values toward alcohol teach your teens what the recommended intake of alcohol is for your country it varies so that when they re old enough to consume alcohol legally they re aware of the limits for good health avoid over consumption of alcohol at parties pubs and other social drinking occasions stick to your daily limit and then switch to other non alcoholic choices spiced up with great conversation and fun games like pool darts or joke telling have fun with mock drinks or sparkling cider help others who would like to enjoy parties without having to seem drunk show that it s still possible to enjoy a get together without imbibing too much alcohol if alcohol is on the drink list have a system of taking away vehicle keys of guests as they step in the door never let a drunk even tipsy person drive even if they promise they re okay if it s necessary call a taxi or cab and have them pick their car up in the morning get employees who sell alcohol to double check the age depending upon the law of the country or state a business or owner may be fined if the purchase of alcohol is sold to a minor bouncers cashiers and bartenders should double check and verify the actual birth date along with the current photo on the i d if there is no i d or the i d appears suspicious then no alcohol should be sold know the effects of alcohol when pregnant fetal disorders may include low birth weight prematurity birth defects and even death miscarriage or stillborn never mix alcohol with pregnancy having a glass of wine is not a substitute or an excuse for needing some even the amount of caffeine taken should be monitored and in moderation but alcohol is definitely best left out of the pregnant woman s daily intake speak to your doctor for precise advice on the matter if you re pregnant recognize if you re drinking too much sometimes we fall into drinking more alcohol than we ever intended due to stressful jobs or home lives or through peer pressure to keep up if you find yourself drunk and hungover a lot and others have been telling you to ease up then it s time to face reality use this month to learn more about the effects of alcohol long term as well as the obvious short term impacts on your life and to start minimizing your alcohol intake if you say that you re drinking too much and think you don t drink more than anyone else but your friends and family are worried about your drinking and you ve had mishaps when drunk you may be in denial listen to what others have to say and seek help realize that this isn t affecting just you but is also affecting others around you convince your loved ones to seek advice if they re suffering from a drinking problem such as addiction to alcohol or rage brought on by drinking go with a loved one who has an alcohol problem to an aa alcoholics anonymous group session or any similar treatment program that matches your needs anything that is said within a therapy or group session room stays in that room with aa anyone can remain anonymous as the sharing of names is fully optional group sessions make people feel more comfortable because no one is alone in the world they understand that there is another person dealing with the issue and they can find ways and suggestions to help one another be supportive but not judgmental or enabling of any loved one who has problems with alcohol let them know that you care about them and that you re a ready shoulder to lean on but that you won t tolerate the continuance of the self harm and harm to others through their drinking habit look after yourself if you re living with an alcoholic you may be worried all the time which can drain you of energy if you re a victim of alcohol caused violence seek immediate help and safety while it might be the alcohol talking be well aware that the alcohol isn t doing any listening either so protect yourself and your children above all partners of heavy drinkers can feel intensely embarrassed and ashamed and may withdraw from public life when help is most needed if this is your experience seek help through family friends your doctor or local hospital or aa teach and educate in school teachers and other guidance counselors can educate teenagers in school about alcohol abuse and the effects of it because this observance is for a month create projects essays or lesson plans about it make brochures and other flyers relating to the daily lesson plan and have the students share what they re learning with peers and family members teach children assertiveness and confidence skills as skills these are completely teachable and doable by each student having confidence and feeling assertive will remove the temptation to use alcohol as a crutch in difficult or testing social situations teach children not to bottle up their feelings this leads to explosiveness and can lead to turning to the bottle too catch children at risk of or suffering from anxiety depression low self esteem and self hurting these children may turn to alcohol to cope the sooner they get help the more

for carrying things in and recycle your plastic bags buy or make earth friendly cleaning products try making up a simple vinegar and water counter cleaner or swapping out your bleach cleaner for a less toxic orange based one making your own cleaning products saves money and packaging homemade cleaning products also often work just as well as of industrial strength chemicals a solution of half vinegar half water can be used to clean floors bathrooms cabinets counters and just about anything else in your home to remove stains from carpeting clothing or other fabrics make a paste with baking soda and water let it sit on the stain for a few minutes then scrub it away with a toothbrush entertain kids with homemade crafts and toys instead of using store bought toys help kids appreciate the beauty of reusing something old to make it fun and new tell kids to get creative and come up with their own ideas for how to make something around the house into a toy here are a few ideas build a birdhouse or make a bird feeder to encourage the local bird population which plays an important role in every ecosystem turn used guitar strings into a centerpiece make a basket from an old orange juice carton convert an old floppy disk into a starship enterprise wear a skirt made out of old umbrellas sell or donate used items instead of throwing them away hold a garage sale donate or reuse household items many of us take up a lot of natural resources with stuff we don t really need want or use ironically there s a still lot of people who don t have basic necessities plus a lot of your unwanted clutter can be used by local charities to resell for much needed cash another idea is to hold a clothing swap this can be a fun free way for friends relatives co workers neighbors and the like to find new wardrobe finds you can combine with an earth day lunch or dinner too learn about product exchange communities like freecycle and other alternatives start a compost bin 13 x research source instead of throwing out your food scraps turn them into the soil for your garden this process is called composting banana peels egg shells carrot tops and avocado skins don t belong in the trash where they ll just end up in a landfill to start composting collect all of your food scraps except for meat and dairy products in a closed bin add leaves sticks grass clippings and other organic items to the mix turn the mixture every few days using a pitchfork the compost will break down into a rich brown soil after several months of turning consider buying a carbon offset this is designed to make up for the greenhouse gas emissions you create on the other 364 days of the year 14 x research source carbon offsets fund reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through projects such as wind farms that displaces energy from fossil fuels ride your bike use your bicycle or other forms of human powered transportation to commute to work or school and to run errands this is a lot more environmentally friendly than relying on cars to get wherever you re going if your school or work is too far to bike look for a form of public transportation you can take a bus train or shuttle is better for the environment than driving alone in your car or consider carpooling with a few friends who are going in the same direction conserve water in your house do you tend to use more water than

how to participate in a beach cleanup,collecting trash from beaches can be done as an individual or family as a group or collective or as part of a special event such as international coastal cleanup day world oceans day or as a class group and school being regularly aware of the need to keep all coasts clean and beautiful is one way that each and every one of us can help improve the state of the beach shoreline and duns and to ensure that these environments continue to serve as places both people and wildlife can use safely,take a spare rubbish bag with you whenever you visit the beach take along a garden glove also if you don t want to pick up anything by hand or a mechanical grabber in case you spot syringes and other nasty things on the beach make it part of your beach visit to collect at least 5 minutes worth of rubbish off the beach before you leave always dispose of your rubbish bag in a proper place of disposal if you cannot find a proper bin near the beach take the rubbish home and dispose of it using your own waste disposal methods encourage each family member to do the same while showing by example also encourage them to do the same teach children how to safely pick up rubbish without harming themselves if an area is known for drug use don t have children picking up rubbish for yourself wear solid shoes to avoid getting an accidental needlestick injury and wear proper gloves and carry mechanical litter pick up devices teach children to never stick their fingers inside anything be it a container shell or whatever else that creates a possible hiding spot for an animal that might sting bite or shoot barbs some animals such as the blue ringed octopus live inside human rubbish like drink cans and can deliver a fatal bite or sting if handled unawares look for local conservation groups who run regular beach cleanups join up and be a regular volunteer helping to keep your local beach clean attend their meetings to learn more about what they re doing where they re focusing and for rubbish collection tips participate in special events aimed at cleaning up the coastline there are several special events every year targeted at caring for the ocean the shoreline beaches and other seaside related areas some of these activities may include replanting sea grasses or dune grasses to help conserve the dunes and shoreline and to provide fish breeding habitats so it s not all about rubbish get involved when there s an oil spill when oil spills happen they inevitably end up on shore killing wildlife and harming the beach environment you can often become part of the cleanup operations by joining groups that need and train volunteers in cleaning birds cleaning the sand and other helpful ways of cleaning up check the websites of local conservation organizations and local government environment sites for details specific to the event as it happens encourage others to help keep the beach clean inform people where the rubbish bin is when you see them throw litter on the beach encourage people you know to get involved with beach cleanup events even often to drive them there or to buddy up with them volunteer some of your time to help shepherd school students doing beach cleanups you can explain to them what to do and keep an eye on their progress to help out the teachers bringing them to the event help others who clean up beaches by making donations most societies organizations and groups that clean up beaches need funds and help at all times so your donations of time and money will always be appreciated take food in reusable containers have a picnic or a barbecue at the beach but make it one where everything you take goes back home with you and you leave no trace of your meal this can be a reward after a beach cleanup especially for a group but make sure everyone understands the importance of bringing along sustainable food and eating gear,Holidays-and-Traditions

with your child and help them navigate the activities ask your children questions after you read color or peruse an earth or environmental website use the socratic method to find out what they understand about earth day issues starting a conversation with your children will familiarize them with green vocabulary open up communication lines so that they are more likely to comprehend earth day activities for example you may want to ask children about the other animals that share the local areas and global wilderness with us you can ask them about weather such as rain and sun you can ask them if they know where materials come from such as glass plastic aluminum or paper look through the book or website ahead of time to determine what questions will be the most useful to help assess and enhance their knowledge of the earth spend time outside in a natural setting if you live in a city or the suburbs plan a trip to a nature preserve wooded area or large park children can learn with all their senses if you discuss the earth or read a book about the earth in a place where they can witness proof of the plants and animals that rely on it the earth day network reported that 90 percent of children s playtime in america is spent indoors changing this percentage is likely to make your children more aware of their environment the more time you devote to discovery in a natural setting the more likely your children are to take an interest in protecting nature consider taking nature walks visiting an aquarium flying kites or swimming in an outdoor pool or lake go on a photo shoot give your child a camera that they can easily use after explaining an earth day theme ask them to explore a natural area and take pictures of things that remind them of what you talked about when they are finished make a photo collage online or in a scrapbook add to the scrapbook every year around earth day encourage children to write their own poem or essay about the earth give them a theme chosen from this year s earth day celebration and allow them to use their creativity choose earth day topics and activities based on the age of your children children are able to comprehend things more fully as they get older the following guidelines may be helpful in deciding what topics you should address pre schoolers require fairly simple concrete ideas ideas such as saving water planting flowers recycling or cleaning up trash outside works better than more abstract ideas like species extinction or climate change teach children aged 5 to 11 can take on more complex projects they may still thrive on simple earth day activities they can also go deeper into ideas and do more complex ideas for instance they can measure how much water a bath takes versus a shower or learn the finer points of gardening or calculate how much money they will earn by redeeming 25 soda cans pre teens and teenagers can get deeper into sciences activism and community service projects they can also be more self directed choosing interests and connecting them with the world as a whole for example your fashion savvy teen can look into purchasing summer clothing from companies that use sustainable materials and processes or upcycle thrift store finds to reduce waste or perhaps take old concert t shirts and create fun throw pillows rather than throw them out make and set goals as a family if a family decides they want to reduce car use then make sure everyone has a bicycle scooter or other alternative transportation source plan to take shorter showers and time everyone for a week or turn off lights and create a fine jar for any family member who does not engage in reuse or recycling craft projects choose a project that is easy to accomplish for the child s skill level the following are great craft options go through your recycling bins to look for containers such as tin cans that can be used as flower planters find soil and seeds to plant and grow your own herbs flowers or vegetables egg shells and milk bottles can also be used when their tops are removed encourage children to bring a little of the outdoors indoors have them gather rocks and paint them for paper weights you can also make ornaments out of pine cones or cover them in peanut butter or seeds for bird feeders make a paper mache globe by gathering newspaper and other paper from the recycling bins mix up a batch of paper mache glue with household materials use a blown up balloon for the center once the project is dry paint it with land and water using non toxic paint make a recyclers relay at a child s earth day party find aluminum plastic and other materials and give each child a bag full of mixed recycling give prizes to the fastest and most accurate recyclers it is ok to keep it simple even for teenagers picking up trash at the beach is a simple activity but it is appropriate for nearly all ages so is gardening or shopping at a secondhand store or going for a bicycle ride in fact there is a powerful message when families and communities do simple acts together to help the environment,Holidays-and-Traditions

energy usage your consuming habits and your reliance on unsustainable products and make a list of ways you intend to curb your unsustainable activities and habits and replace them with sustainable ones set yourself a timeline to meet with harder changes coming at the end of the timeline for instance consider eating meat free meals twice a week you could also make a point of turning off lights and electronics when not in use another idea is to commit yourself to walking to work or the market as often as possible choose to purchase sustainable organic or fair trade goods read the labels of origin and manufacture of your goods and decide if you can make better choices find out if your products are certified as sustainable organic locally made or fair trade there are lots of things a label can tell you if you choose to read it sustainable products include those that are sustainably obtained for example all forest products with the fsc logo are logged using sustainable forestry practices organic products such as cotton clothing cause much less environmental damage than non organic methods such as conventional cotton growing practices locally made products decrease the impact on the environment because they travel less miles which means less emissions to make it to the consumer fair trade products are ethically produced and take into account the native people as well as the environmental resources in the areas they are produced if you can t find a label email or post a message on facebook to the company retailer or manufacturer responsible for the product facebook is a great method because lots of other people will check out your question and be waiting for the answer take public transportation to reduce your environmental impact make a choice to use public transportation more often than you do already to cut back on the amount of noxious fumes introduced into the environment carpooling is also a great way to reduce emissions you can also ride your bicycle or walk to close destinations get involved in a conservation restoration or eco community project today is a great day to sign up and get involved with people who are doing rather than talking or reading sign up to help restore an old building in town or join a local water conservation group plan your garden space to include edible items if you have a yard or garden that sits empty make a plan to plant fruits veggies and herbs for personal use or even bee friendly flowers growing your own food helps reduce strain on the environment things you can do that will make the most of your garden include compost your scraps use this compost to boost the garden s production create a part of it that is edible and plant seasonal crops for those of you with merely a balcony or a tiny plot you can still grow food such as a potato in a bag and small sprout gardens in your windowsill you could also join a community gardening project grow herbs and spices that add flavor to your food look beautiful in the garden and that also have medicinal beauty healing spiritual or other uses borrow a book from the library to learn more about herb and spice use these plants don t need much space and they can be grown on a windowsill or balcony encourage beneficial and friendly wildlife to your garden through careful planting and shelter creation learn to make your own garden sprays using items that are toxic to bugs and mildew but not to people and pets refuse reduce reuse and recycle refuse to buy unsustainable products reduce your consumption reuse items and materials around your home and recycle everything you can all that clutter has to go somewhere so make a choice not to bring in into the house to begin with and if it has to leave make good choices about where it s going to end up 8 x research source think about borrowing sharing donating time sharing etc instead of buying for keeps or pass it on after you ve read used watched worn enjoyed it,Holidays-and-Traditions

organic getting rid of pests the old fashioned way can actually be more effective than using pesticides try planting native plants to control the insect population use water to spray common insects like aphids off of your vegetable plants when it comes to weeds pulling them out by hand works better than any other method commit to protecting local wild places whether you live near an ocean river forest mountain swamp or lake wild areas like these need protection they are home to many plants and animals who rely on them for food and shelter on earth day commit to protecting the wild places in your community by doing the following join a group working to protect these areas from pollution and developments encourage people to respect wild spaces by not damaging animal habitats littering and dumping in the water clean up litter in your community many groups use the weekend of earth day to clear roadways highways and neighborhood streets of litter that has accumulated since the last clean up day 9 x research source many companies donate gloves and bags for clean up groups and villages organize bag pickups once the group has collected the trash and placed the recycled bags along the road get the village public works department to pick the bags up it s a wonderful community project that you can do as an individual or with a group eat food from local sources eating food that was grown or raised as close to your home as possible is important for a variety of reasons locally grown food doesn t require as much gas to arrive in your town and end up on the shelves in your grocery store the closer to your home it was grown the more environmentally friendly it is 10 x research source farmer s markets are a great place to find local foods most foods available in farmer s markets were grown within a 50 mile vicinity some grocery stores have a section devoted to locally grown foods look for foods that were produced in your state or better yet within 50 miles of your town look for foods that were produced on small farms rather than manufactured at factories plant a vegetable garden when it comes to eating local you can t get much closer to home than your own yard you can grow a lot of different vegetables in a relatively small space earth day falls during the perfect time of year to plant a garden try clearing a bit of grass away and planting a few different varieties to try out during the summer squash is a great choice since one plant produces enough to feed a small family for several weeks tomatoes is popular among novice gardeners beans are relatively low maintenance herbs take up very little room and can be grown in pots don t have space for a garden see if there s a community garden in your area where you can start using a plot consider a vegetarian or vegan diet most meat is manufactured in an industrial setting under conditions that pollute the environment and are cruel to the animals 11 x research source mass produced meat is normally pumped full of hormones making it unhealthy for humans to consume eliminating meat from your diet is considered a great way to do your part to help the environment why not make april 22 your first meatless day a vegetarian diet is free of meat and fish while a vegan diet is free of all animal products including eggs honey and dairy products choose the diet that works best for your health needs if you don t want to give up meat entirely consider buying your meat products only from local farms where you know how the animals were treated look for farms that allow animals space to roam and feed them healthy food 12 x research source cook from scratch pre made processed foods require preservatives and a lot of packaging to keep them from going bad before you eat them check out the list of ingredients on items like frozen dinners packaged snack foods and other common grocery store items they likely contain extra sugars chemical flavorings and other ingredients that aren t good for the environment or our bodies the solution is to buy foods in their natural form and cook from scratch even if a product is labeled natural check the ingredients if you see words you can t pronounce you probably don t need to eat it not sure you know how to cook from scratch start with easy dishes like omelets casseroles smoothies or steamed vegetables once you learn some basic techniques you ll be able to cook more and more dishes from scratch reduce reuse and recycle buy as little as possible and avoid items that come in lots of packaging start good habits on earth day and carry them through all year long here are a few ways you can reduce reuse and recycle support local growers and producers of food and products these don t have to travel as far and so reduce greenhouse gas emissions take your drink container with you and don t use any disposable plates or cutlery recycle all the things you do use for the day or find other uses for things that you no longer use carry a cloth bag for carrying things in and recycle your plastic bags buy or make earth friendly cleaning products try making up a simple vinegar and water counter cleaner or swapping out your bleach cleaner for a less toxic orange based one making your own cleaning products saves money and packaging homemade cleaning products also often work just as well as of industrial strength chemicals a solution of half vinegar half water can be used to clean floors bathrooms cabinets counters and just about anything else in your home to remove stains from carpeting clothing or other fabrics make a paste with baking soda and water let it sit on the stain for a few minutes then scrub it away with a toothbrush entertain kids with homemade crafts and toys instead of using store bought toys help kids appreciate the beauty of reusing something old to make it fun and new tell kids to get creative and come up with their own ideas for how to make something around the house into a toy here are a few ideas build a birdhouse or make a bird feeder to encourage the local bird population which plays an important role in every ecosystem turn used guitar strings into a centerpiece make a basket from an old orange juice carton convert an old floppy disk into a starship enterprise wear a skirt made out of old umbrellas sell or donate used items instead of throwing them away hold a garage sale donate or reuse household items many of us take up a lot of natural resources with stuff we don t really need want or use ironically there s a still lot of people who don t have basic necessities plus a lot of your unwanted clutter can be used by local charities to resell for much needed cash another idea is to hold a clothing swap this can be a fun free way for friends relatives co workers neighbors and the like to find new wardrobe finds you can combine with an earth day lunch or dinner too learn about product exchange communities like freecycle and other alternatives start a compost bin 13 x research source instead of throwing out your food scraps turn them into the soil for your garden this process is called composting banana peels egg shells carrot tops and avocado skins don t belong in the trash where they ll just end up in a landfill to start composting collect all of your food scraps except for meat and dairy products in a closed bin add leaves sticks grass clippings and other organic items to the mix turn the mixture every few days using a pitchfork the compost will break down into a rich brown soil after several months of turning consider buying a carbon offset this is designed to make up for the greenhouse gas emissions you create on the other 364 days of the year 14 x research source carbon offsets fund reductions in greenhouse gas emissions through projects such as wind farms that displaces energy from fossil fuels ride your bike use your bicycle or other forms of human powered transportation to commute to work or school and to run errands this is a lot more environmentally friendly than relying on cars to get wherever you re going if your school or work is too far to bike look for a form of public transportation you can take a bus train or shuttle is better for the environment than driving alone in your car or consider carpooling with a few friends who are going in the same direction conserve water in your house do you tend to use more water than you need while going about your daily chores and business there are little things you can do that make a big difference in how much water you use plus conserving water will keep your water bill down 15 x trustworthy source united states environmental protection agency independent u s government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices go to source try adopting these habits while brushing your teeth or washing your hands turn the water off when not in use turn the water off when you are brushing if you are washing your hands turn the water off when you are scrubbing your hands with soap take shorter showers every day from earth day on install a greywater system in your home recycle water from the house for the garden wash your car using a bucket rather than the hose drive the car onto the grass for cleaning so that the water you do use also waters the grass save electricity it s one of the first ways many of us are taught to be environmentally friendly yet we all need help remembering how important it is to do things like turn off the lights when you leave the room there are many ways you can save more electricity on a daily basis 16 x research source vow to use less air conditioning in the summer and less heat in the winter turn off all appliances and electronics when you aren t using them use energy saving light bulbs or install skylights on your house s roof you could also make mason jar luminaries as well switch to low energy appliances,Holidays-and-Traditions
how to celebrate environment day at school,world environment day wed is celebrated each year on june 5 like earth day it s a day to learn about the environment participate in conservation activities and learn about ways to help in the future to celebrate at school you can commune with nature create new environmental programs use nature centered lesson plans and work on earth centered activities,go on a nature hunt divide a sheet of paper into sections and label each section with something a student could observe outside such as trees flowers birds insects and mammals the students can then explore outside for a set period writing down what they observe in each category at the end discuss what you observed and talk about ways nature can be conserved clean up a local area cleaning up a local park or even the school s grounds can help students appreciate how important it is to conserve talk about why littering is harmful and how recycling can help 1 x research source grow an appreciation for nature by going on a hike have students go outside and observe nature you can even take a guided hike in a local park let the students get creative by encouraging them to write a poem story or song about what inspired them they can even just draw a picture 2 x research source have class outside a simple way to increase students love of nature is to hold class outside pick a nice shady area such as under a tree or pavilion and conduct class as you normally would the kids will love the change in environment 3 x research source set up a reuse program with the arts and crafts classes most art teachers love projects that reuse household items talk to your art teacher and figure out what they need then on wed work with the school to set up an area where items can be collected students teachers and staff can bring in items to be reused 4 x research source plant trees or a garden creating a little more green space in the world is a great way to celebrate wed ask a local nursery to donate trees and then plant them around the school as part of your wed celebration 5 x research source alternatively stake out an area to start a community garden you can grow food that students and teachers can take home or that can be used in the cafeteria begin a recycling program if you re school doesn t already have a recycling program wed is a great day to set one up designate an area for recycling and offer a program on how to recycle and why recycling is important 6 x research source connect students to local initiatives your community likely already has a number of ways that they are working to help the environment research ones that your students can help with talk to them about these programs you can even help them get connected by taking a field trip to one 7 x research source invite people to talk about nature and conservation you likely have a number of experts in your area who can talk about environmental issues invite them to come talk to your class or even an after school environmental club 8 x research source for instance you could invite someone who works for the local parks and recreation department or a person who works at the recycling center another good choice would be someone who works for a nature center or preserve or even the zoo talk about ways to conserve energy you can discuss things like turning off the lights when you leave a room turning up the ac a few degrees warmer doing laundry in cold water and unplugging devices when they re not being used you could also talk about making energy efficient choices in the home such as switching out incandescent bulbs for fluorescent bulbs or leds 9 x research source go on a field trip to a science or natural history museum connecting kids with science centers helps them learn about ways they can conserve plus most science museums will have special events for wed day 10 x research source watch a few professional videos videos are a great way to engage students in learning and you can find a large number of professional videos for kids on conservation for instance pbs has a nature section at http www pbs org wnet nature classroom create seed balls to spread around these are little balls filled with seeds you leave them in bare areas and the seeds will sprout leaving plants growing in the area use plants native to your area so you don t encourage new species that will try to take over 11 x research source mix 1 2 ounce 14 g of native wildflower seeds with 3 5 ounces 99 g of potting soil add in 1 5 ounces 43 g of dry clay such as red powdered pottery clay mix the ingredients together slowly add in water until you have a thick paste roll the paste into balls and let it dry on a cookie sheet covered in wax paper leave the balls in areas where the ground is bare the balls will break down and sprout plants when it rains turn old t shirts into bags have everyone bring in t shirts or buy enough thrift store t shirts for everyone cut the sleeves off the shirt and then cut around the inside of the neck the bits you have left at the top are the handles 12 x research source turn the shirt inside out mark a line across the bottom that s about 4 inches 10 cm up from the bottom cut strips that are 1 inch 2 5 cm wide by cutting up until you reach the line tie each set of 2 strips together one each from the front and the back then go back and tie each set together by taking one strand from one set and one from the next set and knotting them together turn the bag inside out again create bird feeders start with an empty toilet paper roll or paper towel roll poke a hole in both sides of the tube at the top and run a string through them tie the string above the roll using a butter knife coat the roll in peanut butter coat the tube in bird seed by rolling it in a plate filled with seed hang your bird feeder outside using the string 13 x research source make jump ropes from plastic bags start by making strips from plastic bags lay a bag out flat and cut the top off including the handles cut the bag horizontally into strips tie the strips together you ll need 12 long strips and they should be a bit longer than you want your jump rope to be tape 6 strips together on one end tape the 6 strips to the back of a chair and braid them together tape the other end do the same with the other 6 strips tape the other end pull them off the chair tape the 2 sets together on one end and then tape it back to the chair twist the 2 braids tightly together and then tape them together at the other end the tape forms the handles for the jump rope pull the taped end off the chair,Holidays-and-Traditions
how to organize a beach clean up,trash on the beach can be unsightly but when it washes into the ocean it becomes life threatening for marine wildlife and harmful to humans too if you re looking to make a difference hosting a beach clean up is a great way to make the ocean safe and pleasant for both animals and people you ll need to plan well and recruit volunteers that are just as passionate as you are but the clean beach you see afterwards will be worth it all,choose a beach that s convenient and in need of a clean up go online or check in with your local parks and recreation department to see what beaches are most in need of help you should also try to choose a spot that will be easy for volunteers to get to with restrooms and easy parking available pick a date that s in early spring or late fall the best time to plan your beach clean up is either right before summer beach going season or right afterwards so aim for a time around then if possible try to pick a day when your volunteers will be free like on a weekend and at a time when the beach will be empty like early in the morning 1 x research source consult a tide chart as well you can plan your clean up for when the tide is going out giving you more ground to cover and trash to remove get permission from local officials to hold your beach clean up if you want to hold your clean up at a public beach you may need to consult local parks and recreation offices about getting any permits that might be necessary they can also let you know whether the area will be closed for any reason on your planned date 2 x research source if you re not sure who to contact about permits and permissions call your local police station get volunteers by asking your network of friends and family ask all of your friends and family in the area if they d be willing to participate and post information on your social media as well ask your friends and family to spread the word to their friends coworkers and classmates to get even more participation 3 x research source check your permits to see how many volunteers are recommended and whether there s a limit try to aim for at least 10 participants make a facebook event so your volunteers can easily see event details and who else is going advertise through flyers and local newspapers if you want to broaden your outreach strategy to an even bigger audience put up flyers on bulletin boards at schools local businesses and parks you can also send a press release to local publications to get the word out even more 4 x research source some ocean conservation organizations offer cleanup flyer templates you can use and edit to fit your own needs to save paper you can email your flyer as an attachment to local businesses and institutions register your event with an organization to increase outreach go online to find ocean conservation organizations that you can register your beach clean up with they can offer resources to help you gather more volunteers and set up a successful clean up on the day of 5 x research source scout out the area a few days beforehand head to your clean up area 1 2 days in advance to plan out where you ll meet your volunteers and what areas you ll clean you should also figure out where you ll leave your full bags of trash and recyclables where your volunteers will park and if you ll need to post any signs to help them find you 6 x research source you might be able to throw your trash bags in nearby dumpsters or your local government agency might agree to come pick them up for you determine parking areas for your volunteers figure out the traffic patterns in the area by checking online traffic sites around the time you re planning on doing the clean up will there be lots of cars clogging up intersections how easy will it be for your volunteers to get in and out 7 x research source if the beach is supervised by your local city government ask if they have parking restrictions or recommendations if you think your volunteers will have trouble parking find alternative solutions walk around nearby neighborhoods and look for available street parking or ask your volunteers to carpool or take public transportation no matter what communication with your volunteers is key so they know what to expect load up on clean up supplies for your volunteers you can ask your volunteers to bring their own supplies but you can assume they won t have many of the necessary items order online or go to a local hardware or general store to get your supplies and make sure to buy enough so that each of your volunteers has the item make sure to buy things like 8 x research source recyclable canvas or burlap garbage bags biodegradable protective gloves sifters or rakes trash sticks sunscreen buy water and low waste snacks to keep volunteers energy up people will be much more excited to come to your event if they know that snacks will be provided bring along a full water cooler and ask them to bring their own reusable water bottles to fill up as a way to reduce waste 9 x research source look for healthy snacks that won t generate a lot of waste like fruit or big bags of granola crackers or popcorn instead of individually wrapped packets if you don t have the funds for food specify that volunteers should bring along their own snacks make sure to bring extra bags for volunteers to throw away their food waste organize an emergency plan just in case write up a list of police and hospital phone numbers and driving directions to have on hand and make sure that you can easily communicate with your whole group by cell phone or walkie talkie bring along a basic first aid kit as well so you can treat any cuts or bruises that volunteers may get 10 x research source tell volunteers not to in the water but try to have someone on hand that s been trained in emt and lifeguarding skills just in case you can also review what you should do in case of a health emergency like heatstroke or a broken bone you should also look over your site for safety hazards like rocks changing tides roads and power lines have your volunteers wear suitable protective clothing ask that your volunteers wear closed toe shoes that are waterproof if possible as well as extra layers like jackets in case it gets cold recommend that they bring sun protection like sunscreen hats and sunglasses since the sun reflecting off the water can intensify uv effects they can also bring their own protective gloves although you should have some on hand as well it s safe to assume that many of your volunteers won t have their own pair send out a reminder email 1 2 days before the event get in touch with all your volunteers a few days before the event to remind them of the date time and location this is also a great time to pass on important information like the weather outlook for the clean up day parking instructions and clothing recommendations tell your volunteers exactly where you ll meet them on the day of the clean up if it s not easy to find you could even provide a map or an exact address get to the site early arrive at least 30 minutes before your volunteers so you can prep your site set up a check in station post signs or posters and check out the weather to send out last minute updates this will give you plenty of time to prepare so that you re relaxed and ready to go by the time your volunteers arrive 11 x research source post signs to help volunteers find you put up signs with the name of your event in the parking area and the area where you ll meet your volunteers make sure they re big legible and securely fixed to tables or fences 12 x research source if you have a few latecomers and need to move to another location write a note on a sign to tell them where you re going or draw an arrow to show them where they can find you check volunteers in as they arrive set up a table with paper and pens for your volunteers to check in or simply pass around a clipboard as they arrive ask them to write down their full name email and phone number if you re working through a government or conservation organization you might also need them to sign health waivers you ll want their phone numbers in case you need to get in touch while at the clean up it s good to have their emails as well so you can send out follow up messages after the clean up is over give them instructions on where to clean up and what to pick up before your volunteers get started give them instructions on where they should pick up trash like any potentially hazardous areas to avoid as well as what they can expect to pick up and tips on how to do so safely make sure they re all wearing protective gloves and have trash sticks and trash bags to use your volunteers can expect to pick up materials like 13 x research source plastic bags bottles and cans fishing gear cigarettes helium balloons be careful of potentially hazardous items have your volunteers place dangerous materials in containers with tight screw on lids rather than trash bags this will keep them from poking through the material of a trash bag or leaking potentially dangerous fluids on other items some materials to look out for include 14 x research source syringes needles or medical vials pieces of broken glass electronics batteries tires paint split your group in 2 and have them start on opposite ends of the beach give each group several trash bags at least 1 for every 3 4 people and have them walk to opposite ends of the area you re cleaning they ll walk towards each other while cleaning ensuring that the whole beach is covered and that the group ends up together at the end 15 x research source for an added incentive you can set up a table of snacks and refreshments at the meeting point for the volunteers to enjoy when they finish have volunteers sort recycling from trash while they clean up ask your volunteers to sort out items that are recyclable in your area like plastic from materials that need to go to the landfill make sure each group has one designated recycling bag to make it easier 16 x research source you can mark the recycling bags with a label or get them in a different color weigh the trash with a hook scale if you can it can be rewarding for you and your volunteers to see just how much trash you picked up if you have a scale with a hook use it to weight your trash bags if not you can use a standard conversion of 15 pounds 6 8 kg per trash bag to estimate the the weight of the trash 17 x research source throw trash in a specified dumpster or container once your group has reassembled gather everyone s trash together in as few bags as you can take it to your designated disposal area whether that s a dumpster or an area where it can be picked up and taken to a landfill 18 x research source clean up your materials and any trash left behind you can invite your volunteers to stay for awhile to talk and enjoy refreshments but don t forget to clean up your materials and any last pieces of trash before you go ask your volunteers to help so it goes faster remember to grab any posters you put up in other areas as well take a picture of the whole group to post and share before your volunteers leave remember to get a group picture that you can share on social media or with press this is a great way of saying thank you to your volunteers while inspiring others with your clean up efforts decide on a designated hashtag for your event like pacificbeachcleanup2018 invite your clean up team to post their own pictures with the hashtag so you can easily find them send out a thank you text or email a day or so after your event send out a brief email or text thanking your volunteers for showing up and helping out this is a great way to show them your gratitude and remind them of the great impact they made 19 x research source you can also include a few details from your beach cleanup like how much trash you picked or the strangest piece of trash someone found,Holidays-and-Traditions
how to participate in a beach cleanup,collecting trash from beaches can be done as an individual or family as a group or collective or as part of a special event such as international coastal cleanup day world oceans day or as a class group and school being regularly aware of the need to keep all coasts clean and beautiful is one way that each and every one of us can help improve the state of the beach shoreline and duns and to ensure that these environments continue to serve as places both people and wildlife can use safely,take a spare rubbish bag with you whenever you visit the beach take along a garden glove also if you don t want to pick up anything by hand or a mechanical grabber in case you spot syringes and other nasty things on the beach make it part of your beach visit to collect at least 5 minutes worth of rubbish off the beach before you leave always dispose of your rubbish bag in a proper place of disposal if you cannot find a proper bin near the beach take the rubbish home and dispose of it using your own waste disposal methods encourage each family member to do the same while showing by example also encourage them to do the same teach children how to safely pick up rubbish without harming themselves if an area is known for drug use don t have children picking up rubbish for yourself wear solid shoes to avoid getting an accidental needlestick injury and wear proper gloves and carry mechanical litter pick up devices teach children to never stick their fingers inside anything be it a container shell or whatever else that creates a possible hiding spot for an animal that might sting bite or shoot barbs some animals such as the blue ringed octopus live inside human rubbish like drink cans and can deliver a fatal bite or sting if handled unawares look for local conservation groups who run regular beach cleanups join up and be a regular volunteer helping to keep your local beach clean attend their meetings to learn more about what they re doing where they re focusing and for rubbish collection tips participate in special events aimed at cleaning up the coastline there are several special events every year targeted at caring for the ocean the shoreline beaches and other seaside related areas some of these activities may include replanting sea grasses or dune grasses to help conserve the dunes and shoreline and to provide fish breeding habitats so it s not all about rubbish get involved when there s an oil spill when oil spills happen they inevitably end up on shore killing wildlife and harming the beach environment you can often become part of the cleanup operations by joining groups that need and train volunteers in cleaning birds cleaning the sand and other helpful ways of cleaning up check the websites of local conservation organizations and local government environment sites for details specific to the event as it happens encourage others to help keep the beach clean inform people where the rubbish bin is when you see them throw litter on the beach encourage people you know to get involved with beach cleanup events even often to drive them there or to buddy up with them volunteer some of your time to help shepherd school students doing beach cleanups you can explain to them what to do and keep an eye on their progress to help out the teachers bringing them to the event help others who clean up beaches by making donations most societies organizations and groups that clean up beaches need funds and help at all times so your donations of time and money will always be appreciated take food in reusable containers have a picnic or a barbecue at the beach but make it one where everything you take goes back home with you and you leave no trace of your meal this can be a reward after a beach cleanup especially for a group but make sure everyone understands the importance of bringing along sustainable food and eating gear,Holidays-and-Traditions
how to commute on earth day,earth day is a celebration of nature and its purpose is to help people commit to greener living if you want to make your commute greener on earth day try biking or taking public transportation as an added bonus many cities offer free public transportation on earth day you can also carpool with others or if you need to take your car make sure it s as efficient as possible for your commute,put your walking shoes on to get to work if your work is within walking distance this is a very green option just make sure you start out early enough so that you get to work on time you won t be able to use traffic as an excuse for being late 1 x research source if you don t want to wear your nice work clothes while walking consider bringing clothes and shoes you can change into when you get to work if you re worried about sweating through your clothes wear something light if you don t want to walk the whole way try walking to a bus stop or metro station ride your bike if it s a bit too far for walking biking can cut down on your leg work if walking doesn t seem feasible if you don t have a bike check to see if your city has a bike sharing program you may be able to borrow one for a small fee 2 x research source when biking to work make sure you know the rules to stay safe while riding in traffic in addition make sure you aren t wearing loose clothing that could catch in the bike and opt for flat footed shoes with good traction if you need to carry a backpack with clothes to change into when you get to work you could also use a powered scooter or segway you may be able to rent these around town as well hop on the subway for an easy to schedule fast route if you re lucky enough to have a metro system in your city try taking that to work for earth day check where your local stations are and what route you ll need to take online then walk or drive over to the station you may like it so much that you decide to take it at other times of the year too 3 x research source many cities also have apps to help you plan your route most subways also connect to the city s bus systems if the metro doesn t cover your whole route take the bus if your city doesn t have a metro system bus systems tend to take a bit longer but you ll still get to work check your local system to see what stops are nearby and what route you can take to work you may need to change buses at some point but don t worry one bus change is usually included in your fare hold on to your ticket to show the next bus driver 4 x research source often you ll need exact change to ride the bus so look the fare up online if you plan to ride more often consider getting a month by month bus pass ask if you can telecommute for a day the greenest commute is not to commute at all some employers may be amenable to the idea of you working from home for a day check with your boss a couple of weeks out to see if this is an option for you 5 x trustworthy source united states environmental protection agency independent u s government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices go to source you could also suggest a compressed work week where you work more on other days of the week and then don t come in on earth day talk to your coworkers about riding together ask around to see if any of your coworkers live near your home then see if they ll share a ride with you most people are willing to share as long as you re a little flexible 6 x research source you could even put out an email to see if you can connect other people for carpooling check with your neighbors to see if they have similar routes you already know your neighbors live close by so it makes sense to see if they work in the same part of town ask around and you may find someone to share a ride with on earth day as a bonus you may be able to share a ride with them more often once you both realize you have the same route you could also check into community events some cities offer local carpooling events where you can meet other people who may have your same route use a carpool matching service to find people to ride with you don t have to ride to work with coworkers you can find people who have similar commutes and share rides with them some cities have their own commuter websites but you can also find general websites to hook up with people who have similar routes 7 x research source try services like waze rideshare and ridefinders check with the service to see if the offer emergency ride homes if something happens with your carpool many will provide you with a ride home in another form 8 x research source opt for a ride share company that will let you include other riders ride sharing companies like lyft and uber will pick you up like a taxi would however they ll also connect you to other riders on your route if you choose the shared rides option it will only take a few minutes out of your way to include other people in your commute and you don t have to do any of the legwork to find people to share with 9 x research source just choose the shared rides option on lyft or the uberpool option on uber this option will also save you money but it can increase your commute time plan ahead take the junk out of your car believe it or not those water bottles you have rolling around in the back and the junk you have in the trunk of your car can add up lowering your fuel efficiency for every extra 100 pounds 45 kg you carry your car s efficiency goes down 2 10 x research source put that stuff in your home or recycle it inflate your tires for better fuel efficiency look in your car s manual to see the proper pressure for your tires then use a tire gauge to check your pressure if they don t have enough air add more until you reach the correct pressure 11 x research source many tire companies will check your air pressure for free you should really check it at least twice a year when the weather turns cold in the fall and when it turns hot in late spring to check the pressure take the cap off the nozzle on the tire place the tire gauge over the gap it will pop the end out which looks kind of like a ruler the number next to the end of the metal tube is your tire pressure you can add air at most gas stations slow down your speed to increase efficiency the faster you go the more fuel you burn you may want to speed a little if you re late to work but slowing down is much better for the environment 12 x trustworthy source united states environmental protection agency independent u s government agency responsible for promoting safe environmental practices go to source keep in mind most highways have minimum speeds so don t go below that using cruise control also helps as the car will adjust more efficiently than you will shift your commuting time to avoid traffic the more you sit in traffic the more fuel you burn try leaving 30 minutes to an hour earlier to see if that helps with traffic you may find you avoid most of it and make your commute more efficient you ll get to work early but that means you can get a head start 13 x trustworthy source united states environmental protection agency independent u s government

clean water if this is the case research an ocean setting that will address the theme and then plan your setting choose your diorama container choose between a shoe box a sardine tin or a cookie tin the container will determine the size of your diorama and how big its features should be sketch your diorama plan draw the container shape and sketch out possible shapes and creatures in pencil assign layers to your drawing including background mid level and foreground clean the container if you are using a box cut off the flaps and wipe out the inside with a tack cloth if you are using a tin wash it with soap and water and dry it completely trace the bottom of the container shape on your blue background paper it is easier to attach the paper to the back and sides of the diorama than to draw inside it cut out the background shape just inside the line so that it will fit inside easily trace the sides of the container with the same color of background paper cut them out and lay them aside draw an ocean scene on your background paper as depicted in your sketch you may choose to draw geographic features coral seaweed or tidal lines for extra definition draw these features on colored construction paper and glue them onto the background glue the background and side panels into your diorama use craft glue and smooth it into a thin layer with a popsicle stick press it gently into the inside of your box or tin and smooth it with your fingers add 3d objects to the bottom of your diorama for the mid level of your ocean scene your choices will depend upon what scene you are depicting the following are some popular ocean diorama ideas use green pipe cleaners for seaweed and pink or red pipe cleaners for coral you can twist the pipe cleaners gently to indicate swaying seaweed in a tide or to form coral shapes curl the pipe cleaner slightly on the end as though trying to make a stand for it then use a layer of craft glue to affix the cleaner to the bottom of the diorama gather rocks from a river bed or garden to use in a rocky ocean scene wash the rocks with soap and water to help them stick to your surface better after they are dry put a layer of craft glue on the bottom of the rock and stick it inside your diorama you can stack rocks if you want find small sea shells to glue on the diorama floor you can collect tiny shells at a beach or you may be able to find a small number of shells at a craft store in the beading section put a layer of glue over the remaining floor of your diorama using a paint brush drop layers of sand into the bottom to cover the glue shake off the remaining sand outside find plastic fish mammals or humans to use in your diorama some toy stores have a supply of aquatic creatures or action figures such as a scuba diver that you can easily place in a diorama this will increase the ease with which your diorama is built make your own creatures if you prefer draw fish whales crustaceans or people onto paper and cut them out trace the shape onto a thick piece of cardboard and cut the cardboard piece out with scissors or a utility knife glue the image onto the cardboard when it is dry glue it onto the back of your diorama as long as you use thick cardboard it will create a 3d look to your scene if you are not very good at drawing creatures then you can find them online search in the images section of your search engine to find and print out animals you would like to use hang plastic or cardboard creatures from the top of your diorama repeat the same process of making cardboard backed creatures but glue an image on either side of the cardboard use a needle to poke a hole in the top of the cardboard creature then poke the needle through the top of the diorama and tie a knot you can also hang plastic toys from the top of your diorama tie a piece of thread around them thread the needle and poke the needle through the ceiling of the diorama hanging parts of your ocean scene is a great way to create a lifelike foreground for your diorama things in the foreground can appear slightly larger and have some movement to them cover the top and sides of your diorama with a large piece of construction paper if you have many pieces of thread poking through the top choose a color like black that will distract the viewer from your diorama create a title for your earth day diorama write it on construction paper and cut it out or print it out on a word processing software program affix the title to the top or 1 of the front edges of your diorama,Holidays-and-Traditions

understand about earth day issues starting a conversation with your children will familiarize them with green vocabulary open up communication lines so that they are more likely to comprehend earth day activities for example you may want to ask children about the other animals that share the local areas and global wilderness with us you can ask them about weather such as rain and sun you can ask them if they know where materials come from such as glass plastic aluminum or paper look through the book or website ahead of time to determine what questions will be the most useful to help assess and enhance their knowledge of the earth spend time outside in a natural setting if you live in a city or the suburbs plan a trip to a nature preserve wooded area or large park children can learn with all their senses if you discuss the earth or read a book about the earth in a place where they can witness proof of the plants and animals that rely on it the earth day network reported that 90 percent of children s playtime in america is spent indoors changing this percentage is likely to make your children more aware of their environment the more time you devote to discovery in a natural setting the more likely your children are to take an interest in protecting nature consider taking nature walks visiting an aquarium flying kites or swimming in an outdoor pool or lake go on a photo shoot give your child a camera that they can easily use after explaining an earth day theme ask them to explore a natural area and take pictures of things that remind them of what you talked about when they are finished make a photo collage online or in a scrapbook add to the scrapbook every year around earth day encourage children to write their own poem or essay about the earth give them a theme chosen from this year s earth day celebration and allow them to use their creativity choose earth day topics and activities based on the age of your children children are able to comprehend things more fully as they get older the following guidelines may be helpful in deciding what topics you should address pre schoolers require fairly simple concrete ideas ideas such as saving water planting flowers recycling or cleaning up trash outside works better than more abstract ideas like species extinction or climate change teach children aged 5 to 11 can take on more complex projects they may still thrive on simple earth day activities they can also go deeper into ideas and do more complex ideas for instance they can measure how much water a bath takes versus a shower or learn the finer points of gardening or calculate how much money they will earn by redeeming 25 soda cans pre teens and teenagers can get deeper into sciences activism and community service projects they can also be more self directed choosing interests and connecting them with the world as a whole for example your fashion savvy teen can look into purchasing summer clothing from companies that use sustainable materials and processes or upcycle thrift store finds to reduce waste or perhaps take old concert t shirts and create fun throw pillows rather than throw them out make and set goals as a family if a family decides they want to reduce car use then make sure everyone has a bicycle scooter or other alternative transportation source plan to take shorter showers and time everyone for a week or turn off lights and create a fine jar for any family member who does not engage in reuse or recycling craft projects choose a project that is easy to accomplish for the child s skill level the following are great craft options go through your recycling bins to look for containers such as tin cans that can be used as flower planters find soil and seeds to plant and grow your own herbs flowers or vegetables egg shells and milk bottles can also be used when their tops are removed encourage children to bring a little of the outdoors indoors have them gather rocks and paint them for paper weights you can also make ornaments out of pine cones or cover them in peanut butter or seeds for bird feeders make a paper mache globe by gathering newspaper and other paper from the recycling bins mix up a batch of paper mache glue with household materials use a blown up balloon for the center once the project is dry paint it with land and water using non toxic paint make a recyclers relay at a child s earth day party find aluminum plastic and other materials and give each child a bag full of mixed recycling give prizes to the fastest and most accurate recyclers it is ok to keep it simple even for teenagers picking up trash at the beach is a simple activity but it is appropriate for nearly all ages so is gardening or shopping at a secondhand store or going for a bicycle ride in fact there is a powerful message when families and communities do simple acts together to help the environment,Holidays-and-Traditions

right more than anything focus on the relationships of the parts of your sentence to the whole and how a reader can or can t separate the essential information from the non essential if you can get away without much punctuation and still retain the full sense that s just fine review your use of punctuation maybe you re using it with absolute perfection or maybe you re not using it at all but

how to find out someone s birthday,whether you forgot someone s birthday or just want to surprise a new friend by wishing them well on their special day there are a few simple ways you can find out someone s birthday without having to ask them directly be wary of internet sites that claim they can figure out someone s birthday for you these often require you to pay a fee and are not always reliable it s much easier to do some digging on social media ask other people who may know or chat with the person about a topic that might get them to reveal their date of birth on their own,pull up the person s facebook profile to view their info one easy way to discover someone s birthday is to look them up on facebook if you have an account of your own log in and type their name into the search bar at the top of the screen once you get to their profile you should see their date of birth displayed in the info box below their profile picture 1 x research source if the person has a private account you ll need to become friends with them to view their info tap or click the add friend button next to their name to send them a friend request if their date of birth isn t listed in their infobox try scanning their timeline to see if their other friends wished them a happy birthday the previous year just scroll down the page until you come to a group of birthday posts made on the same day follow the person on instagram and search for birthday related posts if you re on instagram you may be able to learn when someone s birthday is looking through their photos visit their profile page or that of one of their good friends and review their posts from the past year it s not uncommon for people to post pictures of themselves on their birthdays so chances are good that something will turn up 2 x research source if you re still not having any luck try scouring a mutual friends posts to look for pictures of them with the person you re looking for keep in mind that if the person s page is private you ll have to send them a follow request and wait for them to approve it before you can access their posts 3 x research source look for a birthday cake emoji to appear beside their name on snapchat snapchat displays a birthday cake emoji by users names on the birthday they specify in their info if you re friends with the person on snapchat type their name into your friend s list and see if a cake shows up next to it you may need to do this daily for a little while if you only have a vague idea of when their birthday is 4 x research source to get a better idea of when someone s birthday is from their snapchat profile check to see if they have their zodiac sign listed on their info panel their sign will appear as a small purple box emoji with 1 of 12 symbols inside 5 x research source if you don t know anything about astrology you can look up which dates of birth the person s sign corresponds to by visiting http snapchatemojis com birthdays check their twitter profile page or look for balloons on their tweets like other social media platforms twitter allows users to add their birthday to their info section if the person has entered their birthday it will appear in the upper left hand side of their page when their actual birthday arrives there will be a neon balloon overlay applied to any posts they make on that day 6 x research source including your date of birth on your profile page is optional so if the person opted not to enter theirs you ll have no choice but to find it out some other way consult your mutual friends talk to any friends or acquaintances you have in common and ask them if they happen to know when the person s birthday is even if they can t tell you off the top of their head they may offer to try and find out for you which will keep you from having to ask the person yourself 7 x research source try saying something like i think richard s birthday is coming up soon would you happen to know what day it s on if you re planning on surprising the person be sure to mention it to your connection otherwise they might let the cat out of the bag accidentally ask your boss or another coworker if you work with the person a coworker will likely have the information you re looking for especially if they ve worked with the person for multiple years if not speak with your boss in private and request their help in finding out they may be able to consult the company s employee records on your behalf you might also be able to discover a coworker s birthday in the process of seeking permission to throw an office party for them try asking something like would it be alright if we planned a small party for naomi s birthday do you know exactly what day it is get help from the person s family if you know them well enough if the person is a close friend appeal to one of their relatives it s as simple as saying i m drawing a complete blank when is john s birthday again chances are they ll be more than happy to jog your memory 8 x research source you should only reach out to someone s family members if you ve known them personally and have had contact with them in the past otherwise your harmless request may be perceived as an invasion of privacy take the direct approach by asking the person upfront if you recently met the person there s no harm in simply asking them when their birthday is saying when is your birthday what do you usually like to do for it can be an easy way to get the information you re looking for and start a friendly personal conversation they ll probably be pleased that you care enough to ask 9 x research source if the person is an old or close friend they probably won t care if you admit that their birthday slipped your memory just casually ask you ve got a birthday coming up pretty soon don t you when is it again gather clues by having the person share memories about their birthday for a more subtle option ask the person about the best birthday they ve ever had or ask them to describe their ideal birthday to you as they answer see if you can pick up on key pieces of info like what season it was or other events that took place around that time 10 x research source if you re still having trouble getting an exact date of them alter your line of questioning to press them for more revealing details if they mention going ice skating for example you might say that sounds fun so your birthday is in the winter bring up your birthday to encourage them to talk about theirs make an offhand remark about your birthday and see if the person reveals anything about their own in response a statement like i love having a february birthday it gives me something to look forward to when it s cold and dreary outside can serve as bait to get them to open up about their birthday or at least the month or general time of year 11 x research source if your birthday is coming up you can also say something like only one month until my birthday and see if they mention how long they have until theirs ask the person about their zodiac sign if you re familiar with astrology knowing someone s astrological sign can get you much closer to pinpointing their exact date of birth broach the subject by getting the person to tell you their zodiac sign and use that info to deduce a range of possible birthdays this will at least put you in the ballpark and help you focus your search 12 x research source when the person names their sign try to get them to divulge their actual birthday with a casual follow up question like oh you re a pisces that means you were born in september right with a little prompting they ll probably tell you the exact date if the person doesn t know their sign work your way towards the information you want in reverse ask them when they were born then go into the astrological significance of the date and time they ll never suspect that you were trying to learn when their birthday is,Holidays-and-Traditions

days where everything can be all about you but because a birthday is anticipated to be so magical it can often be a day full of disappointments that leads to post celebration blues,throw a brief pity party and then move on having a bad birthday is a huge letdown acknowledging that it was a bummer and mourning a little bit is important if you pretend you re not upset it can lead to a prolonged bad mood 1 x research source eat some ice cream or have a good cry but then move on you have some fun to plan throw yourself a post birthday party if your birthday didn t go the way you wanted it to take

it up further buy or make a cake to make it feel like a real birthday celebration treat yourself to some additional birthday extras there s no rule that says you can only accept gifts on your birthday so go out and treat yourself to some gifts during your birthday redo make sure to do things on that day or week that you will enjoy this won t fix your bad birthday completely but treating yourself can help ease the sting in the meantime buy yourself a present you were hoping to get but did not rent a favorite movie and order takeout from your favorite restaurant invite some friends over or have a solo diy spa day reflect on your disappointment take a moment to evaluate why you feel like you had a bad birthday did you want more attention from someone in particular was there an activity you were hoping to do but did not do birthdays always make you bummed understanding why you feel disappointed in particular will help you to address your bad mood assess whether or not you were anticipating disappointment for some people birthdays are a time when we worry so much about the big day before it happens that we experience the disappointment as though it has already occurred 2 x research source leading up to your birthday consider whether you were focusing on what you were worried would not happen if you were so worried about what gifts you would or wouldn t get or whether or not someone special would call on your birthday you have worked yourself up so much before your birthday even started this type of thinking causes so much anxiety about birthday expectations that having any fun is an uphill battle looking forward to what could happen rather than worrying about what won t happen this type of thinking is much more hopeful about all of the upcoming possibilities instead of looking towards the future with anxiety about what might not happen you were looking forward to your birthday with feelings of excitement and anticipation consider what your expectations were birthday expectations the anticipations for the day that often lead to a disappointing bad birthday typically fall into one of the following categories 3 x research source expectations of the birthday celebrations themselves because many of us expect birthdays to be a big deal a full day when you are showered with gifts and attention when this level of hype is not met the overall feeling for the day is that it was a big letdown we focus so much on what the birthday should be that we don t enjoy what it is expectations of where and what our life should be birthdays come once a year and are a prime time to reflect on the past year and consider the future for some this means coming to terms with the inaccuracy of the timeline of goals we devise for ourselves these expectations are often harder to deal with and can definitely sour a birthday understand that disappointment comes from within yes a birthday is a special day and yes you deserve to feel warmth and love on your birthday but nowhere is there a rule that says the entire world must revolve around you on that day disappointment is a feeling that is conjured internally and thus realizing that you are creating your own misery is key to changing how you think about the day 4 x research source pinpoint the exact cause behind your conjured disappointment because disappointment is a feeling that is created internally isolating the exact emotion causing the disappointment can help you move past the bad mood 5 x research source do you feel rejected especially since everything is posted on social media even small rejections like not many people writing happy birthday on your wall can feel intensely hurtful try to remember that anyone reaching out in any manner is a wonderful gesture it s not a competition for the most postings or likes are you worried about outstanding goals if expectations of where your life should be are causing your bad mood reflect on when and why you came up with that goal in the first place comparing yourself to others is never a good idea and maybe the goals you made for yourself when you were younger no longer match what you really want for yourself now are you brooding over one particular person not wishing you well on your birthday perhaps an ex or a crush didn t reach out on your birthday which can sting instead of thinking about the one person who didn t call think about those who did reread the cards or wall posts you received and redirect your thinking move past your disappointment rehashing the negatives of the day will not change the situation or the people you feel neglected you on your birthday thinking about it will not change what happened but it will make you feel worse instead redirect your thoughts and focus on something positive 6 x research source for example think about all that you have accomplished in the past year and beyond you might not be where you thought you d be at this time but you shouldn t negate the goals you did accomplish take a minute to make a list of wins for the year make a plan for what you would like to accomplish this year moving forward just remember to make your goals reasonable so that you don t set yourself up for more disappointment next year make a plan to really celebrate someone else s birthday if a friend or family members birthday is coming up get over your disappointment by helping to ensure that they aren t disappointed like you were on their special day it will make you feel better and it will make them feel loved lower your expectations maybe as a child you had a week of birthday celebrations culminating in a huge party with a giant cake that s great but it can profoundly affect what you expect for your current birthdays instead of expecting a big celebration next year try not expecting anyone to do anything this sounds negative but this will actually mean that anything good that happens will be an unexpected surprise understand that you only have control over yourself you cannot make your friends and family celebrate your birthday but you do have control over what the disappointment does to you don t let it consume you but don t ignore it either acknowledge that you are disappointed and then move on with your internal dialogue 7 x research source let your friends and family know it is likely that your friends and family don t realize that you feel you had a bad birthday perhaps this is because they feel like they celebrated your birthday appropriately and your expectations were just higher or perhaps birthdays are not as big of a deal to them either way consider one of these conversation starters so i m thinking i might schedule a massage since my birthday was last week this should let them know that you were hoping for some more treats on your birthday can you please help me organize a belated outing for my birthday there s nothing wrong with asking for help in fact this will not only let them know that your expectations weren t met but will also ensure that the activities are exactly what you want to do i know we went out to dinner for my birthday but i kind of feel like going dancing too what do you think this is a subtle but non passive aggressive way of indicating that you enjoyed the birthday activities thus far but were also hoping for a little more fun before the day is over learn from it whether you consistently feel bummed about your birthday or this was the first year you had a bad birthday learn from your experience and let that knowledge influence your entire year also try putting it into perspective is this birthday disappointment something that you will remember in 6 months 3 months 8 x research source be thankful for all that you have happy birthday,Holidays-and-Traditions

and family involved if you re hosting a house party or a shindig where you will be doing some of the legwork enlist family and friends to come early to help with the preparations and get to enjoy your birthday glow before the larger party gets started ask friends to bring something rather than accepting gifts requesting contributions to the birthday party effort suggesting that guests bring drinks snacks particular dishes plates or even music or games is one way to involve the everyone in the putting on of the celebration and lessen the economic burden on yourself also when guests feel more involved and feel that they have contributed to a party or gathering they will feel more invested in the sense of camaraderie and community that a good party creates if you re going for a full meal at your party potlucks are a great way to make your friends a part of the cooking ask everyone to bring a dish or create a signup sheet with an online invite service for coordination of dishes know

element of say a birthday party can make such experiences beneficial to our health rather than a drag on it be flexible as with any event planning don t expect every bit of minutiae to happen exactly

it s your birthday and well you can cry if you want to but there s really no need everyone will have a good time if the host or guest of honor is relaxed and enjoying themselves so that s all you need to worry about things happening differently than planned makes for a great story so when the section of birthday cake with your name on it falls off the serving knife don t sweat it let yourself be pampered if you have family or friends around that express a desire to help make your birthday memorable let them going out to breakfast brunch or lunch is a good way to spend time with close friends and family members before you get on to the later events of your birthday pamper yourself also get some quality spa or massage time or have a luxurious bath followed by chocolates put aside your responsibilities for a day if possible allow yourself check out on your birthday don t let that big deal at the office go awry of course and you should still make sure your kids have a ride home from school but your birthday can be an annual guilt free opportunity to not worry about the dishes or that wall that needs painting or other minor tasks that you have on your plate if possible get your

long you do this for depends on the type of candy melts you are using some melt quicker than others 14 x research source cut the tip off with a pair of scissors only cut off a tiny bit or the melted candy will come out too thick in the next step 15 x research source trace over your template then fill it in use the piping bag to outline your number with the melted chocolate next fill the number in using a tight zigzag motion make sure that there are no gaps visible 16 x research source consider adding some sprinkles here is where you can get really creative you can cover the entire number with sprinkles or just add a dash for a textured number match the color of the sprinkles to your chocolate for a colorful number use rainbow colored sprinkles 17 x research source tuck the number into the

how to pick a birthday gift for a new girlfriend,what should you get a new girlfriend for her birthday the trick is to make sure you don t come on too strong too soon while still letting her know you remembered now s the time to make a good impression,choose a sentimental gift it will probably touch her heart if you buy your girlfriend something sentimental for example you could buy her something that represents how you met that s probably not going to be too over the top but it will convey that you are someone who s thoughtful and pays attention to details and that you re happy you met her maybe you met in a coffee shop get her a mug from there 1 x research source maybe you met her in a bookstore get her a book from the section she was in when you first saw her the point of such a gift is to show you care without being too romantic because it s early on the benefit of such an approach is that it s just a coffee cup yet it also has a deeper meaning give her flowers that aren t roses roses are probably too romantic for a new relationship and they re kind of a cliche anyway you could look up the meanings behind other flowers send her a bouquet with a card that says did you know calla lilies are said to symbolize magnificence and beauty happy birthday and i just wanted you to know i m glad we met and i hope you have a nice day today 2 x research source other flower meanings would work too daffodils would be a great choice because the yellow flowers symbolize new beginnings it will up the romance if you have the flowers delivered purple irises symbolize eloquence gladiolus symbolizes strength of character the goal here is to match the flower to something about her that you admire and let her know the meaning stay away from cliches you want to make an impression when a relationship is new it would be a mistake to ignore her birthday because most people appreciate being remembered however you want to put some thought into it without seeming like you are getting too serious too fast so avoid cliches that means you should forget the box of chocolates it also means that you can bypass the cheap bouquet of wilted roses at the local grocery store 3 x research source instead strive for something that shows you ve noticed her uniqueness and you re a thoughtful person that will make the best impression make her a cake she might appreciate your effort even if you re not a very good baker alternatively you could buy her a cake with a creative saying on it that will have some meaning to her you could also keep it lighter by making or buying a cupcake for her many communities have specialty cupcake stores buy her a creative flavor most people appreciate having a cake on their birthday so she will probably appreciate the effort and if you actually made it and it s not perfect she might even laugh in a goodhearted way and find it endearing buy her something moderately priced the goal here isn t to spend too much money but to show you ve put some thought into it you could buy her a pair of fluffy slippers or a new iphone case in a color that you know she likes if she drinks you could buy her a nice bottle of wine and read up on the winery so you explain why you picked that brand avoid buying her clothing if you ve just met it can be very perilous to try to guess women s sizes buy her nice stationery or a print you got at a local art fair a good rule of thumb is to spend between 15 and 50 for a first gift spending more than 100 might make it seem like you are trying too hard to impress 4 x research source make her a gift basket this should be one you put together yourself inside it place inexpensive items that are things you know she likes if she likes snickers for example put some in there ditto with cherry coke or funny socks add in a book you know she would like and a couple of movie tickets if she likes those you could include a small stuffed animal depending on her age that works better if she s under 25 put mostly food items in the gift basket or other things that relate to things she likes to do if she loves golfing you could include a new set of golf balls for example buy something practical if it s a new relationship it s a good idea to err on the side of practicality versus romance don t buy her something that she ll laugh about to her friends though such as a toaster or a vacuum cleaner rather buy her something that you ve noticed she needs she will probably appreciate your thoughtfulness you could also buy her something more artistic for her house such as a pretty vase you found 5 x research source for example you could buy her an espresso machine and tell her you ve noticed she likes espresso if she does but that she only has a regular coffee machine buy her tickets to a future event however don t make it too far into the future that might be presumptuous if the relationship is new what does work is to buy her tickets for an event that upcoming weekend but maybe inquire gently as to whether she is available you could also buy her tickets to a new movie she s been talking about wanting to see these could be tickets to a local wine festival to a concert for a band she enjoys to a book reading or to any number of things 6 x research source another possibility is to give her a card indicating the event you d like to take her to try to choose one that doesn t require tickets like a local fest that way you re not making assumptions about her time these gifts are called experience gifts and they produce memories if you do them together 7 x research source take her to an amusement park offer to do something for her maybe you noticed that her hedges need trimming or that her refrigerator is making loud noises tell her for her birthday you would like to come over and help her out with x y or z she will probably appreciate the fact she can rely on you give her a nice card that explains that although the relationship is new you are enjoying getting to know her and wanted to do something that shows her she can rely on you as the relationship progresses smile and say don t worry when things aren t so new i can be a romantic person too but i m trying to be respectful and take it at a nice pace buy her a book this gift has a dual purpose it shows her that you are a person with intellect and also that you have a sense of her likes pick something that relates to a topic she is interested in you probably can t go wrong with a book of poetry try e e cummings or if she is irish william butler yeats let s say she is a lawyer you could get her a biography of a lawyer she admires in other words try to tie the book into her life somehow whatever you do don t buy her a cheap pop culture paperback unless it s a book she mentioned or the book a movie she loves was based on and don t buy her a self help book along the same lines you could buy her a cd from a band she likes write her a poem even if you re not the best writer of all time the fact that you tried will probably please her the poem should be light and fun not heady and about love at this point one benefit of writing a poem in a new relationship is that poetry is subjective meaning there are many ways to interpret it and at the beginning of a relationship you will generally want to be a little mysterious still you could focus the poem on an attribute of hers that you like don t only think physical but if you do pick something like the color of her eyes or her smile keep it short instead focus on a trait of hers you admire maybe it s how she talks to everyone the same no matter their socioeconomic status maybe it s that she loves animals maybe it s that she is fearless or hard working give her a nice card you could find a card that is geared toward a new relationship hunt around in the card aisle find one that doesn t convey platonic friendship and isn t gushing with love either you can find poems with statements that fit an early relationship inside the card write something short but heartfelt you could write something like i ve really enjoyed getting to know you and i m glad we met happy birthday i look forward to seeing how this evolves a nice touch would be to include a pressed flower inside the card representing a trait you see in her alternatively you could write her a handwritten letter that expresses that you are happy you met her and explains what attracted you to her give her vintage jewelry everyone knows that jewelry connotes seriousness in a relationship especially if it s a ring so stay away from rings it s too soon however that doesn t mean you can t give her jewelry just because the relationship is new you can but it should be something more decorative than romantic you could get ideas of what she likes from her pinterest page if she has one 8 x research source for example you could pick up a pair of vintage earrings and tell her you knew they d look good on her when you saw them because they reminded you of the color she was wearing when you met you could buy her a pretty bracelet turquoise earrings or basically any type of jewelry that is not a ring avoid gemstones like diamonds for now go quirky and artistic not expensive invite her to dinner tell her you know she might be busy on her birthday but if she s not you d love to take her to dinner you could also make her dinner since it s a new relationship don t assume she is spending her birthday with you though ask her a few days before if you can take her to dinner for it ask her what her favorite restaurant is unless you already know it pick something she will like or simply ask her where she would like to go make sure to pay come armed with a card dinner is an inherently romantic setting if you pick a place where you have to dress up the other benefit of inviting her to dinner is that you will have a chance to talk to her and get to know her better make sure you tell the server it s her birthday buy her a candle candles are great because they have a romantic connotation but they also can be simply decorative buy her a candle with a romantic scent like cinnamon ocean mist or vanilla vanilla is an aphrodisiac 9 x research source try not to pick something too homespun like an apple or pumpkin pie the goal here is to send her a subtle signal that you want to pursue more than friendship put the candle in a pretty bag and include a nice card that thanks her for the time you ve spent together treat her to a spa tell her you know she has a lot on her plate at work if she does and that you wanted to make sure she takes time for herself give her a gift certificate for a massage at a reputable local salon or for a manicure or pedicure you could also treat her to a facial but a massage might be a safer route because she won t think you re implying she needs it you could just give her a general gift certificate to the spa and include a list of the services inside letting her pick,Holidays-and-Traditions
how to know what to get your boyfriend for his birthday,men have a sometimes well deserved reputation of being difficult to shop for the pressure is doubled when you re trying to figure out what to get your boyfriend for his birthday no matter how impossible it may seem every girlfriend is more than capable of getting her boyfriend a birthday present he ll love,think about your boyfriend s hobbies and interests put yourself in his shoes think about what he might buy for himself if he had the money and wanted to treat himself people who do this tend to give gifts that the recipient loves more often than people who don t try seeing things from another point of view think about what he does in his spare time or the sorts of things he reads or watches anything that helps him pursue these is sure to make him smile listen for hints he knows his birthday is coming up and that you re obligated to get him something just as well as you do he ll probably try to help you out by dropping some hints into your normal conversations expect to start hearing hints about three or four weeks before his birthday comes if he brings something up multiple times it s something you should definitely investigate further some hints can be subtle instead out saying that he d really like it if someone got him the boxed set of his favorite tv series he might say something like i saw this box set came out a few weeks ago it looked really cool ask his friends and family he may be more comfortable talking about what he wants for his birthday with his friends and family than he is with you talk to them when your boyfriend isn t around to see if they have any ideas that might help if you decide to go with something that they mention make sure to ask them to keep it a secret consult your own group of friends your boyfriend is probably around your friends a lot of the time if you re feeling stressed about how to get your boyfriend a birthday present he ll love ask your friends for some advice they will be able to offer some helpful insight into what types of gifts their boyfriends have appreciated and what might be something nice to get for yours you shouldn t do this if your friends don t know your boyfriend at all you can still ask them for advice but take it with a grain of salt ask your boyfriend for ideas not everyone can be psychic when it comes to knowing what people want for their birthday if you re really feeling frazzled and can t think of anything good just ask your boyfriend for some suggestions he won t mind that you needed a little help from him in fact gifts that people ask for often end up being the most appreciated ones 1 x research source for example you can ask him for a birthday wish list then buy 1 or 2 items off of that list alternatively you can ask him what sort of things he d like to get such as winter accessories then use what you know about him to fill in the details like color and pattern set a budget figure out how much you can reasonably afford to spend on a gift for your boyfriend be strict about it and don t get anything that goes over it contrary to what you may think the monetary value of a gift doesn t have a huge impact on how much the recipient enjoys it in fact recipients enjoy cheap gifts just as much as they do expensive ones as long as they re both thoughtful 2 x research source consider how long you ve been dating if you ve been dating for six months or less don t get him something expensive even if you can easily afford it you don t know how long the relationship will last if you end up together for a long time you ll have plenty more birthdays you can spoil him on 3 x research source you may be able to get more bang for your buck if you buy something refurbished or hunt for sales this is an especially good idea if you re thinking about getting him electronics most of the time they come with a warranty and your boyfriend probably won t care or notice that someone used it for a little bit before he did do some research on his hobbies and interests if you don t know a whole lot about what your boyfriend spends his time doing then it s time to do a little research you can learn pretty much anything on the internet in an hour spend some time searching his hobbies and interests and reading anything that talks about them read any websites dedicated to bringing hobbyists and enthusiasts together and see what s new in the field you may need to take his level of experience and expertise when you re thinking of gifts if your boyfriend has been skateboarding since he could walk it doesn t make sense to get a beginner s board that he ll probably hate riding at the same time an expensive fly fishing rod doesn t make sense if he s only gone fishing two or three times in his life ask people with similar interests for help if you re stuck there are online communities for pretty much any pastime imaginable look for forums and other groups dedicated to discussing something your boyfriend likes to do make an account and explain your predicament chances are the members will offer helpful advice that will guide you towards getting your boyfriend something he ll love you may find lists that say something like 10 great gifts for guys who love hiking these can be helpful but sometimes they are just a marketing tool to sell stuff if you get an idea from a list like this try to find some actual reviews to see if it s worth it or not think of some gifts that are either sentimental or practical as long as your gift fits into one of these categories he ll appreciate it it shouldn t just be another addition to his collection of stuff it should be something he will actually use or something that he can look at and remember all the happy moments you ve shared together 4 x research source don t limit yourself to products sometimes experiences can make a much better gift make a video of all his friends and family sharing their favorite memory of your boyfriend schedule an activity that you know he ll enjoy that you can do together he may not be able to show it off like he d be able to with other presents but it will mean a lot more to him 5 x research source stay away from classically bad gifts it can be tempting to get your boyfriend something like a tie or shaving kit for their birthday it makes sense these are pretty common and obvious answers to the question of what makes a good gift for a boyfriend in reality these gifts pretty much always fall flat if it seems like a stereotypical gift from a girlfriend consider other options unless you re positive he ll love it 6 x research source narrow it down to one idea lots of people make the mistake of getting one big gift and a bunch of small ones for their loved ones it s easy to see why after all isn t more always better in fact giving small presents alongside your large one will make the main gift seem less special it is better to put a lot of effort into one gift rather than no effort into multiple gifts have it ready well in advance few things are as stressful as not knowing whether your present will be ready in time for your boyfriend s birthday give yourself a couple of weeks to buffer yourself and make sure everything is right check how long any online orders will take to ship give yourself extra time when buying gifts online sometimes items come late or damaged sometimes they don t come at all keep it a surprise if you know any of your friends or your boyfriend s friends are likely to spill the beans don t tell them what you got your boyfriend for his birthday drop your boyfriend a few hints if you want to but not anything that s specific enough that he ll be able to guess what you got him he ll appreciate what he gets a lot more if he isn t expecting it pay attention to presentation a beautiful presentation will make your boyfriend excited to open the gift he s been anticipating not only that but it will show your effort and that you really do care for example 7 x research source if you got him something you can wrap make sure the paper and ribbon complement one another and that the gift is neatly wrapped if you got him something that s better off written in a card pick a card he ll like and put some effort into making your handwriting look good pair it with a thoughtful note talk about why you care for him and why you thought he would like the gift even if it isn t perfect the old saying it s the thought that counts has been proven to be true people hold gifts that people spent a lot of time and energy thinking about in just as high a regard as they do gifts they ve been asking about for months as long as you really put some effort in and got reasonably close to the mark he ll love it 8 x research source keep it light if you ve only been dating a few months it s pretty awkward to go on and on about how he s your entire world if you haven t known each other very long talk about how much fun you have spending time together but don t drop anything too heavy on him,Holidays-and-Traditions

them to help you work the room making sure no one is standing alone 13 x research source ask a couple of guests to stay to help you clean up after the party it s your birthday so you shouldn t be

onto your balloon arch using fishing line and continue to fill the arch with clusters of balloons until it is completely covered 1 x research source this creates a festive archway or accent piece use balloons in your color scheme so everything matches for instance if throwing a party for a young boy use red blue and green secure numerous balloons to a piece of string to make an attractive garland cut a piece of string or yarn to the size you d like your garland to be thread 1 end of the string through a yarn needle and pierce the needle through the plastic tail of the balloon scoot the balloon down the string and add several more balloons to fill the garland use tape to secure both ends of the garland to a wall table or doorway 2 x research source once you hang the garland you can reposition the balloons as you d like for instance make a 5 ft 1 5 m balloon garland and hang it around your cake and gift table group several balloons into bunches to make a colorful accent to make round balloon decorations blow up several balloons using a hand pump and tie them at the end then pierce a zip tie through the tail of 1 balloon continue piercing the tails of the remaining balloons until they are all attached to the zip tie connect the zip tie ends and pull it as tight as you can hang the cluster of balloons to the walls or from the ceiling using clear string 3 x research source use 1 color of balloons for each cluster and make 3 5 different balloon clusters for a colorful festive decoration use more or less balloons based on your personal preference create giant balloon flowers if hosting a spring themed birthday party use 1 yellow balloon for the center and 5 colored balloons to make the petals blow up all of your balloons and knot them at the end then attach 5 petal balloons by tying 2 pairs together at a time then push the yellow balloon into the center and twist the tail of the balloon around the other tails to form the flower 4 x research source make multiple flowers in several colors if you want a bright cheery decoration once you create your flower tie it to a stick to make your stem tape the flower to the wall to create an all over display tape balloons of various sizes to the wall for a creative choice blow up some large balloons medium balloons and small balloons to make your display then use 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm sized pieces of double sided tape to attach the balloons to the wall arrange the different sized balloons randomly across the wall for an all over decoration 5 x research source this is a great idea if you want to cover a large space use balloons of various shades of the same colors to create a monochrome look for example pick light blue balloons for your smallest size royal blue for the medium size and dark blue for the

overtop the tail end place a few dots of craft glue along the top edge of the cone to secure it onto the balloon 8 x research source do this for each of your individual balloons to make a fun summery decoration this is a great idea if you are hosting a party at a swim club for example use pieces of paper to turn your balloons into pieces of fruit first pick out which fruit you d like to make you

double sided tape to create the general shape then tape the leaves and stem details to the balloon where you attach the string 9 x research source for example to make a bunch of grapes inflate 4 8 purple balloons draw a leaf on a green piece of construction paper and tape it to the top of the bunch do this if you want to create a tropical themed party tie a balloon onto goodie bags to add a festive touch blow up 1 balloon with a hand pump or a helium tank and tie the tail of the balloon so it stays in place then attach a 3 4 ft 0 91 1 22 m string or ribbon to the tail of the balloon tie

how to throw a birthday party,if you ve ever been to a bad birthday party you know how disappointing it can be but a good party can be a memory for a lifetime even if the birthday boy or girl is just a few years old,schedule the party around naptime the best time for a baby s or toddler s birthday is on a weekend afternoon the parents are generally available for a couple of hours and the invited kids birthday honoree included can nap before or after choose a day that s a 2 3 weeks out to give the parents advanced notice have a start and end time say 1 3 pm this way no one shows up too late and they don t feel pressure to stage an awkward exit at some point in the day there will be an actual group exodus 2 hours later this makes it easy on the child and easy on the parents it s no pressure and convenient so they ll be more likely to come this is also a good amount of time to fit into everyone s schedules choose your guests wisely this is one of the only times in your child s life where the guests are going to very different people of mixed ages they ll be friends neighbors family members and children close to your child s age though not necessarily the same think about how many people you can handle being the host generally speaking a good number is around 10 the more ages and types you bring the more you ll have to be accommodating if other young children are present they ll need entertaining you ll need adult food and child food too think about what each person would need when you re compiling your list pick your invite platform you ll need to send out invites for the guests either via snail mail email or phone call having something tangible is best a text or a phone call is easily forgettable there are a few websites like evite that can set up personalized invitations for you too 1 x research source the main benefit of snail mail is that you can make it truly your own if you go this route consider adding a personal touch with your baby s handprint on the invite that s one for the scrapbook however you ll likely want to send out a phone call or a text 3 5 days before the party to make sure everyone has remembered the event and to gather rsvps give guests a clue on what you d like for gifts many parents don t want more toys for their children if you want something specific for gifts be direct on the invitation indicate whether you want practical items money or gift cards or nothing at all it s not impolite it s saving them the hassle of buying something you don t actually want however stay away from demanding gifts that are too expensive or demanding them in the first place if they re watching their wallets they ll be less likely to come if gifts are mandatory plan the food item number one on the checklist cake that s a given but apart from that what else will you need well it depends on your guests cater to their ages have some adult food and some kid friendly food you don t need to plan a meal just have snacks available throughout the party you can make a boxed cake seem like bakery made heaven with the addition of mayonnaise or an extra egg no need to spend a ton of money on a professional cake for a birthday your child will not likely remember and this way you can get all the credit for the delicious dessert if you d like make goody bags for the guests everyone loves a nice goody bag especially if they went out of their way to get you a gift and make room in their schedule for your party show them you appreciate them coming with a goody bag even if it s just for the kids if it s not for the adults they ll still be glad they came as their kids have something to keep them occupied it s more to show them your appreciation and to make it a day for everyone prep your toddler if your child is old enough to understand let them know what s going to happen a bunch of people are coming over to celebrate them presents but it also means that other kids might see their stuff that their routine will be interrupted etc if they understand what s happening they may stay calmer let them know that this is a day of fun it shouldn t be stressful or scary most of the time will be spent playing games opening presents and eating food if the kids are old enough plan a few games having a bunch of 3 year olds running around for 2 hours will not be the best birthday party for the books especially according to the other parents to be sure they stay at least semi occupied plan a few games for them this also lets the parents enjoy themselves need some ideas start out with a craft keeping the kids entertained with coloring paper glitter and whatever else you have around the house then move onto musical hot potato freeze dancing or a non competitive round of musical chairs 2 x research source plan a theme going to a restaurant or to a bowling alley is great but your kid might go ga ga over a themed birthday party and you could even have that theme at the bowling alley anyway it makes it easier to pick out decorations design the cake and choose activities talk to your child about what they d like it should come down to their preferences if your child has pretty outlandish taste i want a hashtag theme mom take him or her to the party supply store with you show them the options and let them pick from there pick a guest list with your child now that your child is growing up the guest list should be a collaborative effort cap it at around 7 or so other children depending on how many other parents will be available you don t want to be left supervising 20 children on your own sit down with your birthday er and pick out who they really really want at their party make sure invitations get handed out covertly if only certain friends are getting invited it should be handled with care so the other kids don t get upset you can either deliver them yourself ask a teacher to hand them out with other items or have your child do it covertly if you think they can handle it organize a few activities if kids are left to their own version of fun you re going to enter the room finding spaghetti on the walls chairs broken and someone crying in the corner organize a few activities to keep everyone happy and the chaos to a minimum games with music face painting or craft making are trusty standards a warm up activity is good too 3 x research source that way as the kids trickle in the early birds are content having something to do keep the food simple kids are easily impressed if you can whip up a bunch of mini corn dogs their tummies will be smiling have a few healthier snacks pretzels a veggie plate in addition to some candy and finger foods like chips and salsa the time of the party will determine the food if it s just in the afternoon you ll only need snacks during a meal try ordering pizza or getting take out what s the most important part the cake of course talk your teen about what they d like where and when now that your child is old enough they should have a big say in their party do they want it at home or out what do they want to do do they want it during the day or at night if they have a bunch of ideas narrow it down for them to 3 or so that you ve preapproved they can then pick which one they want from there talk about a budget and scheduling constraints you ll have to be the voice of reason in this conversation be honest and let them know what s doable and what s not plan out the guest list ask your teen to come up with the short list 8 or so people they want at their party ultimately the party should be determined by where it is if it s somewhere else that s less work for you and how long it s going to last 8 people out for pizza is manageable but you ll only want to take 3 or 4 to the amusement park you re finally at an age where it matters who gets invited some people may not get along or not want to do certain things talk to your teen about what the people they re inviting are like if they know each other and any problems they foresee consider doing it elsewhere like at a restaurant trampoline park bowling alley or arcade your teen likely wants freedom and it s easier on you too make sure the invites get sent out appropriately teens are at an age where feelings can get hurt if your teen is inviting some kids at school and not others find a way to make it so the invites are sent out discreetly if they re not it might start unnecessary drama that could dampen the event if possible send them via email ask for rsvps so you know who is coming and can have a head count have your teen send reminder texts or phone calls too before the big day consider having a theme theme parties are fun for 4 year olds 40 year olds and everyone in between though the themes change over time talk to your teen about having a theme the kids can then dress up you ll have fun planning out themed food and it ll make it easier to decorate and find matching additions this should be your teen s decision as long as it s appropriate and doable it should be a go if you don t like it give your teen a good reason why and offer alternatives provide all the fixin s for your party this is especially important if you re having the party at home plan and arrange all the food and decorate till the cows come home with a theme it ll be easier to pick out if you don t have one it s up to you here s a few things to keep in mind keep the snacks coming worry less about the main food you can always whip up spaghetti or order pizza depending on what the party goers feel like but don t forget the cake to keep the mess better for you buy plastic plates forks knives and cups to keep the after party clean up to a minimum don t be nervous to ask other parents to bring along a few dishes if the party is at your house a few bags of chips or some liters of soda is an easy way they can chip in keep a watchful eye but allow them their fun you need to be there to problem solve and diffuse any tension but when things are going well allow them their space and their fun they re at an age where they can take care of themselves be as far away as you feel is appropriate odds are your teen will need you to order the pizza or take care of any mess they create while it may not be in the way you want you ll likely be needed to stay relatively near plan the who what when and where an adult birthday party can be anything from a few people gathering for drinks to a room full of people rocking out to live music it all comes down to the preferences of the birthday honoree simple and classy or totally outrageous having it at home is easiest but that means cleaning cooking entertaining and cleaning some more however having it at home is cheaper and you have free reign of your territory if you do have it at home consider having everyone bring a dish or a drink this keeps the burden off you and makes it a more interactive affair if you re going out make a reservation as soon as possible some places are hard to get into on a moment s notice send out the invites well beforehand unlike kids adults have a million and one things going on that they have to attend to to get all your guests to come send out invites well in advance about 2 3 weeks this way they can write down the party in their calendar before the slot fills up send something concrete like an email a phone call or text is easy to forget and often doesn t seem official but don t hesitate to send a reminder text a few days before the party choose a theme or over arching activity there are a couple of things that can make any party monumental pick a theme where your guests can dress up eat special foods and take part in themed activities this could be anything from an 80s theme with neon colors and bad movies to golf with parfaits and mini golf set up in the basement to a cartoon character theme where you get to relive your childhood plan an event it could be a photo scavenger hunt throughout the city a pub crawl or a macaroni and cheese tasting at your house where everyone brings a different variation this adds extra excitement about your party and keeps people from being bored too consider entertainment like live music or a sports game with this route all the planning is done for you cover all the food and drink necessities if you re having the party at your house make sure everyone s well taken care of you ll need hors d oeuvres for people to munch on all night long and food to accommodate everyone s allergies and diets some gluten free and vegetarian plates may be a good idea what s more you ll likely want alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks available for those that don t drink keep it fun by making a punch or some other concoction that makes them feel like they re a part of it too decorate the area according to your theme did you choose old hollywood as your theme get some old film reels some black and white decorations and roll out the red carpet on your sidewalk 90s bust out the scrunchies the high waisted jeans the bright colors and blast some spice girls the limit is only your imagination and your budget don t have a theme no problem for that macaroni and cheese party set up a large board for everyone to vote on or make them personalized voting cards make name tags and decorate the table to make the mac n cheese look better than it already does keep everyone mingling since you re likely the glue that holds this party together try your best to work in and out of circles introducing them to one another and starting games if the atmosphere calls for it keep them safe too if drinking is involved take their keys and put them in a safe place when they go to leave make sure they re sober before they drive away if not arrange a designated driver to take them home,Holidays-and-Traditions

from everything else and instead spending it with them,know how to apologize when you hurt someone like forgetting a person s birthday express that you recognize what you ve done and are concerned about their feelings when deciding how you will apologize think about the person to whom you re apologizing who are they to you what is the person like what would that person find most meaningful let the answers to these questions guide you in creating your apology 1 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source design and mail a personalized jigsaw puzzle one way to apologize and demonstrate you truly mean it is to spread your apology out over the course of several days or more here s one way to do this there are websites online that allow you to upload photos which they then use to create a jigsaw puzzle for you of varying sizes choose a photo of the two of you based upon your relationship and the message you want to convey in your apology upload the photo and when you get the puzzle write on the back of each piece expressing that you re sorry and if you choose what the person means to you it doesn t have to be sappy or sentimental something funny might be best for the person whose birthday you forgot when you re done mail one piece or more of the puzzle every day to the other person 2 x research source create i m sorry coupons another way to spread out your apology is to create apology or i m sorry coupons or vouchers for services or activities that the other person can redeem at times of his or her choosing again think about who the person is and what would be most meaningful when deciding what you ll be giving you can either make the coupons yourself using art supplies or your computer and printer or you can go to websites like givecoupons com or spottedsparrow com and have them printed for you on the back write what each coupon is worth 3 x research source apologize

to your relationship and the person s personality add a photo quote or song that is particularly poignant or funny to you both it s highly unlikely he or she will be the only person to respond 4 x research source go on air to apologize another way to publicly apologize is to say you re sorry on air if you know what radio station the person listens to every day on the way to work or at another time contact the program s dj and explain the situation ask if you can get 30 seconds of scheduled on air time to make your apology also see if they ll play a particular song right after it a song that is special to you and the other person be persistent if you don t get a response right away if they agree write out what you plan to say and rehearse it you ll only have one chance and you want to nail it to ensure the other person turns on the radio that day and at that time you may need to enlist the help of someone you can trust to keep it a secret if that s not an option call the other person shortly before you go on air and say he or she should turn on the radio because they re playing some really good music or something to that effect wait for national i forgot day july 2nd is national i forgot day believe it or not there does indeed exist such a day if the other person s birthday wasn t too much before july 2nd you could use this day to your advantage go to nationalcalendar com and order a national day wall calendar when you get it circle july 2nd and write a personalized apology for missing his or her birthday ask the person over for dinner at your place on july 2 if he or she can t do dinner try lunch make a home cooked meal with all of their favorites and set the table with only the calendar as the other person s place mat so it will be sure to stand out when you sit down to eat point to the calendar and make your apology one that likely won t be forgotten bestow a night of babysitting obviously this would be for someone who has a child or children but as apologies go this is golden for the stretched too thin parents of today get creative about how you might present it and your apology if the other person has an infant for example show up one day unannounced with a baby doll in a stroller tucked into the doll s hand or side have a card expressing your apologies for missing their birthday along with a certificate you made for a day or evening of free babysitting 5 x research source you ll probably need to stipulate that you ll need some advance notice but do it in the fine print clean up their computer we all know someone who isn t particularly tech savvy and has so many files on his or her desktop that it s amazing anything can be found let alone opened generally it s become quite the nightmare for the person too one way to apologize to someone like this and make quite an impact would be to give his or her computer a little sprucing up assuming you know how to do such things email the person a personalized belated birthday card letting him or her know you feel badly about forgetting and that you d like to redeem yourself by breathing new life into the contraption they re staring at now 6 x research source take on the yard work while there are a few people in the world who genuinely enjoy mowing the lawn trimming edges and pulling weeds it s safe to say the vast majority would rather spend sunday afternoons doing other things like watching football or going shopping in the air conditioning thus for many taking this off their hands in the way of an apology could mean an awful lot consider who the person is when thinking about how you ll deliver your apology and this gift of your time 7 x research source for example if it s your father perhaps you could sneak into his closet and get his work clothes and boots dress up in them and deliver your apology written on a watering can or a bag of leaves you ve already raked and sacked atone with a night of romance one of the birthdays you most don t want to forget and typically suffer the most consequences from is that of your romantic partner or husband or wife not a good thing nor easy to remedy however a surprise candlelit dinner for two with roses and a thoughtfully written card followed by a hot bubble bath a long massage and whatever comes after well that probably has some mileage in helping to make up for forgetting your loved one s birthday and it likely won t be a much of a burden for you to bear either 8 x research source create a happiness jar when you feel badly enough about forgetting a person s birthday that you want to make it up to them somehow it signals that you have a special relationship of some kind it indicates you truly care making that person a happiness jar can show this all it takes is a mason jar with a lid paper and a pen of course you can get more creative but what matters most is what you write on each piece of paper that you put in the jar write down a memory you have of the person something you experienced together something you remember the other person saying or doing one day the way he or she looked on a special occasion how you feel about the person now and at different times since you ve known one another include one larger piece of paper or a small card saying you re sorry for missing his or her birthday if there s room left throw in their favorite candies tokens to the arcade if you do that together small items the person might collect and so forth decorate the jar if you d like tie a ribbon around it paint on it hodge podge a photo of the two of you on one side 9 x research source bake a cake from far away sometimes the person doesn t live nearby and while you can call email send a card or a traditional present maybe you re also looking for something with a bit more punch behind your apology here s one idea videotape yourself as you make the person his or her favorite kind of birthday cake you could make it humorous or you could pretend as if you re the star of a cooking show which the other person might also find quite funny you could even light the candles sing him or her happy birthday and then express your apologies burn your video to a disc write out the cake recipe and wrap it like a birthday present before you send it in the mail if you think the cake will survive the journey send it too or perhaps just a slice download their favorite tunes if you ve never looked online before usb flash drives now come in all shapes sizes colors and materials there are even action hero usb flash drives you can also have them customized from a variety of online sites which is exactly what you want to do since they re small and you won t have much space to convey your message keep it simple or consider using a symbol or photo then fill it with the other person s favorite music music that you own of course 10 x research source add photos of you together create a special playlist before you give it to the other person go online and print a piece of blank sheet music write your apology and birthday wishes on it when you present the usb drive post post it notes if you have access to the person s home buy a package of multi colored post it notes and write a variety of messages on them tailored to the person and your relationship memories quotes feelings jokes tape small photos or other mementos such as a ticket from a concert you went to together to mention some of them while he or she is not home stick them in both obvious and more hidden places throughout the house so they re found not only when the person comes home and sees them everywhere but also over time then tape several together to create a card expressing your apology that you can either leave after you ve gone post it note crazy or that you can be waiting to hand deliver 11 x research source plan a day of awesomeness very few things show you care more than wanting to spend time with another person knowing them well enough to plan a day of awesomeness only amplifies that here s how it works think about all the things they love to do in your city or area favorite places to eat favorite activities favorite places to go and then plan a day touching on all those things it could even be a surprise day of awesomeness 12 x research source arrange it so you pick the person up in the morning when you arrive present the day s itinerary taped to the menu from the restaurant where the day begins with the person s favorite eggs benedict enjoy a picnic food and sunshine maybe a lake river or ocean perhaps even a grill who doesn t love a nice picnic you can go with just the other person or invite others along all it requires is picking a time a location and packing food drinks a blanket and whatever you might want to play with or ride while you re there you don t even need a car when you invite the person to the picnic pack a sack lunch in a brown paper bag and write your apology in sharpie on the bag place the bag on a frisbee tie a ribbon around both and pass it to your loved one with a smile pack up and hit the road this might require a little more planning and more money depending upon where you go but taking a trip getting away and spending time one on one may be just the apology needed in some cases or it could just be an immensely fun time with someone you care for and whom you want to make sure knows it it might be a one night stay in a quirky town two hours away a weekend in nyc or a week long trip to australia budgets and schedules vary but one thing is constant the importance of making time for and spending time with people who matter most what better way then to invite them on the trip than to give them a bell alarm clock with your apologies written on the back if you re splurging buy a watch and have it engraved design a scavenger hunt decide upon where you want the scavenger hunt to end which will be at a place where the two of you will do something together that the other person really enjoys it might be at a bowling alley movie theater restaurant or even a river where you can canoe then start creating clues that are relevant or significant to the other person or to you and the other person for example they might be inside jokes memories things you ve discussed doing etc write or print them on whatever type of paper or material will be appropriate for their locations the first for example might be on a piece of scratch paper taped to the bathroom mirror while the third might need to be laminated or even put in a jar because it s buried by the tree you used to climb as kids don t tell the other person the scavenger hunt is your apology go to your ending point before the scavenger hunt begins and drop off a bunch of balloons that say i m sorry include a gift if you want and express your apologies before spending the day having fun together if this isn t possible get just one balloon stuff it in your pocket blow it up when you arrive and give it to the other person along with your

can make choosing your colors patterns and fonts a lot easier you can match the theme to the party the person s interests or come up with your own theme here are some ideas to get you started if you want to use a train theme consider making a pennant banner with square pennants each pennant will make a train cart make a train engine shape to use at the front of your banner for an underwater theme use lots of blues and greens use some fish and bubble stickers around the letters for a princess theme consider what sort of princess this is typical princess colors are pink and silver but if your princess is from a specific movie you might want to use the colors from her dress instead consider what the person likes does he or she have a favorite food animal color book or movie choose one of those and design your banner around that play with font you can use a standard block letter font or a fancy italic or cursive font larger thicker fonts might be more appealing to children if your

some ideas to get you started if you are making a pennant banner for a snow themed party and you have blank pennants between the words consider gluing a snowflake onto the blank pennant if you are painting a banner for a superhero themed party consider adding a border using comic book strips you can also buy comic book themed scrapbooking paper instead if you don t want to sacrifice any old comic books if you are making a banner for someone who likes the ocean consider filling in any blank spaces with images of fish shells and sea bubbles choose your paper the best paper to use for this is cardstock you can find it in the scrapbook section of an arts and crafts store it comes in many different colors you can also use construction paper but it will not be as bright and it will not be as durable trace your letter shapes onto the paper 1 x research source find some large stencils and use them to trace the letters onto your paper you should be able to fit several letters onto one page make sure that the letters are several inches high you want to be able to read the banner easily from across the room try to use a pencil while tracing so that you can erase the lines later you can also print the letter outlines out onto the paper if you are using cardstock feed one sheet at a time through your printer cut the letters out you can use scissors or a sharp craft knife be sure to cut just inside the lines you made when tracing the letter if you see any pencil marks be sure to erase them measure and cut your string the string needs to be long enough to fit all of the letters plus an additional 12 inches 30 48 centimeters at each end this will allow you to hang the banner arrange your letters they can be as close together or as far apart as you like they will hang better however if you include some space between each letter glue the letters to the banner flip the letters over draw a thin line of glue along the top edge of each letter press the string down into the glue you can also use clear tape to stick the string to the back of the letters if you are short on time let the glue dry before hanging the banner depending on the type of glue you used this can take anywhere from a few hours to a whole day choose your paper you can use any type of paper you want to make your pennants the best paper to use is scrapbooking paper because it is very colorful cardstock is also a good option because it is sturdy the paper can be all one color or multiple colors make sure you have enough paper to spell out your message you will need one sheet of paper for each letter in your message you will also need an extra sheet for the spaces between each word create a template for the pennants using thick cardstock paper you can use almost any shape you want but the most popular shapes are circles triangles and rectangles make the template a few inches larger than the letters you are planning on using it needs to be large enough so that you can easily read it across the room if you are using a rectangle consider cutting a shape into the bottom 2 x research source trace the template onto the back of each paper and cut the shapes out use a pencil if you can once you have cut the shapes out erase any pencil marks that are still visible these will be your pennants you will be sticking the letters onto these if you could not find a pencil cut the shapes out just inside the lines you have made consider cutting a smaller version of the pennant shape and gluing it down onto the pennant first use a contrasting color this will create a sort of frame around the letter to do this take your template and cut it smaller all around by ½ to 1 inch 1 27 to 2 54 centimeters trace the template onto contrasting sheets of paper cut the shapes out and attach them to the center of each pennant you can use glue or clear double sided tape create your letters and stick them down onto the pennants the letters need to be several inches high but smaller than the pennants you will need one letter for pennant consider using a contrasting color to make them more visible here are some ideas on what you can use for the letters use some large letter stickers paint the letters on using stencils and acrylic paint cut the letters out of paper and glue them on you can even use glitter scrapbooking paper for some extra sparkle choose and cut your string choose a thin string such as baker s twine yarn or balloon ribbon plan on leaving about 12 inches 30 48 centimeters of string at the front and end of your banner so that you can hang it consider weaving some string through the pennants 3 x research source this method will work best on triangle and square shaped pennants use a hole punch to poke a hole in each top corner then weave the ribbon through the holes like so push the string down through the left hole bring the string across the back of the pennant pull the string up through the right hole push the string down through the left hole of the next pennant bring it across the back of the pennant and pull it back up through the right hole keep doing this until you have no more pennants consider taping the string to the back of your banner 4 x research source flip the shape over and lay the string across the back position it about ½ inch 1 27 centimeters below the top edge secure it in place with a long piece of clear tape the tape should go from one side of the shape to the other if you are using a rectangle shape tape the string 1 inch 2 54 centimeters down from the top edge fold the top edge back by 1 inch 2 54 centimeters on top of the string secure it with glue or clear double sided tape wait for any glue and paint to dry before hanging the banner depending on what you used this can take anywhere between a few hours to a whole day buy enough butcher paper to fit your message you can find colorful butcher paper online in teacher supply stores and in certain university college art stores regular arts and crafts stores may not sell butcher paper you can also use fabric instead but you may want to hem the edges so that they do not fray white butcher paper may seem plain but it will give you a nice canvas to work on draw some guidelines on the paper using a pencil and ruler draw lightly with the pencil so that you can erase the marks easier later on this will help ensure that your words are straight and not crooked lightly sketch out your message using a pencil you don t have to get the font right at this point just try to get the rough shape and size this will help you position the stencils later on again remember to draw lightly so that the pencil does not show through the paint place your stencil where you want it some stencils will have a sticky back and will stay put while you paint if your stencil moves around too much tape the edges down using painter s tape paint over the stencil using acrylic paint you can use a foam brush or a stencil brush to apply the paint apply the paint using a light tapping motion try not to apply too much paint at once you can always apply another coat or two if you apply too much paint at once the paint may leak under the stencil and create puddles if you are painting on fabric use fabric paint instead move the stencil over to the next letter you may want to start out by painting every other letter first then going back and painting the missing letters this will give the paint time to dry and you won t have to worry about accidentally touching and smearing wet paint let the paint dry before you hang the banner depending on what type of paint you used this can take anywhere between 20 minutes to 2 hours hang your banner up by either taping or tacking it to the wall open a new file in photoshop and set the dimensions for your banner don t worry about making your banner super large you can always make it bigger later your local print shop should also be able to print the banner larger consider starting out with a 500 by 200 pixel banner use the fill tool to set a background color if desired you can find the fill tool on the side menu it looks like a paint bucket you can leave the background white or you can make it a different color you can also choose to add a gradient to create a gradient right click on the paint bucket and select the gradient option choose the two colors you want they are located at the bottom of the side menu click on your banner drag down a little and let go select the type tool you can find it on the side menu it usually looks like a letter t click on it and then click on your background where you want the text to be choose the font color and size of your text you can find these options along the top of the screen for the color consider choosing something that contrasts with the background type out your birthday message if the text is not to your liking highlight it and change it by choosing the font options located along the top of the screen save your file onto your computer and a usb flash drive you will want to save it as a photoshop document first this will keep the layers intact so that you can return to them and change them if necessary you will also want to save a printable version of your file this will usually be a jpeg or pdf file check with your local print shop to see what sorts of files they can print take the usb flash drive with you to your local print shop to print it from there you will be able to choose the paper you want it printed on you will also be able to choose the size as well use colorful paper bags get enough colorful paper bags to spell out your message make sure that all of the bags are the same size stick one letter to the front of each bag you can use letter stickers or cut your own letters out of colorful paper and glue them on use paper cups get enough colored paper cups to spell out your message stick one letter onto the front of each cup use clothespins to secure the cups to a lone piece of ribbon you can cut your own letters out of colorful paper and stick them onto the cups using glue you can also use large letter stickers use balloons get enough clear latex balloons to spell out your message fill each balloon with a handful of colorful paper confetti blow the balloons up and tie the ends into knots stick one letter onto each balloon tie the balloons onto a long piece of string to create a birthday banner garland 5 x research source the balloons must be clear or the confetti won t show rub the balloons across some carpet or your hair this will create static and make the confetti spread out you can use giant letter stickers poster letters or vinyl letter stickers use paper doilies to make the pennants when making a pennant banner consider using paper doilies you can fold them in half over the string and glue them in place or you can tape them you can also secure the doilies to the string using clothespins use delicate cursive or italic letter stickers in a contrasting color to form your message use colorful clothespins to attach pennants to string instead of using tape or glue try pinning the pennants to the string instead this will give you a more rustic look which can work well with country burlap and shabby chic themes,Holidays-and-Traditions

your supplies if you re holding the party at an outdoor venue don t forget to bring tables and chairs,focus on the person s age when choosing decorations you can use this theme for any birthday but it works especially well for first birthdays and other milestone birthdays like turning 16 30 or 40 go with banners balloons and party favors that announce the person s age and make sure that the age number appears prominently throughout the décor for example for a first birthday the décor and party favors can feature the number 1 or say happy 1st birthday on them the cake and mylar balloons can be shaped like the number 1 as well you can also base color choices on the age for example a sweet 16 party can be decorated in shades of pink black and gold decorations are popular for 40th birthday parties with an over the hill theme base the theme around the season for an easy option seasonal themes are great options that never go out of style they re also extremely customizable and you should be able to find decorations at your local craft store or online quickly and easily if you aren t sure what kind of theme to go with or if you don t have much time for planning consider a seasonal theme for example a summer birthday party can have a tropical color scheme and feature beach themed decorations if the party is in the fall you could have a burgundy brown and orange color scheme and use autumn themed decorations featuring leaves pumpkins cornucopias and pinecones 1 x research source the season can also dictate activities for the party for example you can have pumpkin carving or pumpkin painting activities at a kids autumn themed party bobbing for apples is another fun idea for fall feature a favorite animal sports team or other interest in the décor you probably know the person well enough to pinpoint one of their favorite hobbies or interests but if you aren t that close to them don t be afraid to ask someone who would know finding decorations that match a very specific or obscure interest may not be feasible at your local craft store so try looking online instead for example a child who loves unicorns might love a unicorn themed party with unicorn imagery and pastel decorations if the person loves harry potter or star wars you could go with decorations that reflect those interests a football or hockey themed party would work great for a sports lover and you can even zero in on a specific team and use the team colors for your color scheme create a disney themed party with decorations featuring their favorite disney characters and settings 2 x

themed party create a scroll shaped banner with a message like hear ye hear ye it s the queen s birthday 5 x research source for a disco themed party you could have a banner with an iconic disco quote

lights that come with battery packs if you don t have access to electricity attach lightweight chinese paper lanterns to the string in between the lights to create even more ambiance cover the tables with craft paper for a homemade vibe tape a large piece of white craft paper or construction paper onto the tabletops and scatter crayons and markers across the surfaces so that party goers can write messages and draw pictures this works great for children s parties and the covers can be easily saved as a keepsake 11 x research source taping the paper down will prevent it from being blown away by

how to celebrate an 18th birthday,for many people turning 18 is a big milestone with new rights and new responsibilities 18 year olds are officially considered adults in many cultures so you ll want to celebrate the right way learning to throw the right kind of party whether you want to have an informal gathering with your family and stay in or throw a big party or head out on the town you can celebrate in style,release the kid in you why not invite some friends over and have a birthday party hang streamers balloons eat cake play games and watch movies just because you are now considered an adult by law does not mean you lose your youth enjoy the time with people you love if you want to have a more adult 18th birthday party there are also plenty of ways to celebrate your new found freedom consider a quiet party some people don t require a big blow out when they turn 18 spending a few quiet hours at home with your family opening presents eating cake if it worked for 17 years nothing needs to change now spend time with the people who love you and relax make it quality time organize some spa time with a sibling or parent or spend time working on cars with your dad do something you d normally do but take the time to really appreciate it most people assume that turning 18 means that these moments will start to dissipate but that isn t entirely true you can make them last even if you start taking on new responsibilities make a list of the childhood things you d like to do and use your 18th as an opportunity to do all of the things you ve always loved doing hang out with your brother and watch samurai movies late or go to your favorite ice cream spot with the family remember turning 18 has more responsibilities but you don t have to stop being a kid try a less common party activity like camping you can do this at a park with camping spots or even in your own backyard grab a tent some snacks some video games and a few good friends it s like an all night hangout but without your parent s over your shoulder if you want to camp in a park tent spots are usually about 15 a night give or take this can be a great way to bond with your friends while also tasting freedom away from your parents invite a manageable number of people one good way of celebrating an 18th is throwing a house party for yourself depending on the house you ve got available you may want to have a big throw down or a smaller gathering appropriate for your purposes whatever you want to do make sure you invite an appropriate number of people so you won t have a big crowd spilling onto your lawn and attracting cops if you talk about your party on facebook or other social networking keep it to private messages don t post about your party publicly or you may have unwanted guests and attention consider celebrating multiple 18ths at the same time if a couple friends are all turning 18 mash up all your parties together to get one big throw down rather than a few smaller parties think epic think up a theme set up your party with a style that suits your theme or your own personal taste you could keep it elegant and tasteful with some nice flower arrangements photos and crepe or you could do it up with a smoke machine disco ball and a trap dj for a grimy dance party maybe you want mason jars full of lemonade a bluegrass band and hay bales decide what kind of vibe you want for your part and go with it quick tip change your light bulbs from the standard white to red or yellow and set the tone to the house party quickly cleanly and cheaply prepare your house properly by tucking away all your valuables and things that may get knocked over place them in a lockable room or move things into the garage or a shed think about clean up if you ve got to start scrubbing goo off the floor after the jello wrestling tank overflowed you might have a bad start to your 18th year try to keep it manageable set up the entertainment for the night it s important to have something for your guests to do at your party this could be anything from games to dancing to movies to cooking it s your night so pick something that you will enjoy doing with your closest friends choose something that you and your friends will enjoy doing if you re a gamer set up a video game gauntlet and move from room to room in an epic circuit super nintendo in the attic and xbox one in the living room game your way from floor to floor if you want to hire a dj remember to give them a list of songs to play that you like and your guests will appreciate as your guests arrive you can always have them write down two or three of their favorite dancing songs and this will ensure they get up and get the party started if you go with a live band it s essential that you make sure they ll have enough room electrical hook ups and other materials necessary to play especially if you re going to pay for it make sure they re there early to set up warn the neighbors nothing ruins a party faster than a call to the cops and a knock on the door it s common courtesy to warn your neighbors that you re going to have a party and let them know the specific details go around the neighborhood to make sure you ll be in the clear pro tip don t treat it so much like a warning and treat it more like an invitation tell the neighbors you re going to have a party for your 18th and that you wanted to let them know they should stop by slide a little caveat in there not expecting too many people but there ll probably be some music we ll try to have it over with at a reasonable hour hope to see you there only invite a selected number of friends 18 is a huge milestone so grab some friends and make a night of it try to keep your group to a wolf pack sized crew no more than five or so close friends and hit the town if you go out always travel in a group make reservations if you ve got a big party to make sure you ll get into the restaurant club or other venue you want to get into if it requires tickets buy tickets ahead of time if it requires a cover charge make sure everyone s got cash depending on when you turn 18 this might be one of the last chances you have to catch up with your close friends before college or before jobs start it might be fun to head to a loud dance club but it might also be fun to just hang out quietly and talk do what feels natural find an over 18 club if your town has one finding an 18 and over club can be a great way to explore the town and have some fun theses types of clubs are usually like most dance venues but without alcohol lots of venues will have 18 listed as the minimum age and if there s an event that happens around your birthday it can be a great way to celebrate while it might be fun for you also try to plan on underage members of your group don t make plans to go anywhere that everyone can t go or just invite people who are over 18 do a little planning to make sure nobody will be left out get a ride from place to place before you head out make sure you know how you ll get from place to place and that you ve got your rides arranged best to let someone else drive especially if you re going to be drinking at all but even if you re not taking away the stress of driving around can make the whole evening a lot easier and more fun taking a cab is a safe bet or arranging rides with family members or other close friends but if you want to make your 18th epic there s always the possibility of a limo if your town has access using lyft or uber is a great way of getting from place to place you can arrange to have a car meet you somewhere at a specific time take lots of pictures in a couple years you ll definitely want to make sure that you documented your 18th it s easier than ever these days but don t forget to snap enough group pictures to keep track of everything you do this night the pictures will be priceless have fun but stay safe your 18th should be a night of freedom and fun but if you re going out you need to be extremely safe always stay in a group make sure everyone s exchanged numbers before you go out and let your parents or someone else close to you know where you re planning on going and what you re planning on doing make sure you start your birthday out on the right foot figure out what s newly legal in your area depending on where you live there may be a whole host of newly legal things for you to try to explore as a freshly minted adult whether you re planning a party for someone who s about to turn 18 or planning your own get together it s common for it to include some kind of thing you couldn t do when you were 17 in some countries 18 is the legal drinking age if you re going to have a few drinks to celebrate make sure you drink safely and don t test your limits you ve got a whole lifetime of legal drinking ahead of you no need to cram it in all at once lottery tickets tattoos tobacco products marriage licenses military enlistment and voter registration are all things that 18 year olds suddenly have at their disposal in most areas learn what s available in yours and plan to celebrate like an adult in many areas turning 18 means you have to get a new driver s license or id card in some states and provinces it s a different color with different designations while it might not be a fun way to celebrate it s a good idea to get your new id as soon as possible buy a lotto ticket one of the first things lots of 18 year olds do is buy up a lottery ticket or two it can be a fast and fun way to do something with your new id and your new adulthood buy up a scratch off or a power ball card and have some harmless fun who knows you might even win a little folding money to help fund your party consider a birthday tattoo 18 year olds don t need parental consent to get a tattoo legally while it s not necessarily recommended that you get a tattoo just because you can if you ve been settled on a design for a long time and are really serious about getting one it s a common way of celebrating your birthday research a good artist in your area have a meet up to talk about your design and schedule an appointment for your 18th register to vote yeah yeah it s not the stuff of parties but spending the pre party portion of your day doing newly adult things might be an exciting and fun way to celebrate exercise your rights by

how to celebrate a 21st birthday,ah adulthood you only turn 21 once so learning how to plan for an epic evening of legal drinking and fun requires a bit of planning you can learn to enjoy those first drinks and stay safe whether you re going out or staying in to party you can also plan a super fun dry party for yourself if you re not interested or able to imbibe it s your birthday plan it like you want see step 1 for a variety of options and ways to stay safe on your birthday,take it slow you re 21 you should be excited and probably anxious to get your first legal taste of alcohol in public but try to remember that you ll be of legal drinking age for the rest of your life you don t have to drink all the drinks at once starting the rest of that life with a two day hangover isn t probably the best idea prepare for a long night of fun and don t rush into things especially when it comes to alcohol a good rule of thumb is that you should have no more than one drink per hour to keep a handle on your sobriety although alcohol affects everyone differently different strengths of alcohol can sneak up on you more quickly while some take a while to show effects keeping it to around one and no more than two drinks per hour will help keep most people in control of their faculties one drink in an evening can be enough to register above limit on a breathalyzer test and one drink is often enough to get one person tipsy always use extreme caution any time you re drinking alcohol and never drive under any circumstances after consuming learn about what you re drinking different drinks work in different ways so it s important to get informed about the differences in the types of alcohol you ll find at a bar or a liquor store if you re not familiar already a shot is usually about 1 5 ounces of hard liquor and the average liquor is about 40 alcohol by volume or 80 proof a beer is usually about 12 ounces although beer is often served in pint glasses which are slightly larger regular beers and light beers like budweiser coors or other beers are usually between 2 and 5 alcohol by volume while certain microbrews can be much higher 6 8 in some cases drinking a single heavy indiana pale ale for example will have about as much alcohol as two bud lites a glass of wine is about 4 ounces usually and is usually between 12 and 18 alcohol by volume depending on the variety cocktails are mixtures of different hard liquors flavored liqueurs sodas fruit juices and other liquids depending on the cocktail itself most cocktails contain one or two shots worth of hard liquor however ask the bartender for more specific information beer is an extremely popular choice for 21 year olds but you should know what the alcohol content is most of them are between 4 5 percent but some are 7 9 percent or more which makes a huge difference do not go for strong beer if you will be drinking loads that night because you will get drunk much faster and more likely to suffer a severe hangover the next day use caution eat something first and drink plenty of water never drink alcohol on an empty stomach before you decide to have your first drinks get something substantial to eat first and try to stay hydrated throughout the evening if you re planning on having a couple going out for a meal at a restaurant that serves alcohol can be a great way of doing both things at once eggs are an excellent precursor to a night of drinking because they contain cysteine which helps to break down alcohol in your system pickles are also an excellent choice which contain salts and electrolytes which alcohol depletes in your body drink at least one glass of water for every drink of alcohol you have hangovers are primarily the result of dehydration and it s possible to head a troubling morning after off at the pass by drinking enough water throughout the night celebrate with friends you can trust if you re going out and planning on drinking it s especially important that you re going out with a trusted group of friends who you re confident won t take advantage of you in an inebriated state don t celebrate with people who will test your limits or push you into doing things you don t want to do bring a supportive and trustworthy group along for the fun who ll be able to take care of you if necessary if you re in a large group at least one person should be sober or in the neighborhood of sober if everyone else is getting out of control it s important that there be at least one voice of reason or one good candidate to talk to the cops when the show up at the house if you re going anywhere you must designate a driver to remain sober and act as the chauffeur even one or two drinks can be enough to register on a breathalyzer test leading to a bummer of a birthday night the cops don t care that it s your special night never leave a drink unattended especially true at bars but equally true at house parties it s important that you keep your drink with you at all times go up to the bar to get your own drinks never accept drinks offered by strangers and abandon drinks that you re unsure about tainted drinks or drinks spiked with sedatives and other drugs are an unfortunately common occurrence at bars and inexperienced 21 year olds make an easy target have fun but keep your friends close and stay safe don t mix different kinds of alcohol together everyone reacts differently to different types of alcohol especially depending on your body type and your sex men process alcohol much differently than women do when you re first learning about your tolerance it s best to not jump around doing a couple beers a shot then a glass of wine then a cocktail it makes it harder to keep track of what you ve already had to drink and control your sobriety a classic drinkers slogan goes beer before liquor never sicker liquor before beer no fear the order of drinks being consumed has no effect however on your inebriation compared to the amount of liquor consumed it s perfectly possible to get a nasty hangover by taking a shot before a beer prepare for recovery before you go out stock up for the possibility of a rough morning even if you re planning on taking it easy after a night of drinking it s common that you might experience some nausea headache and sensitivity to sound and light the result of dehydration and a lowered electrolyte count by preparing correctly though you can get on top of your hangover quickly and salvage the day drink a sports drink in the morning if you re feeling dehydrated cut with water to make it more palatable if necessary the sugar and the electrolytes will help to replenish what the alcohol sapped from your body 1 x research source try to get something on your stomach the next morning even if it s just some dry toast kickstarting your metabolism is essential to starting recovery if you need to take an ibuprofen also you ll need to have something on your stomach mixing ibuprofen with alcohol can irritate the stomach lining stay safe if you re going to welcome yourself to adulthood by having an all out crazy celebration of your self and your ability to consume the boozes legally you have to do it with a plan for staying safe and for being a little responsible if you re going to party you might as well party right bring a go bag with you have some emergency supplies on hand in a backpack purse or other carrying case energy drink sports drink prophylactic extra keys extra cash cellphone charger toothbrush and list of emergency numbers never a bad idea let several people know your plans for the night in case things go awry let a neighbor a parent a housemate or someone else you trust know where you ll be what you re planning on doing and what to do in an emergency it s not lame to take care of yourself designate a driver if you re going to celebrate your 21st with a night on the town and you re planning on having a couple drinks make a designated driver the first priority elect a friend to stay sober and chauffeur you around in exchange for a free dinner if necessary if you live in the city walk around take public transportation or use taxi cabs to travel if you ve got the funds a limo is always a great party option don t drive after drinking under any circumstances before you go out program the number of late night taxi services into your phone that way if you end up unsure about how to get around you can call quickly and easily and make sure that you ll be safe if you re walking home late at night always walk in a group and make sure that everyone gets home safely make sure that everyone in your group has already exchanged numbers before setting out for the night in case you get separated pick a place or hop around depending on your plants it might be fun to hit up a bunch of different places in a small area head to a few special locations or pick the perfect spot and hole up there for the evening all approaches can be fun ways to party if you want to bar crawl find an area that s densely packed with cool bars so you won t have to worry about transporting yourself in between them and can walk start by eating dinner at the brew pup and trying a flight of the house made beers to see what you like then have an after dinner cocktail at the fancy bar across the street and finish off the night with cheap drinks and pool at the dive a few blocks away alternatively find one place and warn them you re coming if you ve got a favorite restaurant pick somewhere you ll be able to have a good meal accommodate a large group and hang out afterward for drinks if necessary a super trendy or popular restaurant might not want a huge table taking up space for an entire evening you ll probably want to call ahead to make a reservation and let them know how many people will be attending travel somewhere no place close by where you want to party go where the party is if you plan it out far enough ahead of time and have the funds to pay for lodging heading somewhere exotic for a birthday celebration will make sure you kick off your drinking years in style in america las vegas and new orleans are great towns in which to turn 21 with a big party culture plenty to do for leisure and friendly open container laws if you head to europe or elsewhere know that turning 21 carries less of a cultural significance than in the united states since the drinking age is usually different it ll still be a blast for you but shouting that you re 21 and waving your id in peoples faces will probably just earn some confused looks for example the drinking age in continental europe is between 16 18 depending on what you choose to drink but in the uk it is 18 decide how much money you re willing to spend it s your birthday so you re the one who gets to decide how classy trashy or somewhere in between your birthday is going to be your sister might be after you to eat raw oysters at some fancy seaside resort when all you want to do is hang out with your friends consider the guests the venues and the type of partying you re after when considering the cost classy option plan an exclusive wine tasting with a few close friends and get dressed up in fancy clothes for your 21st then score reservations at a trendy small plate restaurant back in town and sample deserts with after dinner cocktails somewhere else make like you re in sex and the city and live it up right make it less about getting drunk and more about becoming an adult if you happen to get a little tipsy in the process all the better budget option it s always a popular option to throw a campy bar crawl frat style hit up the rankest dive bars in your town with 20 friends throw darts and dance wearing plastic leis and end the night with some late night taco bell it s about memories not spending a ton of money cut loose and have a blast on the cheap keep your plans loose it s good to make plans but no night on the town should feel like a forced march if you make reservations at too many different places and have a really specific list of cocktails appetizers and different things you want to try before a certain hour it can seem less like a party and more like work remember that you re supposed to have fun and try to allow some time to fly by the seat of your pants if you have to make reservations make one for dinner and go there first before you do anything else afterwards leave some of your plans up in the air make sure at least one person has a smart phone and can look things up on the fly one fun way of celebrating can be to turn over the decision making process to someone else and let them plan everything that way you can be free to sit back and party where you re going next who cares let someone else lead the way have fun but don t be obnoxious turning 21 might seem like the biggest deal in the world to you right now but the guy trying to get a quick bite and a beer after work probably doesn t want to be hassled by 20 drunk college kids and the wait staff is probably just trying to get through their shift as quickly as possible don t make a scene and try to be as considerate as possible with others leave a big tip if you ve got a big party if you ve got a big group of drunk people making lots of noise mess and drawing lots of attention to itself you need to compensate your servers with a generous tip if the party is big enough an automatic tip may be included but consider going above in some cases if you can afford it if you ve got a large unwieldy party that s hopping between bars try a helpful friend making trick buy drinks for strangers a table trying to have a quiet dinner keeps making annoyed faces at your table don t make a big deal out of it or complain send them another round on your tab and show a little class pay the fun forward if it s your 21st fill a bag with 21 beers and give them out to people at the bar you re worried you might have annoyed like souvenirs for your party they ll chill out be the beer fairy try the midnight to midnight some people like to start partying at the first possible minute make your 21st birthday start the last night of your 20th by waiting until the very moment the clock strikes midnight to show your id to the bouncer at a bar walk in a liberated 21 year old if you want to get especially ambitious some people try to keep the party going for all 24 hours of your actual birthday that means you ve got to keep partying until the following midnight if you do this the name of the game is hydration schedule some down time to drink a couple gatorades catch up on some bad tv and chill out no one can survive 24 hours of straight drinking know when to pack it in eventually your birthday s going to have to end and it s better that it ends safely and probably sooner rather than later some bars can get a little hairy in the after hours and it s not usually a good idea to get caught out too late make sure you stay in a group and head home at a reasonable hour before you go out give yourself a loose curfew so you won t have to worry about decided when to go home later call a cab ahead of time and arrange for it to arrive when you d like to leave then you can enjoy your night worry free stock up and batten down the hatches if you re finally 21 a house party can be a great way to ring in the year head to the liquor store and stock up on a variety of booze invite enough friends to tear the place down and get a dj party time you only get so many opportunities in life to throw a kegger your 21st is the most obvious invite lots of people make sure they re all over 21 and drink a giant keg of beer together clear everything out of the living room to make a party space hiding anything breakable or anything your roommates don t want stolen if you re going to throw a loud party with music warn your neighbors and get on their good side to avoid an uncomfortable house call from the police late at night try to be considerate of your neighbors and let them know what you re planning and try to cut it off at an appropriate hour try to resist the urge to supply your underage friends will alcohol if you re the first of your crew to turn 21 maybe having a house party isn t the best idea throw a themed costume party if you decide to throw yourself a 21st bash at home you can afford to get a whole lot weirder than if you go out that means costumes games maybe even feats of strength who knows you only turn 21 once some great time tested theme parties include dork party tell everyone to dress up as their favorite video game character super hero or other nerd related theme wait for hilarity to ensue throwback party make like it s 1984 and make everyone wear washed out jeans ugly sweaters and big perm style hair listen to flock of seagulls and discuss reaganomics over wine coolers good times toga party a time tested classic probably just as popular when your parents turned 21 at a toga party everyone wraps themselves in a sheet as if they were at the roman coliseum drink ambrosia coconut rum orange juice pineapple juice and carry on regally heaven and hell party this only works if you ve got three floors put champagne and wine on the top floor beer on the ground level and liquor in the basement if it s your party you play god and send people to respective places box party separate everyone into different groups preferably into small groups with strangers they won t know everyone has to go into a different room in that room is a box in that box is a kind of alcohol the group cannot leave the room until the alcohol is gone the alcohol it should be noted should be something gross like smirnoff ice or blue raspberry jello shots do a time lapse photo project while you re partying on your 21st take a picture of yourself every hour on the hour with a disposable camera when you get the pictures developed later it ll be a hilarious documentary of the night and may even jog loose some almost forgotten memories who s that wearing a hockey mask and wiping bean dip all over their face oh it s you play a drinking game a great way to liven up a 21st house party is to play a drinking game you can make one up as you go along or you can play a classic if you re just recently turned 21 you should never play a drinking game with hard alcohol stick to beer and take a tiny sip when a drink gets doled out otherwise drinking games can quickly overwhelm your tolerance making them dangerous played safely drinking games can be a lot of fun though some of the time tested and party approved include king s cup in this game you ll need a deck of cards and a big communal mug each card represents a different action and the players go around the circle drawing cards sometimes you ll have to drink sometimes you ll have to pour some of whatever you re drinking into the mug and sometimes you ll have to freestyle rap whoever draws the last king from the deck chucks the mug you can also make up rules as you go along good times play quarters this simple game involves trying to land quarters into drinks and doling out drinks to the other participants accordingly it s like an adult version of tiddlywinks play a movie themed drinking game watch star wars and take a sip every time luke complains about something or watch an episode of seinfeld and take a drink every time kramer says something that doesn t make sense watch the local news and take a drink every time someone says the name of your town use edward 40 hands with caution in this game two 40 oz bottles of malt liquor are taped into the players hands and the bottles cannot be removed until both are gone it can be a hilarious house party game and it can also end with someone smashing a bottle on the bathroom floor and crying probably not best for a 21st build a beer mountain a house party is a great opportunity to make booze art before everyone gets there spend some time with your roommates building an elaborate robot out of the beer cans that everyone will drink or make a birthday cake that is made of beers instead of cutting the cake everyone should have a beer as you start to accumulate empties use them to make wizard staffs taping the cans together make the two people with the longest staffs fight each other in a wizard s duel or use all the empties to make a big tower of cans and act out scenes from lord of the

frowned upon in others plan to visit beforehand to lend a hand with cleaning decorating and preparing for the party do not leave this for the guest of honor to do hold the party at the home of a

should be capable of doing at what stage of your personal life or career you should be and so forth 8 x research source these guidelines can be helpful to a certain point but if more than anything

by studying as many of the digits of pi as you can use your artistic side to celebrate pi you don t have to be a left brained thinker to fully celebrate pi you can use your creative side to show how much you love and appreciate pi and even if you re not the world s most talented poet or writer you can still have fun while being silly you don t have to create art to celebrate pi you can also just appreciate art that already celebrates it here are a few ways to celebrate pi artistically write poetry write either a pi ku haiku or a regular pi em poem to show how much you love pi write a pi themed song and sing it or write a short pi themed skit and act it out paint a picture of pi watch movies related to pi try the film π it s an interesting and dark movie about a mathematician who goes crazy but intended for an adult audience only you could also watch the film life of pi 5 x research source technically pi is only the protagonist s name but it has gotten people thinking about pi

pi for unknown reasons get physical with pi you can also use your physical prowess or even your car to show your love for pi here are a few things you can do to celebrate pi do a pi mile run run 3 14 miles 5 05 km which is just a tiny bit longer than a 5k you can take this a step further by organizing a pi mile run with friends or colleagues lay down in pi formation and take a picture if you re

minute you can cheer wildly or even have a countdown leading up to pi minute the minute before for added effect for a countdown have a pi drop where you drop a big pie off a balcony or another elevated structure you can even add a lot of sprinkles to the pie to make it look like a disco ball if you ve written a pi song or made a pi dance this would be the perfect minute to share your art note that there is some debate regarding the exact time that pi day should be celebrated though 1 59pm is probably the most common some believe that the 24 hour clock should be used instead which would mean that pi day should be celebrated at 1 59am or 15 09pm convert things into pi this step is absolutely necessary for two reasons first to utterly confuse people who have no idea what you re talking about and secondly to have fun seeing how many things can be referenced with pi this will help you reach an even higher appreciation for the amazing number that is pi consider two approaches use pi to tell the time convert naturally circular things into radians like the hours on the clock instead of it being 3 o clock now it s 1 2 pi o clock or instead of it being 3 o clock convert the inclination of the sun into radians and describe that as the time simply use 3 14 as a unit of measure instead of being 31 years old you are 9pi years old with this same approach you can find out your next pi birthday just don t forget to celebrate it when it comes help the tradition continue don t let this be a one time thing you owe it to pi to celebrate again and again set the date for next year and consider creating a pi club or website in the process talk about your plans for pi day the following year this will help generate enthusiasm take notes after your pi day celebration what can you do next year to make your celebration even more incredible next year talk about the day months in advance so your skeptical friends can be convinced to join in you can even advertise for the event by emailing your closest friends or even setting up a pi day facebook page,Holidays-and-Traditions

how to celebrate hobbit day,september 22 is the birthday of the famous hobbits bilbo and frodo baggins in recognition of these endearing characters created by j r r tolkien this date has come to be known as hobbit day so that fans of hobbits everywhere can pause and celebrate the delight that is a hobbit so if you re one of those very people who wants to take one day this year to honor the fine race of hobbits here are some ideas to help you celebrate,plan a long expected party with fellow hobbit fans this refers to the chapter one of the fellowship of the ring in the book this party involves bilbo baggins birthday his departure and gandalf farewelling frodo baggins in your case it is just a great excuse to have a party some of the things to set the scene might include decorating with a pile of packages to represent the wagon that is laden with packages in the story as well as piles of presents fireworks or at least sparklers it s not likely you can recreate one in the image of a dragon but at least consider having a flag or a poster with a dragon on it lanterns for lighting would be reminiscent of the book have dancing music songs and games decide where to hold the party if you have a large tree in your backyard or in a nearby park consider making it the party tree an outdoor hobbit party is probably more in keeping with the tradition of big hobbit events than trying to cram everyone indoors but obviously this will depend on where you live and the weather the benefit of being outdoors is the juvenile hobbits can run around without feeling cooped up and all crumbs can be eaten by the creatures of the earth without the need to vacuum up if you decide to hold the party in a house put up pictures or decorations with a hobbit theme there are plenty of images that you can print out from online images to use in your private home environment and you can embellish these with computer photo programs if needed make sure that your festivities include a good amount of food either a large meal or various snack foods hobbits were known for their many well stocked pantries as was made known on the first page of the hobbit food that might be perfect for a hobbit celebration includes unsurprisingly much of it seems like traditional english fare mushrooms these are favorite hobbit food and farmer maggot used to grow them and frodo got caught trying to steal some wine bilbo and frodo both inherited vineyards beer is also popular with hobbits hot soup cold meats mince pies pork pies rabbit fish and chips rashers of bacon blackberry tarts and other blackberry foods including uncooked blackberries freshly baked bread and lots of butter pickles are often mentioned ripe cheese food made from vegetables such as corn turnips carrots potatoes and onions food made with apples such as apple tart with raspberry jam honey foods made with honey such as honey cakes would be nice scones known as biscuits in north america fruit pies and cakes including seed cakes pinwheel sandwiches just because these are small and cute and the hobbits may have approved provided they weren t too fussy tea and coffee keep seasonings and sauces to a minimum apparently hobbits didn t bother with them that much choose a passage or more about hobbits from one of tolkien s books to read aloud together this is important for both fans and non initiates alike the fans will know the passages and the non initiate will be introduced to the way of hobbits through listening ask someone with an excellent projecting voice who enjoys reading in public to read out the passages so it s enjoyable for everyone play games hobbits loved games so a party celebrating hobbits needs to have plenty of these going you could start by putting a hobbit name on each guest s back and making people figure out who they are just by asking questions of other guests no peeking other games to consider include and each of these can be made suitable for any age with an imagination backyard party games like quoits horseshoe tossing beanbag throwing sack jumping egg and spoon race three legged race coconut shy etc indoor games like musical chairs pass the parcel the chocolate game pin the tail on the donkey statues chinese whispers etc play rhyming games and making up haiku poems limericks etc play games that involve riddles charades sayings or proverbs have a special cake as well as all the other scrumptious food don t forget that hobbit day is also a birthday party for bilbo and frodo make or purchase a special birthday cake with two candles one for each hobbit for fun you might toast the bagginses and make little speeches in their honor give away lovely things to everyone who comes to the party small but creative gifts such as toys jewelry trinkets small musical instruments puzzles etc should be given to the guests this represents one of the peaceful pursuits of hobbits gift giving and is the spirit of sharing and creating community both valued by hobbits see how to make a birthday goodie bag for adults how to put together a goodie bag how to sew a cloth gift bag and how to make gift bags for more ideas if you do not think your friends would be very interested in a hobbit day celebration celebrate the day in your own way walk around barefoot for the day eat about six meals hobbits are always hungry or make a hobbit day t shirt to spread awareness consider making flyers to share with friends and acquaintances to help them understand the importance of this day,Holidays-and-Traditions

appreciate art that already celebrates it here are a few ways to celebrate pi artistically write poetry write either a pi ku haiku or a regular pi em poem to show how much you love pi write a pi themed song and sing it or write a short pi themed skit and act it out paint a picture of pi watch movies related to pi try the film π it s an interesting and dark movie about a mathematician who goes

miles 5 05 km which is just a tiny bit longer than a 5k you can take this a step further by organizing a pi mile run with friends or colleagues lay down in pi formation and take a picture if you re

minute you can cheer wildly or even have a countdown leading up to pi minute the minute before for added effect for a countdown have a pi drop where you drop a big pie off a balcony or another elevated structure you can even add a lot of sprinkles to the pie to make it look like a disco ball if you ve written a pi song or made a pi dance this would be the perfect minute to share your art note that there is some debate regarding the exact time that pi day should be celebrated though 1 59pm is probably the most common some believe that the 24 hour clock should be used instead which would mean that pi day should be celebrated at 1 59am or 15 09pm convert things into pi this step is absolutely necessary for two reasons first to utterly confuse people who have no idea what you re talking about and secondly to have fun seeing how many things can be referenced with pi this will help you reach an even higher appreciation for the amazing number that is pi consider two approaches use pi to tell the time convert naturally circular things into radians like the hours on the clock instead of it being 3 o clock now it s 1 2 pi o clock or instead of it being 3 o clock convert the inclination of the sun into radians and describe that as the time simply use 3 14 as a unit of measure instead of being 31 years old you are 9pi years old with this same approach you can find out your next pi birthday just don t forget to celebrate it when it comes help the tradition continue don t let this be a one time thing you owe it to pi to celebrate again and again set the date for next year and consider creating a pi club or website in the process talk about your plans for pi day the following year this will help generate enthusiasm take notes after your pi day celebration what can you do next year to make your celebration even more incredible next year talk about the day months in advance so your skeptical friends can be convinced to join in you can even advertise for the event by emailing your closest friends or even setting up a pi day facebook page,Holidays-and-Traditions

how to celebrate hobbit day,september 22 is the birthday of the famous hobbits bilbo and frodo baggins in recognition of these endearing characters created by j r r tolkien this date has come to be known as hobbit day so that fans of hobbits everywhere can pause and celebrate the delight that is a hobbit so if you re one of those very people who wants to take one day this year to honor the fine race of hobbits here are some ideas to help you celebrate,plan a long expected party with fellow hobbit fans this refers to the chapter one of the fellowship of the ring in the book this party involves bilbo baggins birthday his departure and gandalf farewelling frodo baggins in your case it is just a great excuse to have a party some of the things to set the scene might include decorating with a pile of packages to represent the wagon that is laden with packages in the story as well as piles of presents fireworks or at least sparklers it s not likely you can recreate one in the image of a dragon but at least consider having a flag or a poster with a dragon on it lanterns for lighting would be reminiscent of the book have dancing music songs and games decide where to hold the party if you have a large tree in your backyard or in a nearby park consider making it the party tree an outdoor hobbit party is probably more in keeping with the tradition of big hobbit events than trying to cram everyone indoors but obviously this will depend on where you live and the weather the benefit of being outdoors is the juvenile hobbits can run around without feeling cooped up and all crumbs can be eaten by the creatures of the earth without the need to vacuum up if you decide to hold the party in a house put up pictures or decorations with a hobbit theme there are plenty of images that you can print out from online images to use in your private home environment and you can embellish these with computer photo programs if needed make sure that your festivities include a good amount of food either a large meal or various snack foods hobbits were known for their many well stocked pantries as was made known on the first page of the hobbit food that might be perfect for a hobbit celebration includes unsurprisingly much of it seems like traditional english fare mushrooms these are favorite hobbit food and farmer maggot used to grow them and frodo got caught trying to steal some wine bilbo and frodo both inherited vineyards beer is also popular with hobbits hot soup cold meats mince pies pork pies rabbit fish and chips rashers of bacon blackberry tarts and other blackberry foods including uncooked blackberries freshly baked bread and lots of butter pickles are often mentioned ripe cheese food made from vegetables such as corn turnips carrots potatoes and onions food made with apples such as apple tart with raspberry jam honey foods made with honey such as honey cakes would be nice scones known as biscuits in north america fruit pies and cakes including seed cakes pinwheel sandwiches just because these are small and cute and the hobbits may have approved provided they weren t too fussy tea and coffee keep seasonings and sauces to a minimum apparently hobbits didn t bother with them that much choose a passage or more about hobbits from one of tolkien s books to read aloud together this is important for both fans and non initiates alike the fans will know the passages and the non initiate will be introduced to the way of hobbits through listening ask someone with an excellent projecting voice who enjoys reading in public to read out the passages so it s enjoyable for everyone play games hobbits loved games so a party celebrating hobbits needs to have plenty of these going you could start by putting a hobbit name on each guest s back and making people figure out who they are just by asking questions of other guests no peeking other games to consider include and each of these can be made suitable for any age with an imagination backyard party games like quoits horseshoe tossing beanbag throwing sack jumping egg and spoon race three legged race coconut shy etc indoor games like musical chairs pass the parcel the chocolate game pin the tail on the donkey statues chinese whispers etc play rhyming games and making up haiku poems limericks etc play games that involve riddles charades sayings or proverbs have a special cake as well as all the other scrumptious food don t forget that hobbit day is also a birthday party for bilbo and frodo make or purchase a special birthday cake with two candles one for each hobbit for fun you might toast the bagginses and make little speeches in their honor give away lovely things to everyone who comes to the party small but creative gifts such as toys jewelry trinkets small musical instruments puzzles etc should be given to the guests this represents one of the peaceful pursuits of hobbits gift giving and is the spirit of sharing and creating community both valued by hobbits see how to make a birthday goodie bag for adults how to put together a goodie bag how to sew a cloth gift bag and how to make gift bags for more ideas if you do not think your friends would be very interested in a hobbit day celebration celebrate the day in your own way walk around barefoot for the day eat about six meals hobbits are always hungry or make a hobbit day t shirt to spread awareness consider making flyers to share with friends and acquaintances to help them understand the importance of this day,Holidays-and-Traditions

small risk and celebrate everything you ve already accomplished to make the most of this unique holiday,take a step back and reassess your major life goals march fourth is a great time to think about

couple years what big picture goals do you want to accomplish 2 x research source your big picture goals could be anything you want think about broad dreams or ambitions you have like moving to a new home making a career shift improving a relationship or getting serious about your health write down your big picture goals in clear focused language like this year i want to create my own blog or i want to move out by this time next year break those ambitious goals into smaller achievable stepping stones going after lofty big picture goals by themselves can be overwhelming and might scare you away from even starting instead break down your big ambitions into smaller less intimidating goals make these goals very specific and set a deadline for each one 3 x research source for example if your big goal is to run a marathon at the end of the year step 1 could be as small as finding a training plan step 2 could be to start by running just 15 minutes a day for 3 days a week and step 3 could be to increase by 5 minutes after the first 2 weeks each time you complete a smaller goal you ll have a double sense of accomplishment you ll hit a milestone and move yourself closer to your big dream figure out how to track your performance tracking your progress helps you stay motivated and on track to hit your deadlines finding a way to do this can be more difficult for some goals than others but the main objective is to be able to watch your progress as it happens be proud of yourself for staying on top of things and know when it s time to work a little harder 4 x research source for example if your goal is to write a novel you can track your progress by tracking your daily word count if you realize that your productivity is going down you ll be able to pinpoint when that started happening what caused it and how to fix it write down exactly how you intend to monitor your progress and hold yourself to that part of achieving your goal is keeping yourself focused and on track to hit every deadline remind yourself why these goals are important to you if you re serious about achieving your goals you probably have serious reasons for doing so clarify those reasons write them down and let them fuel you when your motivation starts to lag dipping into this sense of purpose and desire will help renew your drive 5 x research source for example if your goal is to find a new job your driving motivation might be to do something you re passionate about earn more money or take on more responsibility stay motivated by telling friends and family and planning rewards you re still in the planning stages of making your goals but you can use your march fourth motivation to plan for times when you might not be feeling so driven for each step of your goal set a small reward for yourself to include positive motivation 6 x research source you can also use peer pressure to keep yourself on track tell friends and family what you re doing and ask them to support you by checking in to see how your goal is coming along challenge yourself to do 1 2 small things that you wouldn t normally do you ll be amazed at what you can do when you train yourself to be ok with discomfort and march fourth is the perfect day to start today do 1 2 small activities that you d normally feel uncomfortable doing then challenge yourself to do the same thing the next day and the next 7 x research source for example if you re shy try saying having a short conversation with everyone you see today at work or school try a new kind of food for lunch or contributing a comment during class or a meeting even though these are just small actions they ll help you get used to being uncomfortable soon you ll feel less afraid to try bigger things that test your limits like asking for a raise or trying something physically challenging like skydiving visualize yourself succeeding and feeling great it s normal to feel nervous when you re stepping outside of your comfort zone to calm yourself take a few deep breaths and picture a positive outcome that could come from challenging yourself like this imagine how good you ll feel and allow that positivity to fill you up giving you the confidence to go for it 8 x research source try repeating an empowering phrase to yourself like i can do this i m safe or i ll be fine no matter what focus on what you ll learn from this experience instead of the discomfort you re not stepping outside of your comfort zone just to torture yourself you re doing it to learn and grow when you start to feel awkward nervous or uncomfortable just remember your end goal you re working to become brave and confident in yourself and that will be more than worth a few moments of discomfort 9 x research source for example you could step out of your comfort zone by having a difficult conversation face to face instead of via phone or texting focus on how this is making you a better more empathetic person and how you re learning to deal with other people s negative feelings imagine an alter ego of yourself if you re still feeling nervous if you still can t quite get over the hump and out of your comfort zone imagine an alternate version of yourself who is confident in this situation embody that part of your personality and inhabit it pretending that you re totally at ease and comfortable it might still feel strange at first but over time you ll get more comfortable and soon you won t even need that alter ego 10 x research source this strategy is similar to the phrase fake it till you make it if you re still scared at stepping out of your comfort zone pretend that you re not and do it anyways keep doing this and you ll eventually realize that you re not faking it at all that you really are that brave and confident remind yourself of the benefits of leaving your comfort zone people often say that the best things in your life lay right outside your comfort zone to get to a place you ve never been you have to do something that you ve never done before and chances are that ll feel uncomfortable be ok with discomfort and challenge yourself to embrace the fear see what you re really capable of and how far you can go when you don t hold yourself back 11 x research source remember that no matter what the outcome is taking a risk will help you grow mistakes become experiences you can reflect upon and learn from in the future set aside time to celebrate in whatever way you want march fourth isn t just about challenging yourself and setting new goals it s also about appreciating yourself for the things you ve already accomplished give yourself some time at the end of the day to celebrate what you ve done this year in whatever way feels most special to you rewarding yourself like this will refresh your energy and motivate you to seek new challenges 12 x research source if you don t think you have anything to celebrate look again it could be something as small as cooking a new meal last week or doing something you d been putting off everyone has something exciting waiting to be appreciated you could throw a party with friends treat yourself to a nice dinner or simply spend time relaxing with a book or your favorite show do whatever makes you feel the most appreciated acknowledge and thank anyone who helped you along the way chances are you wouldn t have been able to accomplish what you did without some help along the way invite over the people who helped you for a joint celebration give them a call to thank them or simply send a heartfelt text let them know that you appreciate their help and couldn t have done it without them 13 x research source share your accomplishments with your friends and family sharing what you ve done with the people you love can make you feel even more appreciated and might even inspire them to go after their own goals don t brag simply share your accomplishment in a positive excited way and let their pride in your lift you up even more 14 x research source for example you could say something like remember how i was trying to design that website for the business well i finally finished it wanna take a look i think it turned out really well reflect on what you ve done and learned you can take something away from everything you ve tried achieved or even failed at ask yourself what you ve learned about yourself from this accomplishment no matter how small it might be how do you feel now that you re done how can you use what you ve learned moving forward 15 x research source for example if you re celebrating going to the gym for the first time in a while think about what it was that finally motivated you to go and how you felt when you were there and afterwards you can use the same motivational tactics to get you to the gym the next time and build off of your experiences to feel more confident there re energize yourself and get ready to take on your next goal perhaps the most important part of celebrating a goal is to motivate you to go after the next one giving yourself time to relax and feel proud serves as a much needed break while reminding you that there s a reward waiting at the end of each milestone 16 x research source,Holidays-and-Traditions

repeated annually for example pull out photographs taken the first time you brought your child home and narrate the events of the adoption to your child in a loving and affirming way 5 x research

manner put together a family scrapbook or journal this will help the child feel that they belong in the family and communicate that gotcha day is a celebration of family and the adopted child s place in that family you can cut up photographs from the past year and tape them to a page or two in a scrapbook for the child to flip through and remember fun times had as part of your family 6 x research source you could also keep a family journal and each gotcha day write in it a few favorite family memories from the previous year these could include memories from vacations and travel and have space for the child to write or draw their thoughts on the adoptive process this method is a useful alternative to a more typical birthday party approach to celebrating gotcha day a scrapbook or family journal places the focus on family connection and intimacy celebrate the child s birth heritage and culture if you adopted the child from a culture heritage or racial background different from your own it s important to affirm this heritage to your child use gotcha day as an opportunity to familiarize your child with their heritage and celebrate their cultural origin 7 x research source for example if you ve adopted an african american child take him or her to an african american cultural or art museum on gotcha day especially as your adopted child ages this will help them feel that they are fully a member of your family but that they do not have to assimilate or sacrifice their cultural background to belong in the adoptive family celebrate national adoption day if you feel that a celebration of gotcha day will cause your adopted child emotional distress or is insensitive in general focus your celebration instead on national adoption day this informal holiday is typically celebrated on the saturday before thanksgiving 8 x research source a celebration of national adoption day can focus on the good work being done by adoption agencies in general rather than celebrating your particular case of having adopted a child your celebration could include a fun party for all of the adopted children in your neighborhood or community this will allow the adopted children to form friendships and uncover shared experiences and realize that they are not alone in their adoption experiences 9 x research source a celebration of national adoption day can also help reduce any lingering stigma around the concept of adoption 10 x research source respect your child s ambiguous feelings while the adoption process is often one of triumph and success for parents culminating in bringing home the adopted child for the child itself the process can be much more emotionally complex adoption tears children from the life they ve known until that point and a celebration of gotcha day may primarily remind children of being taken from their family and former life 11 x research source if your child has primarily negative feelings associated with the adoptive process consider forgoing a gotcha day celebration altogether use a different name to avoid the word gotcha many adoptive parents and their adopted children feel that the word gotcha is problematic and inappropriately casual gotcha implies that the adopted child was snatched from their original home or taken in like a prize it also focuses on the happiness of the parents and their successful obtaining of a child and can even have the effect of making the child him or herself feel left out of the celebration 12 x research source to remedy this some families have changed the name to family day adoption day or family anniversary day keep the focus on the child and the family gotcha day and adoption celebrations in general can have an unfortunate tendency to focus on the parents and can over emphasize the sacrifices parents have made to bring adopted children home to remedy this rather than focusing on the parents focus on the unified family and the special place held by the adopted child 13 x research source if your child is old enough ask them if they re comfortable with celebrating gotcha day it could be the case the celebration only reminds the child of being taken from their birth parents make sure that your child feels comfortable with whatever level of celebration you choose to have or forego a celebration altogether,Holidays-and-Traditions

how to bury st joseph,burying a statue of st joseph is a traditional and popular practice people often resort to when trying to sell a house the exact placement of the statue can vary depending on who you ask but there is still a general procedure you should follow,buy a statue of saint joseph choose a small simple statue so that the burial will be easier to perform you can by saint statues at catholic supply stores and online the ideal height is between 3 and 4 inches 7 6 and 10 cm nowadays you can even buy a st joseph home selling kit from retailers and some real estate offices these kits usually come with a small statue of st joseph a prayer card and instructions on the practice wrap the statue in protective cloth take a soft clean washcloth or similar material and wrap it around the statue several time covering all sides including the top and bottom consider placing the wrapped statue in a resealable plastic bag as well you could also wrap the statue in plastic wrap or place it directly in the plastic bag without first wrapping it in a cloth the idea is simply to protect it from as much dirt and damage as possible wrapping the statue is a matter of practicality but more importantly it is also a sign of respect even though you are burying his statue st joseph is still a saint so you should demonstrate a certain degree of respect for his likeness bury the statue dig a hole in your yard that is deep enough to fit the entire statue place the wrapped statue inside then fill the rest of the hole in with dirt note that any specifics concerning the exact placement of the statue vary depending on who you ask so there is no one definitive choice the most common tradition holds that you should bury the statue near the for sale sign or near the road place the statue inside the hole upside down and facing your house others insist that the statue should face the road to symbolize the act of leaving the home some traditions also suggest placing the statue right side up or lying on its back pointing toward the house like an arrow 1 x research source you could also consider placing the statue 3 feet 1 m away from the rear of the house or in your rear yard flower bed consider burying the statue in a flower pot if you live in an apartment or a condominium you may not have a yard that you can bury the statue in under these circumstances you should bury the statue in a large flower pot place the flower pot on a deck patio or windowsill the flower pot can have something growing in it but this is not a strict necessity note that the rest of the tradition stays the same you should still wrap the statue in protective cloth and treat it with the same degree of reverence consider keeping the statue in your home if the thought of burying a statue of st joseph seems disrespectful to you consider placing the statue in your home instead set the statue down in a window or on a counter in clear sight of the for sale sign in your yard when doing this you do not need to wrap the statue in protective cloth burying the statue is a matter of tradition not doctrine there is no catholic doctrine stating that burying a statue of st joseph will help you sell your house church teachings do suggest that calling for st joseph s intercession when selling your home can help though which is why keeping a statue of st joseph in your home during the sale would likely work just as well as burying the statue pray upon burial as soon as you bury the statue you should say a prayer to st joseph asking for his intercession the exact prayer can vary and you can go with a pre written prayer or a prayer from your own heart some prayers threaten st joseph essentially stating that he should sell your home for you if he wants to get out of the ground these prayers somewhat undermine the value of asking for intercession however so they are generally not preferred consider using a simple humble prayer like the following o blessed st joseph tenderhearted father faithful guardian of jesus chaste spouse of the mother of god i pray you to join with me in praising god the father through his divine son who died on the cross and rose again to give us sinners new life through the holy name of jesus pray that we may obtain from the eternal father the favor we ask for our home sale we have been unfaithful to the unfailing love of god the father beg of jesus mercy for us his brothers and sisters amid the splendors of god s loving presence do not forget the sorrows of whose who weep by your prayers and those of your most holy spouse our blessed lady may the love of jesus answer our call of confident hope amen say a prayer each day until the house sells while saying a single prayer at the time of burial is good repeating a prayer for intercession each day from that point on demonstrates a greater degree of faith and earnestness you can say the same prayer each day or offer a different one try a nine day novena instead of saying a standard prayer each day you could try saying a novena a novena is a set of prayers recited over the course of nine days there are different variations but essentially you say a different prayer each day and follow each prayer with an our father consider using the following novena 2 x research source day one o god guide of those who listen and helper of those who hear your voice speak to me as you did to st joseph and help me accomplish the things you give me to do day two o god you love your people and bless the ordinary lives we quietly live as you blessed st joseph bless what i do however hidden and simple it may be and let all i do be done with love day three o god ever faithful you remember us always and in time reveal your blessings help me trust in you as st joseph faithfully trusted and never let me lose faith in the wonderful gifts you promise me day four god of families bless the family that s mine keep us safe from harm and never let evil come between us let peace remain in our hearts day five o god who loves children be kind to our children today give them eyes of faith for seeing far a loving heart for welcoming life and a place always at your side day six god of our heavenly home bless our home on earth let the spirit of mary and joseph rest at our table shape our words and actions and bring blessing to our children day seven god our father give your fatherly spirit to those who are fathers now like joseph give them hearts of devoted love for their wives and children and strength for forgiveness and patience day eight give shelter o god to those who need it and bring together families divided give us enough to eat and decent work to earn our bread care for us o god day 9 bless all families o lord especially those in need remembering the life of your son we pray for the poor for those who lack a good home for those in exile grant them a protector like joseph o god dig up the statue when your house sells as soon as the contract is signed and the final details are in order remove the statue from its place in your yard unwrap the protective cloth and wash away any dirt that managed to get on the statue itself according to legend if you leave the statue in the yard the new owners of the house will not be able to stay there for a long time new owners will come and go until the statue is finally removed while there may not be any proof to back this legend removing the statue should at least be done as a sign of respect give thanks offer a prayer of thanks first to god and then to st joseph for his intercession you can offer a prayer from your heart and in your own words or you could say a generic pre written prayer of thanks either way the important thing is to pray with sincerity an example prayer of thanks would be heavenly father i thank you for my life and everything you have bestowed upon me and upon all people this day and every day i thank you for the good and bad the understanding of forgiveness and your holy power without which we would have nothing i thank you this day for all your blessings your gifts your never ending love for us although we all are sinners i ask you to forgive me every day for what i might have done wrong that i might not have noticed even though we all come short of the glory of god i thank you for the sacrifice of your only son jesus christ for all our sins you and only you know us father and you know if our hearts are true so once again i thank you with all my heart and soul in the name of christ i pray amen 3 x research source display the statue in a place of honor in your new home since intercession to st joseph helped you sell your home it is customary to display the statue you buried in your new home doing so demonstrates gratitude and reverence the display does not need to be anything fancy simply sitting the statue on your mantel or desk will suffice,Holidays-and-Traditions

how to determine when easter is,easter is not celebrated on a fixed date and can fall anywhere between march 22 and april 25 to determine when easter is in any given year you ll need to pay attention to the lunar cycle and the date of the march equinox,mark the vernal equinox the date easter falls on is based on the ecclesiastical approximation of the vernal spring equinox this approximation falls on the same date each year march 21 note that this calculation relies on the ecclesiastical estimation of the vernal equinox not the actual vernal equinox identified by the astronomical system of measurement the actual moment of equinox can shift within 24 hours and may arrive a day before march 21 this is not taken into consideration when the date of easter is determined however this is the vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere only for those in the southern hemisphere it is the autumnal equinox the same date march 21 is used in both hemispheres though find the date of the first full moon identify the date of the first full moon that comes after the vernal equinox this date will land no later than a month after the vernal equinox you can find out this information by checking a lunar calendar these calendars track and illustrate the day by day phases of the moon you can buy a lunar wall or desk calendar or you can search for a free one online skip ahead to the following sunday the sunday after the first moon following the vernal equinox is the date that easter falls on 1 x research source for example the first full moon after the vernal equinox in 2014 came on tuesday april 15 2 x research source this means that in 2014 easter fell on the following sunday april 20 note whether or not the full moon falls on sunday if the first full moon after the vernal equinox lands on a sunday the date of easter is delayed by one week and lands on the following sunday this delay is put into place to decrease the risk of easter sunday landing on the same day as the jewish passover for instance the first full moon after the vernal equinox in 1994 fell on sunday march 27 3 x research source instead of easter also falling on march 27 it fell a week later on sunday april 3 back up one week to find palm sunday palm sunday is exactly one week before easter palm sunday celebrates christ s entry into jerusalem it also marks the beginning of holy week pay special attention to the week in between palm sunday and easter the entire week is often referred to as holy week but the thursday friday and saturday immediately before easter in particular are recognized as dates of significance in the christian calendar maundy thursday celebrates the last supper of christ it also recognizes the washing of feet a biblical event during which jesus washed the feet of his apostles many christian denominations celebrate the maundy washing of feet as a church ordinance good friday recognizes the day that christ was crucified holy saturday commemorates the time during which christ s body lay in the tomb it is typically viewed as a day of preparation for easter sunday count back to the wednesday six weeks before easter trace back to the sunday that came six calendar weeks earlier the wednesday immediately before that date is ash wednesday in other words ash wednesday is 46 days before easter each year ash wednesday is a formal day of repentance in many christian churches it also marks the first day of lent a period of 40 days over which christians are to spiritually prepare for easter count 40 days ahead ascension day is a christian holiday that falls exactly 39 days after easter sunday 4 x research source ascension day celebrates christ s ascension into heaven in some christian denominations it is also considered the fortieth day of easter meaning that all the days in between easter sunday and ascension day are part of the broader easter season understand the history easter has always been celebrated near the date of the jewish passover but the exact method of determining the date on which to celebrate easter has changed slightly over the centuries easter is a celebration of christ s return from the dead after his crucifixion in the bible jesus rose from the dead on the first sunday following the jewish passover passover begins on the fifteenth day of the month of nisan in the hebrew calendar this roughly corresponds to the first full moon after the march equinox but the hebrew calendar is not based on the cycles of the moon so the timing is not exact since the date of passover needed to be announced each year by jewish officials early christian leaders simplified the date of easter by scheduling it consistently for the sunday after the full moon this happened in 325 ce and was an official declaration of the council of nicaea 5 x research source the practice of using the moon and equinox as a dating system actually has ties to pagan practices though religious dates were never previously established using astronomical events in the jewish tradition from which most of christian tradition arose the practice of doing so was pagan in nature but early christians adopted it for the sake of simplifying their own dating system note the difference between gregorian and julian calendars most western churches roman catholics and most protestants follow the standard calendar also known as the gregorian calendar some orthodox christian churches still use the julian calendar to determine the date of easter the gregorian calendar was created when scientists discovered that the julian calendar was too long the dates of both calendars are similar but slightly different the gregorian calendar is more accurately aligned to the equinox remember the time frame according to either calendar easter will always fall between march 22 and april 25 this time frame does not occur over the same set of days for both calendars though if you are observing the gregorian calendar like most do the easter time frame in the julian calendar would actually run from april 3 to may 10 watch for possible reforms to the date several churches and nations have proposed various reforms to the manner in which the date of easter is determined but so far none of these reforms have been put into practice in 1997 the world council of churches discussed the possibility of replacing the current system of calculation with an equation based method of calculation that depended more directly on astronomical events this reform was scheduled for 2001 but was never actually adopted in 1928 the united kingdom actually fixed the date of easter as the first sunday after the second saturday in april but the act putting it into law was never actually implemented and the reform was never followed,Holidays-and-Traditions

meaning of christmas then consider some ways to improve the season s message together learn how to understand the true meaning of christmas,research the meaning of christmas yourself or with your family you may decide to use different methods if you are encouraging your toddlers or parents to participate in learning than if you would do it for yourself go to the library and find books about the history of christmas if you are a book lover or researcher then this may give you the background needed to begin your understanding of christmas consider the following research topics when looking into christmas origins when was jesus christ born most scholars both biblical and otherwise agree that jesus was not born on december 25th rather this date was chosen because the church could use overcome and deemphasize 1 x research source the winter solstice celebrations that were commonly celebrated at the time the roman catholic church is reported to have chosen this date in the 4th century read about the story of the nativity many books in addition to the bible are written specifically on this subject they can shed light on the customs and traditions associated with the story of the nativity study the intersection of christian stories and pagan celebrations the winter solstice included many celebrations to pagan gods the customs of the roman festival of saturnalia may be the common origin of giving presents the druids brought home mistletoe decorations st nicholas saint nick santa claus was a bishop and cardinal who was said to give secret gifts and is celebrated in the netherlands and other countries as the patron saint of children avoid confusing children with expecting to receive gifts and enjoying the christmas lights as if those carry the meaning of christmas our constitutional freedoms may not always continue but our freedom in christ including our freedom as we suffer for christ can fear the situation where you re relying upon civic and government institutions to protect the christian rights they will not unless they want to the job of the church is to get the christian story right which is comprised of christ alive god incarnate in the flesh plus transformed believing individuals separate the pagan traditions from the christian traditions you can create a fun game to play with your family which explains common christmas traditions and whether they are associated with pagan events or contain christian messages jesus said whatever you do to or for the least of my children you do to me purchase a nativity set many cultures have a rich tradition of collecting figures for the nativity this is an especially good way to embrace christmas with children because you can study each figure and what it represents in italy the nativity scene or presepio changes throughout the holiday season they are set up on december 8th and taken down on the epiphany on january 6th the baby jesus appears in the nativity on december 25th and the wise men

the christian faith to reap meaning from the christmas season learn about the other traditions and their deeper messages volunteer your time to a charity so much focus is put on presents that you can easily lose the true meaning of giving specifically of yourself and your time rather than money studies have shown that people who volunteer or give to charity during the holidays are happier and more positive so perhaps the act of doing something will shed more light on the phrase goodwill toward men encourage your children to give time or goods to a charity many local charities pick up old toys winter coats and more to give to children who are in need ask them to choose some things to share with someone who may need it more make a list of things you need to do for christmas make note of a lack of traditions or time spent with family revise your schedule so that you do something that brings your family closer together every few days whether it is caroling driving to look at christmas lights baking together or volunteering make new traditions based on your own family and friends decide if the regular traditions such as giving presents or watching a popular christmas movie are your favorite heart warming experiences or if you do them just because they are easy creating your own recipes for traditions will give deeper meanings to your holiday season be thankful just as you are at thanksgiving ask your family to make lists of what they love about christmas other than the material goods read them aloud to give everyone a chance to express their own thankfulness and significance make sure the experiences outweigh the material goods in your holiday schedule if your schedule is focused on quality time spent with people you are more likely to feel a deep connection to the holidays than whether you are short on money and gift ideas if your family is too involved in materialism at christmas suggest a change of gift giving tradition when money is short psychologists believe that experiences create a more lasting feeling of happiness than buying material goods instead of buying each other presents decide to put holiday money toward a vacation visit back home or weekend adventure or caroling from door to door and such the memories are likely to live longer than the shelf life of most goods,Holidays-and-Traditions

into christmas origins when was jesus christ born most scholars both biblical and otherwise agree that jesus was not born on december 25th rather this date was chosen because the church could use overcome and deemphasize 1 x research source the winter solstice celebrations that were commonly celebrated at the time the roman catholic church is reported to have chosen this date in the 4th century read about the story of the nativity many books in addition to the bible are written specifically on this subject they can shed light on the customs and traditions associated with the story of the nativity study the intersection of christian stories and pagan celebrations the winter solstice included many celebrations to pagan gods the customs of the roman festival of saturnalia may be the common origin of giving presents the druids brought home mistletoe decorations st nicholas saint nick santa claus was a bishop and cardinal who was said to give secret gifts and is celebrated in the

whether they are associated with pagan events or contain christian messages jesus said whatever you do to or for the least of my children you do to me purchase a nativity set many cultures have a rich tradition of collecting figures for the nativity this is an especially good way to embrace christmas with children because you can study each figure and what it represents in italy the nativity scene or presepio changes throughout the holiday season they are set up on december 8th and taken down on the epiphany on january 6th the baby jesus appears in the nativity on december 25th and the wise men

winter coats and more to give to children who are in need ask them to choose some things to share with someone who may need it more make a list of things you need to do for christmas make note of a lack of traditions or time spent with family revise your schedule so that you do something that brings your family closer together every few days whether it is caroling driving to look at christmas lights baking together or volunteering make new traditions based on your own family and friends decide if the regular traditions such as giving presents or watching a popular christmas movie are your favorite heart warming experiences or if you do them just because they are easy creating your own recipes for traditions will give deeper meanings to your holiday season be thankful just as you are at thanksgiving ask your family to make lists of what they love about christmas other than the material goods read them aloud to give everyone a chance to express their own thankfulness and significance make sure the experiences outweigh the material goods in your holiday schedule if your schedule is focused on quality time spent with people you are more likely to feel a deep connection to the holidays than whether you are short on money and gift ideas if your family is too involved in materialism at christmas suggest a change of gift giving tradition when money is short psychologists believe that experiences create a more lasting feeling of happiness than buying material goods instead of buying each other presents decide to put holiday money toward a vacation visit back home or

how to make elf ears,if you are planning on dressing up as an elf for the holidays or for a character costume then you need a pair of pointy elf ears to complete it there are multiple ways to create a pair of elf ears for varying crafting skill sets you can make the ears out of felt and attach them to a headband or shape your ear with tape for a quick project or you can do a more involved project and make a custom elf ear prosthetic out of liquid latex and modeling clay to get started choose a method that works well for your crafting skill set and time,hold a piece of paper over your ear and trace the general shape with a pencil while looking in a mirror hold a piece of paper against your ear with your free hand lightly outline the general shape of your ear onto the paper don t worry about the sketch being perfect as you will just be using it as a guide for sizing your template 1 x research source ask a friend or family member to help you trace the shape of your ear to make the process easier draw an elf ear around the outline of your ear and cut it out use a pencil and a piece of paper to sketch the general shape that you want your elf ears to be the key is to create a pointy almost triangular point on the top of the ear make the points of the ears long and tapered or short and stout then use scissors to carefully cut out the elf ear so you can use it as a template 2 x research source alternatively conduct a general image search online for an elf ear template and then print one that matches the style and shape you have in mind just make sure to size the width and length of the image to the outline of your ear otherwise it may not cover your ear trace the template onto a piece of felt 4 times and cut them out choose a felt color that is close to your skin tone lay your template along the edge of one side of the piece of felt to reduce waste and trace it with a pencil or fabric marker lift the template and move it to the next section of felt and repeat the process 3 more times then carefully cut out the 4 shapes these will be the layers for the elf ears 3 x research source be careful not to create a thick line if you are using a fabric marker as it might bleed through the felt you can purchase felt at a local craft store or online with major retailers instead of felt you can also use colored construction paper or even a thin piece of crafting foam both of which can be purchased at a local craft store or online with major retailers if you are unable to find a material that is close to your skin tone consider tracing the shape onto a plain white piece of paper and using colored pencils or crayons to color it to match your skin tone secure 2 of the felt cutouts together by piping hot glue around the edges outline 1 of the felt cutouts with hot glue then rest a second felt cutout on top of the first line up the shape and edges of the 2 felt cutouts and then press down to secure allow the hot glue to dry for 1 2 minutes the layered felt will make the ears more sturdy 4 x research source repeat this process for the other 2 felt pieces just make sure to layer the pieces so you wind up with a left and a right ear if the elf ear shapes are not symmetrical to make the ears bendy lay small pieces of thin jewelry wire along the edge of the ear before piping on the hot glue when assembled you will be able to bend the wire within the ear to shape it alternatively leave the bottom edge unglued and open if you want to slip the felt ears over your own ears use hot glue to attach the ears to a festive hat or a simple headband to wear make sure the ears are evenly positioned on the sides of the hat or headband and then place a dab of glue on each spot press the ears to the blobs of hot glue and allow it to dry for 1 2 minutes before wearing it 5 x research source clip or tie back any hair around your ears to keep it from sticking to the tape while looking a mirror use hair clips or hair ties to move and secure your hair away from both of your ears you will be applying tape to your ears so you don t want strands of your hair to stick to the adhesive 6 x research source if you have short hair consider putting on a skullcap to protect the short pieces of hair around your ears place a piece of tape that is 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm across the top of your ear use either clear or masking tape to do this begin by placing the tape at the cross section where the top of your ear attaches to the side of your head bring the piece of tape horizontally across the front of your ear from that point and secure it just slightly behind your ear tear away excess tape as needed 7 x research source be careful not to bend or contort the shape of your ear to avoid cutting off the blood flow through your ear refrain from using tape that is wide and has a strong adhesive like packaging tape as this will be difficult to apply and will be hard to remove similarly avoid using painter s tape to do this as the adhesive may not withstand the oils produced by your skin add 4 5 more tape layers moving each piece higher to form a point place additional layers of tape each a little higher than the last across the top of your ear after few layers the tape will look like mummy wrappings across your ear once the layers start cresting beyond your ear a bit pinch the excess tape to form a point 8 x research source continue building layers of tape until the top of your ear is concealed and you are satisfied with the shape of the point repeat this taping process for your other ear try to shape the point of the ear similar to the first one you created apply concealer and eyeshadow to the tape so it matches your skin tone use a makeup sponge a small paintbrush or even your finger to coat the tape with a shade of concealer that closely matches your skin tone dab the product on until all of the tape is evenly coated allow the concealer to set and then soften the look of the concealer by dusting on an eyeshadow that is a similar color 9 x research source repeat this concealing process for your other taped ear put some of the concealer and eyeshadow over the skin on your ear to blend of the edges of the tape if needed instead of concealer you can also use a liquid foundation that matches your skin tone unclip your hair or remove your skullcap and enjoy the look of your elf ears arrange your hair as you normally would if you have long hair leave a piece of hair in front of your ear and tuck the rest behind your ear this will help show off your elf ears better 10 x research source when you are finished wearing your elf ears simply clip back your hair to get it out of the way if needed and then slowly pull the tape off and discard it form a triangle out of modeling clay that is the width of the top of your ear make the triangle about 1 4 inch 0 64 cm thick look into a mirror and hold the triangle up to your ear as you are shaping it the width of the triangle should conceal the uppermost part of your ear leaving the top point of the triangle to rest above your ear continue molding the clay until you reach a desired shape and size 11 x research source make the triangle equilateral for a subtly pointed ear or create an elongated triangle for a more dramatic elf ear if you make your triangle too thick then your finished mold will be too large for your ear similarly if you make the triangle too thin it might snap when you go to remove your mold you can purchase modeling clay at your local craft or department store or online with major retailers outline the curved shape of the top of your ear into your clay triangle while looking in a mirror hold the triangle up to your ear use the eraser end of a wooden pencil to outline the shape of the top of your ear into the clay like a stencil the point on the triangle will almost act as the point of the elf ear resting on your curved stenciled line do not press so hard on the clay that you misshape or break the triangle just apply enough pressure to create a visible outline on the clay 12 x research source this outline will be the boundary for where you apply the liquid latex to create the elf ear prosthetics repeat this process for the other side of the triangle making sure that the shape of the traced lines match dip the eraser on your pencil into some liquid latex to coat it pour approximately 1 4 cup 59 ml of liquid latex into a disposable plastic bowl stir it with the eraser on your wooden pencil if needed then simply coat the eraser with the liquid latex 13 x research source you can purchase liquid latex at a local craft store or online with major retailers dab the coated eraser onto the clay working on the outside of the traced area use the eraser on your wooden pencil to apply the liquid latex to the clay triangle only apply the latex to the outside of the outline you traced onto the triangle smooth out the liquid latex with the eraser as you apply it to remove any visible bubbles or lumps continue to coat the clay triangle until all sides of the area outside of the outline are covered 14 x research source this will create a base coat of liquid latex for your elf ear you can use a small brush to apply the liquid latex but the brush will be ruined after doing so let the liquid latex air dry for 1 2 minutes before applying additional coats hold the clay triangle upside down for 1 2 minutes so the base coat of liquid latex can dry holding the triangle upside down will force any excess latex to run to the point of the ear and create a more realistic look 15 x research source alternatively speed up the process by blow drying the coat of liquid latex use the low speed on the cool setting and hold the hair dryer at least 6 in 15 cm away from the latex otherwise the air pressure will put ripples into your prosthetic ear apply approximately 9 more layers of liquid latex to your clay triangle use the same technique application and drying techniques to apply the additional layers make sure to take the allotted time needed to dry each layer before applying the next one 16 x research source dust the dried latex with cosmetic powder before pulling it off the clay use a small paintbrush to coat the dried liquid latex with the cosmetic powder this will prevent the latex from sticking to itself when you remove it 17 x research source use a cosmetic powder like a high definition powder lift the edges of the prosthetic and gently pull it off the clay roll back the edges of the prosthetic away from the clay carefully slide your finger between the latex and the clay with your free hand pull down on the clay triangle to remove it 18 x research source if desired dust the inside of the prosthetic with more powder to keep it from sealing itself closed reuse the clay triangle to make a second prosthetic for your other ear administer the same process for applying layering and drying the liquid latex to the clay triangle once all 10 layers are dry use your powder to coat the prosthetic before removing it from the clay triangle 19 x research source when you are done you will have 2 elf ear prosthetics coat the inside of the prosthetic with liquid latex and put it on your ear use the eraser on your wooden pencil to apply a thin coat of liquid latex to the inside of your prosthetic while looking in the mirror slide the prosthetic onto the top of your ear hold it in place for 1 2 minutes while the liquid latex dries 20 x research source make sure to pin back any hair by your ear to keep it from sticking to the liquid latex as it dries apply liquid latex around the edges of the attached prosthetic to seal them use the eraser from your pencil to apply the liquid latex smooth the liquid latex around the edges of the prosthetic to create a seamless transition between your ear and the prosthetic continue this process until the edges are sealed and allow it to dry for another 1 2 minutes 21 x research source be careful not to get any of the liquid latex in your hair while doing this repeat this application process for the second prosthetic apply concealer and eyeshadow to the prosthetic so it matches your skin use a small paintbrush to apply a thin coat of concealer to the prosthetic make sure to pick a color of concealer that matches your skin tone allow the concealer to dry and then powder it with a similar color of eyeshadow to soften the look of the concealer 22 x research source repeat this concealing process for the second prosthetic then enjoy the look of your custom latex elf ears use soap and warm water to gently remove the latex prosthetic if you are careful enough you may even be able to reuse your prosthetic in the future,Holidays-and-Traditions

how to hang heavy ornaments on a real tree,decorating a tree during the holidays is a nostalgic and fun activity that helps usher in the season for many people twinkly lights colorful garland special ornaments there s really no wrong way to trim your tree but sometimes heavier ornaments can cause branches to bend and mar the look of your otherwise spectacular tree try heading off this problem by picking a real tree with sturdier thicker branches to help support the weight of heavier ornaments and take your time decorating to find the right placement for each one,hang the lights garland and tinsel first so they won t get in the way it would be much harder and more precarious to add lighting and other stringed elements to the tree after the heavier ornaments were in place trim the tree however you prefer with those basic decorations before moving on to the actual ornaments 1 x research source a good rule of thumb to follow is that for each foot of the tree you should use 100 lights of course you can adjust that amount to cater to your lighting preferences replace worn wires or ribbons so the ornaments will be more secure heavier ornaments put more weight on their wires and ribbons and are more likely to come apart double check that the hanging apparatus is secure at the base of the ornament and that any ties are tightly done 2 x research source if you need to replace anything you can buy ornament wires and different sizes of ribbon from most craft stores or online weave heavier ornaments to the branches with dark green pipe cleaners if you put an ornament on the tree only to find that it s causing the branch to sag consider using a pipe cleaner to more evenly distribute its weight position the wire or ribbon so it s hanging from the middle of the pipe cleaner put the ornament where you want it on the tree and then wind either end of the pipe cleaner around the branch 4 5 times 3 x research source make sure to use dark green pipe cleaners so they blend in with the tree more naturally florist wire would work similarly to pipe cleaners you could also use zip ties just make sure to use black ones or green if you can find them you ll also want to trim away the end of the tie so that it isn t visible place the heaviest ornaments on the lower branches for extra support hang the smaller lighter ornaments at the top of the tree then use progressively bigger and heavier ornaments as you go down so the heaviest ones end up on the thickest bottom branches 4 x research source this also creates a nice visual effect where the smaller ornaments are paired with the thinner part of the tree and the bigger ones with the wider bottom hang heavy ornaments higher on the tree by putting them close to the trunk the closer to the tree trunk the sturdier the branches will be to space out heavy ornaments throughout the entire tree instead of just on the bottom branches put them far back in the tree so they have more support 5 x research source depending on how full the tree is the branches below the ornaments may provide some extra support to hold it up too reposition ornaments that bend branches to sturdier thicker ones once your ornaments are in place take a few steps back and look at your tree from all different angles pay close attention to those heavy ornaments if you notice a branch is sagging underneath the weight of the ornament move it so it s not at risk of falling off 6 x research source if you re worried about ornaments falling off the tree and breaking try using a thick skirt around the base of the tree to pad any potential falls if the branches aren t strong enough to hold the ornaments try putting them in a decorative bowl and using it as a holiday centerpiece choose the fraser fir for a sturdy tree that boasts a dark blue green color this tree also has that wonderful pine scent that reminds you of the holiday season making it an overall great pick for your christmas tree it has a pyramidal shape with well spaced branches meaning that your bigger heavier ornaments will have plenty of space to spread out 7 x research source keep this tree well watered so its soft needles don t fall off soon after it has been cut opt for the drought resistant scotch pine for a strong true green tree the last thing you want is a tree that will lose all its needles if you can t water it while you re out of town visiting relatives plus its branches are strong meaning they can support all sizes and weights of ornaments 8 x research source the needles of a scotch pine can be extremely sharp so be careful while you re decorating the tree you may also want to take a few minutes to vacuum up any needles that come loose while you were decorating so they don t accidentally get stuck in the bottom of someone s foot pick the colorado blue spruce for a hardy eco friendly tree if you re looking for something different from the traditional green of most christmas trees the colorado blue spruce may delight you with its blue white shades after the holiday season you can replant the tree outdoors it has very strong branches making it a great pick if you want to hang heavy ornaments 9 x research source be careful to not crush too many needles while you re decorating they have a slightly unpleasant smell avoid the douglas and balsam firs as they won t support heavy ornaments the douglas fir has very dense branches which can make it hard to squeeze in those heavier decorations the balsam fir s thin flexible branches make it an impractical choice 10 x research source if you want to get one of these trees consider hanging your heavy ornaments from somewhere else like a doorway or use them on a mantel or somewhere similar as decoration,Holidays-and-Traditions

announce the result only to find out that the venue is no longer free invite the guests with the venue secured it s time to announce it to the team either send a save the date email and follow up with formal invitations a month or so before the party when you have all the details or if you ve got all the information you need there is no time like the present to get those invites out don t forget to let people know if their partners are invited or not it will save you a lot of questions later on pick the theme if you are joining a shared party then you can skip this step because it will have been decided on for you the same goes exclusive parties but don t worry these events can still be spectacular think themes like under the sea or candy store if you are picking the theme yourself or together with an event planner then it s time to have a little fun your imagination is the limit but here are some ideas to get the juices flowing winter wonderland fire ice red white colour me bright masquerade ball any of the decades movie night once you ve picked your theme write a list of all the decorations and props that you will need and get ready for a mammoth shopping trip pick the food options 2 3 months before the event you should start thinking about catering now if you are attending a shared party or exclusive party then you won t have much to do at all except maybe circulate menu options and collate responses if on the other hand you are planning the event yourself then you have a bit of a task ahead of you the first thing you should do is find out if there are any special requirements for food are there vegetarians vegans allergy sufferers etc in attendance if so make sure that you have options for them too if you decide to hire caterers then your job will be a little easier they can present menu choice to you and you just have to pick what you want to go with if you re doing it all yourself then you need to start writing lists of the food you want to serve buffet style will be the easiest option drawing up shopping lists of what you ll need and seeing if you can rope in some helpers to prepare it all once you have your list it is probably easiest to order online and have it delivered directly to your venue supermarkets are great for this and often have offers on to help you save pennies decide on the beverages again if you re attending a shared or exclusive event then this will most likely be included in your package but if not you need to start working out how much you need and where you re going to get it from a general rule of thumb is to allow 2 drinks per guest for the first hour of the party and then one drink per hour after that if you re providing table wine then it is generally considered correct to allow 2 glasses half a bottle per person don t worry about catering for all tastes it s ok to pick just a few different alcoholic drinks people are generally less fussy about what they drink when it is free and it will save you a lot of headache don t forget soft drinks and water not only will there be people who don t want to or can t drink alcohol but you also need to make sure that the guests who are drinking alcohol are doing so safely and that means having access to non alcoholic drinks too plan the entertainment for the evening it may be that the venue is putting it on for you but if not then you will need to arrange it yourself at the least you want to make sure that you have music for people to dance to and this is sufficient entertainment for most people but if you have time and spare change in the budget then you could add entertainment such as casino tables bucking broncos magicians acrobats group games like giant jenga giant twister photobooth with fun props,Holidays-and-Traditions
how to behave at the office christmas party,making a fool of yourself at the office christmas party is something to be avoided at all costs after all you ll be obliged to front up to those very same co workers the following week and if they have a remarkably lowered opinion of you since the party it ll feel more than awkward while the christmas party can create worries for both employer and employee it is an event where you can still behave professionally and have fun and provides a great opportunity to socialize with co workers and bosses within your company whom you normally don t have a chance to mingle with it all comes down to the simple mantra behave right and you ll have a great night and here are some straightforward suggestions to keep this part of your work s social event calendar all sorted,prepare yourself mentally and show up rather than dreading the occasion the right mindset can provide much needed balance regardless of how you feel about the party or the office office parties are a crucial part of the office dynamic think of it like a sunday afternoon visit to grandma even if you don t feel like it you know that you probably should go accept that this is part of what is expected and expect to be able to talk to the people you do get along with at the very least it s a good opportunity to meet your superiors in a casual environment and a chance for networking with new people both are great things for career escalation it s also a good opportunity to get the wallflower into a good conversation you might be surprised and find a terrific person there if work is paying here s a chance to enjoy food and alcohol at work expense consider leaving early in advance when you re deciding whether or not to agree to going to the party it can help to reassure yourself that you can come up with a valid early exit strategy such as having to attend a kid s christmas concert or your spouse s business christmas party etc at least this way you can save face by turning up for part of the event but leaving before things become awkward or strange arrange for a friend to call you at a set time go out of earshot to take the call then return and say you must leave on an urgent matter some good excuses are your friend s car broke down on the highway or your roommate is locked out of the apartment decide what to wear find out what everyone else is wearing before the party and match the tone with your outfit if it s casual dress and you turn up smart that will immediately put you on the back foot and make the rest of the evening very uncomfortable it also opens you up as an easy target for derision the same applies the other way round if you are a woman find a compromise between i m attractive and sexy and take me seriously i m a professional revealing clothing while fun is not appropriate around your superiors think beyond the event to the image you d like your co workers to retain of you in months to come if everyone is heading straight to the party from work you don t have to worry as there won t be time to change so clearly work clothes are the go arrive on time this is an office party not a discotheque so turning up fashionably late is not an option and could have you missing out on all the fun arriving on time gives you the opportunity to say hello to everyone and still get out early without seeming rude mingle be sure to acknowledge all your co workers and especially your superiors and their associates as this will put you in good stead the christmas party is an excellent opportunity to cement relationships and to get known in a good way 1 x research source talk to your co workers and bosses about work issues in a positive and complimentary light focusing on achievements for the year and fun things you remember and don t be frightened to talk to your co workers and management about things outside of work such as the cinema football hobbies family or dogs and practice listening this is as important as the small talk even if there s someone you really don t like like steve from accounting it s best to have a quick chat with them and remember to use that winning smile while the occasion may feel really informal take care to still defer to superiors this isn t the time to be speaking your mind informally to management unless doing so is the norm in your workplace 2 x research source drink responsibly don t forget where you are technically still at work because you re with the work crowd so treat the party as an extension to your work day 3 x research source 4 x research source keep in mind that everything observed has the potential to be turned into a judgment on your professionalism and work suitability if there is one thing that can besmirch a reputation it s getting out of control on the liquor at the work christmas party no matter how much management has insisted that everyone let down their hair just don t wait until after the party if getting blind drunk is your plan grab the few trusted co workers and head off somewhere else at the party eat first before drinking drinking on an empty stomach is asking for trouble space all drinks with water and more food and lots of conversation join in the drinking so you don t look like a stiff but judge the tone carefully if it s a kicking party led from the top and you re having a good time you can let your hair down a little more than usual but do be aware of your limits and keep in mind that someone is always watching with an eye to judge in the workplace context under no circumstances allow yourself to get hammered the more drinks you have the more likely you are to do something that you ll regret avoid using alcohol as the excuse to let out a year s worth of pent up resentment and frustration about your boss co workers or the workplace in general telling them what you really think of them will be remembered forever more as the truth from your perspective and this can only harm your future prospects in the company be tactful and careful about declaring your undying romantic intentions it s that time of year if you re having an office blowout and jeanna from hr is there you may be tempted to make your move this can go either way remember you will have to see this person at work on monday think do i really fancy them do they like me how much have i had to drink will i regret this in the morning this is called a reality check if you fail the reality check under no circumstances should you make your move if however you have strong feelings for that person this may be the opportunity you ve been waiting for be discreet your co workers will gossip as soon as they see anything happen on the other hand you may find yourself being hit on even by your boss if this is not to your liking be tactful you don t want to damage relationships with your co workers or boss so let them down gently don t lead anyone on because you re drunk and you feel like it this will only create problems on monday especially if they like you more than you like them bear in mind the potential for claims of sexual harassment do not touch people in ways that can be misinterpreted or say things that are considered demeaning or sexually provocative use your common sense help others if you see a co worker overdoing the drinking or making a move when they are clearly not fully mentally cognizant step in and bail them out explain to them what they are doing and how it appears to other people if this doesn t sink in discreetly ring a cab and take them home this is one time where your own executive decision making can save their reputation you can always return to the party after if liked but don t bring up what you ve just done as it s a helping act to fix things quietly and with grace,Holidays-and-Traditions
