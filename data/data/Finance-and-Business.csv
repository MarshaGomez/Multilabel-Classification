how to use the rule of 72,the rule of 72 is a handy tool used in finance to estimate the number of years it would take to double a sum of money through interest payments given a particular interest rate the rule can also estimate the annual interest rate required to double a sum of money in a specified number of years the rule states that the interest rate multiplied by the time period required to double an amount of money is approximately equal to 72 the rule of 72 is applicable in cases of exponential growth as in compound interest or in exponential decay as in the loss of purchasing power caused by monetary inflation,let r x t 72 r is the rate of growth the annual interest rate and t is the time in years it takes for the amount of money to double 1 x research source insert a value for r for example how long does it take to turn 100 into 200 at a yearly interest rate of 5 letting r 5 we get 5 x t 72 2 x research source solve for the unknown variable in this example divide both sides of the above equation by r that is 5 to get t 72 5 14 4 so it takes 14 4 years for 100 to double at an interest rate of 5 per annum the initial amount of money doesn t matter it will take the same amount of time to double no matter what the beginning amount is study these additional examples how long does it take to double an amount of money at a rate of 10 per annum 10 x t 72 divide both sides of the equation by 10 so that t 7 2 years how long does it take to turn 100 into 1600 at a rate of 7 2 per annum recognize that 100 must double four times to reach 1600 100 200 200 400 400 800 800 1600 for each doubling 7 2 x t 72 so t 10 so as each doubling takes ten years the total time required to change 100 into 1 600 is 40 years let r x t 72 r is the rate of growth the interest rate and t is the time in years it takes to double any amount of money 3 x research source enter the value of t for example let s say you want to double your money in ten years what interest rate would you need in order to do that enter 10 for t in the equation r x 10 72 4 x research source solve for r divide both sides by 10 to get r 72 10 7 2 so you will need an annual interest rate of 7 2 in order to double your money in ten years estimate the time it would take to lose half of your money or its purchasing power in the wake of inflation let t 72 r this is the same equation as above just slightly rearranged now enter a value for r an example 5 x research source how long will it take for 100 to assume the purchasing power of 50 given an inflation rate of 5 per year let 5 x t 72 so that t 72 5 14 4 that s how many years it would take for money to lose half its buying power in a period of 5 inflation if the inflation rate were to change from year to year you would have to use the average inflation rate that existed over the full time period estimate the rate of decay r over a given time span r 72 t enter a value for t and solve for r for example 6 x research source if the buying power of 100 becomes 50 in ten years what is the inflation rate during that time r x 10 72 where t 10 then r 72 10 7 2 ignore any unusual data if you can detect a general trend don t worry about temporary numbers that are wildly out of range drop them from consideration understand how the derivation works for periodic compounding 7 x research source for periodic compounding fv pv 1 r t where fv future value pv present value r growth rate t time if money has doubled fv 2 pv so 2pv pv 1 r t or 2 1 r t assuming the present value is not zero solve for t by taking the natural logs on both sides and rearranging to get t ln 2 ln 1 r the taylor series for ln 1 r around 0 is r r2 2 r3 3 for low values of r the contributions from the higher power terms are small and the expression approximates r so that t ln 2 r note that ln 2 0 693 so that t 0 693 r or t 69 3 r expressing the interest rate as a percentage r from 0 100 which is the rule of 69 3 other numbers such as 69 70 and 72 are used for easier calculations understand how the derivation works for continuous compounding for periodic compounding with multiple compounding per year the future value is given by fv pv 1 r n nt where fv future value pv present value r growth rate t time and n number of compounding periods per year for continuous compounding n approaches infinity using the definition of e lim 1 1 n n as n approaches infinity the expression becomes fv pv e rt 8 x research source if money has doubled fv 2 pv so 2pv pv e rt or 2 e rt assuming the present value is not zero solve for t by taking natural logs on both sides and rearranging to get t ln 2 r 69 3 r where r 100r to express the growth rate as a percentage this is the rule of 69 3 for continuous compounding 69 3 or approximately 69 gives more accurate results since ln 2 is approximately 69 3 and r t ln 2 where r growth or decay rate t the doubling or halving time and ln 2 is the natural log of 2 70 may also be used as an approximation for continuous or daily which is close to continuous compounding for ease of calculation these variations are known as rule of 69 3 rule of 69 or rule of 70 a similar accuracy adjustment for the rule of 69 3 is used for high rates with daily compounding t 69 3 r 3 r the eckart mchale second order rule or e m rule gives a multiplicative correction to the rule of 69 3 or 70 but not 72 for better accuracy for higher interest rate ranges to compute the e m approximation multiply the rule of 69 3 or 70 result by 200 200 r i e t 69 3 r 200 200 r for example if the interest rate is 18 the rule of 69 3 says t 3 85 years the e m rule multiplies this by 200 200 18 giving a doubling time of 4 23 years which better approximates the actual doubling time 4 19 years at this rate the third order padé approximant gives even better approximation using the correction factor 600 4r 600 r i e t 69 3 r 600 4r 600 r if the interest rate is 18 the third order padé approximant gives t 4 19 years to estimate doubling time for higher rates adjust 72 by adding 1 for every 3 percentages greater than 8 that is t 72 r 8 3 r for example if the interest rate is 32 the time it takes to double a given amount of money is t 72 32 8 3 32 2 5 years note that 80 is used here instead of 72 which would have given 2 25 years for the doubling time here is a table giving the number of years it takes to double any given amount of money at various interest rates and comparing the approximation with various rules,Finance-and-Business

your annuity for example if you are now receiving 1 000 per month for the next 15 years sell your payments from years 5 through 10 only you will get a lump sum for those years but still receive your current payments up through year 4 you will then receive no monthly payments in years 5 through 10 but they will resume in years 11 through 15 know that this will result in a lower overall payout from your annuity you will get the money for the sold years up front but it will be lower than the total value of the payments from those years you also need to be sure of the value of the future payments before any deals are made this might be a good option if you need money now but know you will be able to support yourself during an upcoming time period consider selling as split purchases if your buyer makes a split purchase they will receive part of your monthly payment if you only need 500 a month and your annuity payment is 1 000 sell half your annuity you will get an immediate lump sum for

how to calculate an annual percentage growth rate,annual percentage growth rates are useful when considering investment opportunities 1 x research source municipalities schools and other groups also use the annual growth rate of populations to predict needs for buildings services etc as important and useful as these statistics are it is not difficult to calculate annual percentage growth rates,get the starting value to calculate the growth rate you re going to need the starting value the starting value is the population revenue or whatever metric you re considering at the beginning of the year for example if a village started the year with a population of 150 then the starting value is 150 get the final value to calculate the growth you ll not only need the starting value you ll also need the final value 2 x research source that value is the population revenue or whatever metric you re considering at the end of the year for example if a village ended the year with a population of 275 then the final value is 275 calculate the growth rate over one year the growth is calculated with the following formula growth percentage over one year finalvalue startvaluestartvalue 100 displaystyle frac finalvalue startvalue startvalue 100 3 x research source example problem a village grows from 150 people at the start of the year to 275 people at the end of the year calculate its growth percentage this year as follows growth percentage 275 150150 100 displaystyle frac 275 150 150 100 125150 100 displaystyle frac 125 150 100 0 8333 100 displaystyle 0 8333 100 83 33 displaystyle 83 33 get the starting value to calculate the growth rate you re going to need the starting value the starting value is the population revenue or whatever metric you re considering at the beginning of the period for example if the revenue of a company is 10 000 at the beginning of the period then the starting value is 10 000 get the final value to calculate the annual growth you ll not only need the starting value you ll also need the final value that value is the population revenue or whatever metric you re considering at the end of the period for example if the revenue of a company is 65 000 at the period then the final value is 65 000 determine the number of years since you re measuring the growth rate for a series of years you ll need to know the number of years during the period 4 x research source for example if you want to measure the annual revenue growth of a company between 2011 and 2015 then the number of years is 2015 2011 or 4 calculate the annual growth rate the formula for calculating the annual growth rate is growth percentage over one year fs 1y 1 100 displaystyle frac f s frac 1 y 1 100 where f is the final value s is the starting value and y is the number of years 5 x research source example problem a company earned 10 000 in 2011 that same company earned 65 000 four years later in 2015 what s the annual growth rate enter the values above into the growth rate formula to find the answer annual growth rate 6500010000 14 1 100 displaystyle frac 65000 10000 frac 1 4 1 100 6 514 1 100 displaystyle 6 5 frac 1 4 1 100 1 5967 1 100 displaystyle 1 5967 1 100 59 67 annual growth note raising a value a to the 1b displaystyle frac 1 b exponent is equivalent to taking the bth root of a you will likely need a calculator with an nx displaystyle n sqrt x button or a good online calculator,Finance-and-Business
how to calculate compound interest,compound interest is distinct from simple interest in that interest is earned both on the original investment the principal and the interest accumulated so far rather than simply on the principal because of this accounts with compound interest grow faster than those with simple interest for example if your interest compounds annually that means that you ll gain more interest in the second year after your investment than you did in the first year additionally the value will grow even faster if the interest is compounded multiple times per year compound interest is offered on a variety of investment products and also charged on certain types of loans like credit card debt 1 x research source calculating how much an amount will grow under compound interest is simple with the right equations,define annual compounding the interest rate stated on your investment prospectus or loan agreement is an annual rate if your car loan for example is a 6 loan you pay 6 interest each year compounding once at the end of the year is the easiest calculation for compounding interest 2 x research source a debt may compound interest annually monthly or even daily the more frequently your debt compounds the faster you will accumulate interest you can look at compound interest from the investor or the debtor s point of view frequent compounding means that the investor s interest earnings will increase at a faster rate it also means that the debtor will owe more interest while the debt is outstanding for example a savings account may be compounded annually while a pay day loan can be compounded monthly or even weekly calculate interest compounding annually for year one assume that you own a 1 000 6 savings bond issued by the us treasury treasury savings bonds pay out interest each year based on their interest rate and current value 3 x research source interest paid in year 1 would be 60 1 000 multiplied by 6 60 to calculate interest for the second year you need to add the original principal amount to all interest earned to date in this case the principal for year 2 would be 1 000 60 1 060 the value of the bond is now 1 060 and the interest payment will be calculated from this value compute interest compounding for later years to see the bigger impact of compound interest compute interest for later years as you move from year to year the principal amount continues to grow 4 x research source multiply the year 2 principal amount by the bond s interest rate 1 060 x 6 63 60 the interest earned is higher by 3 60 63 60 60 00 that s because the principal amount increased from 1 000 to 1 060 for year 3 the principal amount is 1 060 63 60 1 123 60 the interest earned in year 3 is 67 42 that amount is added to the principal balance for the year 4 calculation the longer a debt is outstanding the bigger the impact of compounding interest outstanding means that the debt is still owed by the debtor without compounding the year 2 interest would simply be 1 000 x 6 60 in fact every year s interest earned would be 60 if you did earn compound interest this is known as simple interest create an excel document to compute compound interest it can be handy to visualize compound interest by creating a simple model in excel that shows the growth of your investment start by opening a document and labeling the top cell in columns a b and c year value and interest earned respectively enter the years 0 5 in cells a2 to a7 enter your principal in cell b2 for example imagine you are started with 1 000 input 1000 in cell b3 type b2 1 06 and press enter this means that your interest is being compounded annually at 6 0 06 click on the lower right corner of cell b3 and drag the formula down to cell b7 the numbers will fill in appropriately place a 0 in cell c2 in cell c3 type b3 b 2 and press enter this should give you the difference between the values in cell b3 and b2 which represents the interest earned click on the lower right corner of cell c3 and drag the formula down to cell c7 the values will fill themselves in continue this process to replicate the process for as many years as you want to track you can also easily change values for principal and interest rate by altering the formulas used and cell contents learn the compound interest formula the compound interest formula solves for the future value of the investment after set number of years the formula itself is as follows fv p 1 ic n c displaystyle fv p 1 frac i c n c the variables within the equation are defined as follows fv is the future value this is the result of the calculation p is your principal i represents the annual interest rate c represents the compounding frequency how many times the interest compounds each year n represents the number of years being measured gather variables the compound interest formula if interest compounds more often than annually it is difficult to calculate the formula manually you can use a compound interest formula for any calculation to use the formula you need to gather the following information 6 x research source identify the principal of the investment this is the amount of your initial investment this could be how much you deposited into the account or the original cost of the bond for example imagine your principal in an investment account is 5 000 locate the interest rate for the debt the interest rate should be an annual amount stated as a percentage of the principal for example a 3 45 interest rate on the 5 000 principal value in the calculation the interest rate will have to be input as decimal convert it by dividing the interest rate by 100 in this example this would be 3 45 100 0 0345 you also need to know how often the debt compounds typically interest compounds annually monthly or daily for example imagine that it compounds monthly this means your compounding frequency c would be input as 12 determine the length of time you want to measure this could be a goal year for growth like 5 or 10 years or this maturity of a bond the maturity date of a bond is the date that the principal amount of the debt is to be repaid for the example we use 2 years so input 2 use the formula input your variables in the right places check again to make sure that you are inputting them correctly specifically make sure that your interest rate is in decimal form and that you have used the right number for c compounding frequency the example investment would be input as follows fv 5000 1 0 034512 2 12 displaystyle fv 5000 1 frac 0 0345 12 2 12 compute the exponent portion and the portion of the formula in parenthesis separately this is a math concept called order of operations you can learn more about the concept using this link apply the order of operations finish the math computations in the formula simplify the problem by solving for the parts of the equation in parenthesis first beginning with the fraction 7 x research source divide the fraction within parentheses first the result should be fv 5000 1 0 00288 2 12 displaystyle fv 5000 1 0 00288 2 12 add the numbers within parentheses the result should be fv 5000 1 00288 2 12 displaystyle fv 5000 1 00288 2 12 solve the multiplication within the exponent the last part above the closing parenthesis the result should look like this fv 5000 1 00288 24 displaystyle fv 5000 1 00288 24 raise the number within the parentheses to the power of the exponent this can be done on a calculator by entering the value in parentheses 1 00288 in the example first pressing the xy displaystyle x y button then entering the exponent 24 in this case and pressing enter the result in the example is fv 5000 1 0715 displaystyle fv 5000 1 0715 finally multiply the principal by the number in parentheses the result in the example is 5 000 1 0715 or 5 357 50 this is the value of the account at the end of the 2 years subtract the principal from your answer this will give you the amount of interest earned subtract the principal of 5 000 from the future value of 5357 50 to get 5 357 50 5 000 or 357 50 you will earn 357 50 in interest over the 2 years learn the formula compounding interest accounts can increase even faster if you make regular contributions to them such as adding a monthly amount to a savings account the formula is longer than that used to calculate compound interest without regular payments but follows the same principles the formula is as follows fv p 1 ic n c r 1 ic n c 1 ic displaystyle fv p 1 frac i c n c frac r 1 frac i c n c 1 frac i c 8 x research source the variables within the equation are also the same as the previous equation with one addition p is the principal i is the annual interest rate c is the compounding frequency and represents how many times the interest is compounded each year n is the number of years r is the amount of the monthly contribution compile the necessary variables to compute the future value of this type of account you will need the principal or present value of the account the annual interest rate the compounding frequency the number of years being measured and the amount of your monthly contribution this information should be in your investment agreement be sure to convert the annual interest rate into a decimal do this by dividing the rate by 100 for example using the above 3 45 interest rate we would divide 3 45 by 100 to get 0 0345 some accounts compound multiple times per year for example your account may have monthly compounding instead of annual for compounding frequency simply use the number of times per year that the interest compounds this means annually is 1 quarterly is 4 monthly is 12 and daily is 365 don t worry about leap years input your variables continuing with the example from above imagine that you decide to also contribute 100 per month to your account this account with a principal value of 5 000 compounds monthly and earns 3 45 annual interest we will measure the growth of the account over two years the completed formula using this information is as follows fv 5 000 1 0 034512 2 12 100 1 0 034512 2 12 1 0 034512 displaystyle fv 5 000 1 frac 0 0345 12 2 12 frac 100 1 frac 0 0345 12 2 12 1 frac 0 0345 12 solve the equation again remember to use the proper order of operations to do so this means that you start by calculating the values inside of parentheses solve for the fractions with parentheses first this means dividing i by c in three places all for the same result of 0 00288 the equation now looks like this fv 5 000 1 0 00288 2 12 100 1 0 00288 2 12 1 0 00288 displaystyle fv 5 000 1 0 00288 2 12 frac 100 1 0 00288 2 12 1 0 00288 solve the addition within the parentheses this means adding the 1 to the result from the last part this gives fv 5 000 1 00288 2 12 100 1 00288 2 12 1 0 00288 displaystyle fv 5 000 1 00288 2 12 frac 100 1 00288 2 12 1 0 00288 solve the multiplication within the exponents this means multiplying the 2 numbers that are smaller and above the closing parentheses in the example this is 2 12 for a result of 24 this gives fv 5 000 1 00288 24 100 1 00288 24 1 0 00288 displaystyle fv 5 000 1 00288 24 frac 100 1 00288 24 1 0 00288 solve the exponents this means raising the amount within parentheses to the result of the last step on a calculator this is done by entering the value in parentheses 1 00288 in the example pressing the xy displaystyle x y key and then entering the exponent value which is 24 here this gives fv 5 000 1 0715 100 1 0715 1 0 00288 displaystyle fv 5 000 1 0715 frac 100 1 0715 1 0 00288 subtract subtract the 1 from the result of the last step in the right part of the equation here 1 0715 minus 1 this gives fv 5 000 1 0715 100 0 0715 0 00288 displaystyle fv 5 000 1 0715 frac 100 0 0715 0 00288 multiply this means multiplying the principal by the number is the first set of parentheses and the monthly contribution by the same number in parentheses this gives fv 5 357 50 7 150 00288 displaystyle fv 5 357 50 frac 7 15 0 00288 divide the fraction this gives fv 5 357 50 2 482 64 displaystyle fv 5 357 50 2 482 64 add finally add the 2 numbers to get the future value of the account this gives 5 357 50 2 482 64 or 7 840 14 this is the value of the account after the 2 years subtract the principal and payments to find the interest earned you have to subtract the amount of money you put into the account this means adding the principal 5 000 to the total value of contributions made which is 24 contributions 2 years 12 months year times the 100 you put in each month for a total of 2 400 the total is 5 000 plus 2 400 or 7 400 subtracting 7 400 from the future value of 7 840 14 you get the amount of interest earned which is 440 14 extend your calculation to really see the benefit of compound interest imagine that you continue adding money monthly to the same account for 20 years instead of 2 in this case your future value would be about 45 000 even though you will have only contributed 29 000 meaning that you will have earned 16 000 in interest,Finance-and-Business
how to account for forward contracts,a forward contract is a type of derivative financial instrument that occurs between two parties the first party agrees to buy an asset from the second at a specified future date for a price specified immediately these types of contracts unlike futures contracts are not traded over any exchanges they take place over the counter between two private parties the mechanics of a forward contract are fairly simple which is why these types of derivatives are popular as a hedge against risk and as speculative opportunities knowing how to account for forward contracts requires a basic understanding of the underlying mechanics and a few simple journal entries,recognize a forward contract this is a contract between a seller and a buyer the seller agrees to sell a commodity in the future at a price upon which they agree today the seller agrees to deliver this asset in the future and the buyer agrees to purchase the asset in the future no physical exchange takes place until the specified future date this contract must be accounted for now when it is signed and again on the date when the physical exchange takes place 1 x research source for example suppose a seller agrees to sell grain to a buyer in 3 months for 12 000 but the current value of the grain is only 10 000 in one year when the exchange takes place the market value of the grain is 11 000 so in the end the seller makes a profit of 1 000 on the sale the spot rate or current value of the grain is 10 000 the forward rate or future value of the grain is 12 000 record a forward contract on the contract date on the balance sheet from the seller s perspective on the liability side of the equation you would credit the asset obligation for the spot rate then on the asset side of the equation you would debit the asset receivable for the forward rate finally debit or credit the contra asset account for the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate you would debit or decrease the contra asset account for a discount and credit or increase it for a premium 2 x research source using the example above the seller would credit the asset obligation account for 10 000 he has made a commitment to sell his grain today and today it is worth 10 000 but he is going to receive 12 000 for the grain so he debits assets receivable for 12 000 this is what he s going to be paid to account for the 2 000 premium he credits the contra asset account for 2 000 record a forward contract on the contract date on the balance sheet from the buyer s perspective on the liability side of the equation you would credit contracts payable in the amount of the forward rate then you would record the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate as a debit or credit to the contra assets account on the asset side of the equation you would debit assets receivable for the spot rate 3 x research source using the example above the buyer would credit contracts payable in the amount of 12 000 then he would debit the contra assets account for 2 000 to account for the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate then he would debit assets receivable for 10 000 record a forward contract on the balance sheet from the seller s perspective on the date the commodity is exchanged first you close out your asset and liability accounts on the liability side debit asset obligations by the spot value on the contract date on the asset side credit contracts receivable by the forward rate and debit or credit the contra assets account by the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate 4 x research source using the above example on the liability side you would debit asset obligations by 10 000 on the asset side you would credit contracts receivable by 12 000 then you would debit the contra asset account by 2 000 the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate recognize any gain or loss on the commodity sold from the seller s perspective determine the current market value of the commodity this is its value on the date of the physical exchange between the buyer and seller next debit or increase your cash account by the forward rate then credit or decrease your asset account by the current market value of the commodity finally recognize the gain or loss which is the difference between the forward rate and the current market value with a debit or credit on the asset account 5 x research source in the example above the current market value of the grain on the date of the physical exchange is 11 000 first the seller must increase cash based on the contracted amount so he would debit cash by 12 000 next he must reduce the asset account by the current market value by recording a credit of 11 000 then to recognize the gain of 1 000 which is the current value 11 000 less the spot rate 10 000 he would record a credit on the asset account of 1 000 record a forward contract on the balance sheet from the buyer s perspective on the date the commodity is exchanged first you close out your asset and liability accounts on the liability side debit contracts payable by the forward rate and debit or credit the contra assets account by the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate on the asset side credit assets receivable by the spot rate on the date of the contract 6 x research source using the example above on the liability side the buyer would debit contracts payable by 12 000 and credit the contra asset account by 2 000 on the asset side he would credit assets receivable by 10 000 recognize any gain or loss on the commodity sold from the buyer s perspective decrease or credit the cash account by the amount of the forward rate then record the difference between the forward rate and the current market value as an additional credit or debit to the cash account finally increase or debit the asset account by the current market value of the commodity 7 x research source in the above example the buyer would debit cash by 12 000 the difference between the market value 11 000 and the forward rate 12 000 is 1 000 they buyer lost 1 000 so he would record a debit to cash of 1 000 next he would debit the asset account by 11 000 understand the definition of a forward contract a forward contract is an agreement between a buyer and a seller to deliver a commodity on a future date for a specified price the value of the commodity on that future date is calculated using rational assumptions about rates of exchange farmers use forward contracts to eliminate risk for falling grain prices 8 x research source forward contracts are also used in transactions using foreign exchange in an effort to reduce the risk of losses due to changes in the exchange rates learn the meaning of derivatives a derivative is a security with a price that is based upon or derived from something else forward contracts are considered derivative financial instruments because the future value of the commodity is derived from other information about the commodity 9 x research source the future value of the commodity for the forward contract is derived from the current market value or spot price and the risk free rate of return learn the meaning of hedging in investing hedging means minimizing risk in forward contracts buyers and sellers attempt to minimize risk of losses by locking in prices for commodities in advance buyers lock in a price in hopes that they will end up paying less than the current market value of a commodity sellers hedge their risks with forward contracts in an attempt to protect themselves from falling prices 10 x research source know the difference between the long position and the short position the party agreeing to purchase the commodity assumes the long position the party agreeing to sell the commodity is assuming the short position 11 x research source the buyer who is in the long position is the person who stands to benefit if the price of the commodity rises higher than expected the seller who is in the short position stands to lose if the price of the commodity rises know the difference between the spot value and the forward value the spot value and the forward value are both quotes for the rate at which the commodity will be bought or sold the difference between the two has to do with the timing of the settlement and delivery of the commodity both parties in a forward contract need to know both values in order to accurately account for the forward contract 12 x research source the spot rate is the current market value for the asset in question it is the value of the commodity if it were sold today for example a farmer selling grain for the spot value agrees to sell it immediately for the current price 13 x research source the forward rate is the agreed upon future price in the contract for example suppose the farmer in the above example wants to enter into a forward contract in an effort to hedge against falling grain prices he can agree to sell his grain to another party in six months at agreed upon forward rate when the time comes to sell the grain will be sold for the agreed upon forward rate despite fluctuations that occur in the spot rate during the intervening six months 14 x research source understand the relationship between the spot value and the forward value the spot rate can be used to determine the forward rate this is because a commodity s future value is based in part on its current value the other factor that is used to determine the forward value is the risk free rate 15 x research source the risk free rate is the rate at which the commodity is expected to change in value with zero risk it is usually based on the current interest rate of a three month u s treasury bill which is considered the safest investment you can make 16 x research source,Finance-and-Business
how to use the rule of 72,the rule of 72 is a handy tool used in finance to estimate the number of years it would take to double a sum of money through interest payments given a particular interest rate the rule can also estimate the annual interest rate required to double a sum of money in a specified number of years the rule states that the interest rate multiplied by the time period required to double an amount of money is approximately equal to 72 the rule of 72 is applicable in cases of exponential growth as in compound interest or in exponential decay as in the loss of purchasing power caused by monetary inflation,let r x t 72 r is the rate of growth the annual interest rate and t is the time in years it takes for the amount of money to double 1 x research source insert a value for r for example how long does it take to turn 100 into 200 at a yearly interest rate of 5 letting r 5 we get 5 x t 72 2 x research source solve for the unknown variable in this example divide both sides of the above equation by r that is 5 to get t 72 5 14 4 so it takes 14 4 years for 100 to double at an interest rate of 5 per annum the initial amount of money doesn t matter it will take the same amount of time to double no matter what the beginning amount is study these additional examples how long does it take to double an amount of money at a rate of 10 per annum 10 x t 72 divide both sides of the equation by 10 so that t 7 2 years how long does it take to turn 100 into 1600 at a rate of 7 2 per annum recognize that 100 must double four times to reach 1600 100 200 200 400 400 800 800 1600 for each doubling 7 2 x t 72 so t 10 so as each doubling takes ten years the total time required to change 100 into 1 600 is 40 years let r x t 72 r is the rate of growth the interest rate and t is the time in years it takes to double any amount of money 3 x research source enter the value of t for example let s say you want to double your money in ten years what interest rate would you need in order to do that enter 10 for t in the equation r x 10 72 4 x research source solve for r divide both sides by 10 to get r 72 10 7 2 so you will need an annual interest rate of 7 2 in order to double your money in ten years estimate the time it would take to lose half of your money or its purchasing power in the wake of inflation let t 72 r this is the same equation as above just slightly rearranged now enter a value for r an example 5 x research source how long will it take for 100 to assume the purchasing power of 50 given an inflation rate of 5 per year let 5 x t 72 so that t 72 5 14 4 that s how many years it would take for money to lose half its buying power in a period of 5 inflation if the inflation rate were to change from year to year you would have to use the average inflation rate that existed over the full time period estimate the rate of decay r over a given time span r 72 t enter a value for t and solve for r for example 6 x research source if the buying power of 100 becomes 50 in ten years what is the inflation rate during that time r x 10 72 where t 10 then r 72 10 7 2 ignore any unusual data if you can detect a general trend don t worry about temporary numbers that are wildly out of range drop them from consideration understand how the derivation works for periodic compounding 7 x research source for periodic compounding fv pv 1 r t where fv future value pv present value r growth rate t time if money has doubled fv 2 pv so 2pv pv 1 r t or 2 1 r t assuming the present value is not zero solve for t by taking the natural logs on both sides and rearranging to get t ln 2 ln 1 r the taylor series for ln 1 r around 0 is r r2 2 r3 3 for low values of r the contributions from the higher power terms are small and the expression approximates r so that t ln 2 r note that ln 2 0 693 so that t 0 693 r or t 69 3 r expressing the interest rate as a percentage r from 0 100 which is the rule of 69 3 other numbers such as 69 70 and 72 are used for easier calculations understand how the derivation works for continuous compounding for periodic compounding with multiple compounding per year the future value is given by fv pv 1 r n nt where fv future value pv present value r growth rate t time and n number of compounding periods per year for continuous compounding n approaches infinity using the definition of e lim 1 1 n n as n approaches infinity the expression becomes fv pv e rt 8 x research source if money has doubled fv 2 pv so 2pv pv e rt or 2 e rt assuming the present value is not zero solve for t by taking natural logs on both sides and rearranging to get t ln 2 r 69 3 r where r 100r to express the growth rate as a percentage this is the rule of 69 3 for continuous compounding 69 3 or approximately 69 gives more accurate results since ln 2 is approximately 69 3 and r t ln 2 where r growth or decay rate t the doubling or halving time and ln 2 is the natural log of 2 70 may also be used as an approximation for continuous or daily which is close to continuous compounding for ease of calculation these variations are known as rule of 69 3 rule of 69 or rule of 70 a similar accuracy adjustment for the rule of 69 3 is used for high rates with daily compounding t 69 3 r 3 r the eckart mchale second order rule or e m rule gives a multiplicative correction to the rule of 69 3 or 70 but not 72 for better accuracy for higher interest rate ranges to compute the e m approximation multiply the rule of 69 3 or 70 result by 200 200 r i e t 69 3 r 200 200 r for example if the interest rate is 18 the rule of 69 3 says t 3 85 years the e m rule multiplies this by 200 200 18 giving a doubling time of 4 23 years which better approximates the actual doubling time 4 19 years at this rate the third order padé approximant gives even better approximation using the correction factor 600 4r 600 r i e t 69 3 r 600 4r 600 r if the interest rate is 18 the third order padé approximant gives t 4 19 years to estimate doubling time for higher rates adjust 72 by adding 1 for every 3 percentages greater than 8 that is t 72 r 8 3 r for example if the interest rate is 32 the time it takes to double a given amount of money is t 72 32 8 3 32 2 5 years note that 80 is used here instead of 72 which would have given 2 25 years for the doubling time here is a table giving the number of years it takes to double any given amount of money at various interest rates and comparing the approximation with various rules,Finance-and-Business

how to prepare for capital expenditures capex,capital expenditures or capex is the money you invest back into your company so that it can grow and continue operating typically these expenses take the form of purchases of real estate buildings equipment or technology that your company will use for several years to plan for capital expenditures create a budget separate from the day to day expenses of running your business that takes into account company growth and the overall health of the economy 1 x research source,separate capital expenditures from operating expenditures operating expenditures are the day to day expenses required to keep your business running such as office supplies and utilities capital expenditures on the other hand are expenses for equipment tools property and other assets that your company will use for several years 2 x research source keeping your capex budget separate from your operating budget makes it easier to do your taxes because deductions for capital expenses are made over a number of years as depreciation while operating expenses are deducted in full in the year you incur them 3 x research source capex budgets often span longer than a year which is another good reason to keep them separate from your operating expenses 4 x research source for example you might anticipate building a new factory or warehouse which could take several years to construct and put into operation total your company s need for capital expenditures assess your current equipment buildings technology and other capital assets determine when each will need upgrades or maintenance and how much those things will cost this will give you a rough idea of how much your company needs to budget for capital expenditures 5 x research source many of these needs are fairly predictable for example if your company relies on desktop computers you might estimate that those computers need to be replaced every 3 years adding up the replacement cost for each computer gives you an idea of how much your company will need to spend on computers every 3 years your needs might also be based on your company s growth for example you might need to upgrade equipment when your production doubles if you have a larger company work with your department heads to determine your capex needs because they work with the equipment and technology on a regular basis they ll have a better idea of what upgrades and maintenance are needed create a maximum spending limit based on your needs the specific costs for necessary upgrades maintenance and eventual replacement of your capital assets give you a base amount for your capital expenditures however you ll need to budget more than that to account for any changes that might occur or unforeseen circumstances that might arise 6 x research source taking company income into account set the top end of your spending range at 1 5 to 2 times the expenses you ve already found when setting your maximum spending limit consider the position of your company and your projections for the future if you re optimistic about growth and your sales are trending upward you might set a higher spending limit than you would if your company was in the midst of a slump in performance time expenditures based on company income and growth some expenses may not be necessary at all for several years careful planning allows your company to save for those expenses in advance so the money s there when you need it 7 x research source for example suppose you know you ll need to spend 10 000 on new computers in 5 years if you budget 2 000 a year towards those computers you ll have the money when you need to purchase them other expenses might be triggered by a specific event for example if you know you ll need to upgrade your production equipment when your sales double look at the amount of money you ll need to complete the necessary upgrades and determine when your company will have that money available this helps you plan your growth strategy and sales goals so that your company doesn t grow beyond its means adjust your capex budget based on the economy national and global economic trends may affect your capex budget since it s difficult if not impossible to predict the state of the economy 5 to 10 years down the road adjustments are necessary in the event of a downturn 8 x trustworthy source financial industry regulatory agency non governmental organization responsible for regulating brokerage firms and exchange markets go to source for example if the economy is currently booming and your sector is doing well you might optimistically plan to invest more of the company s income on capital expenses however if a recession is looming 2 years later you d want to go back and adjust your capex budget accordingly so you could keep your business ahead of the curve find the value for depreciation on the income statement your business s most current income statement has a line with a value for depreciation and amortization of capital assets use this value to infer net capital expenditures indirectly 9 x research source make sure you have full financial reports for the same period since you ll need entries from other reports to calculate net capital expenditures check the balance sheet for pp e look in the assets section of your company s balance sheet for a line that provides the value of your company s property plant and equipment often abbreviated pp e you ll see the value for the current accounting period in the second column the first column gives you the value for the previous period 10 x research source the value of assets decreases over time through depreciation so don t be surprised if the amount for the current period is lower than the value for the previous period subtract the prior period s pp e from the current pp e subtracting the prior period s pp e from the current period s pp e gives you the net increase in pp e for the period if your current pp e is lower than the prior period s pp e you ll end up with a negative number which means the value of your pp e assets is decreasing 11 x research source for example suppose your company s pp e is 25 000 for the current period and 27 000 for the previous period you would have a net increase in pp e of 2 000 which you could also express as a net decrease in pp e of 2 000 add depreciation to infer the net capital expenditures for the period use the depreciation figure you found on your company s income statement adding this expense to the net increase in pp e tells you your net capital expenditures for the period if your net increase in pp e was negative add the depreciation to the negative number 12 x trustworthy source financial industry regulatory agency non governmental organization responsible for regulating brokerage firms and exchange markets go to source for example if your company has a net increase in pp e of 2 000 and depreciation expenses of 4 000 you would have net capital expenditures of 2 000 2 000 4 000 2 000 once you ve calculated your net capital expenditures compare them to your budget if your net capital expenditures exceed the maximum spending limit you budgeted go back and rework your budget accordingly if your company s net capital expenditures are greater than the depreciation this means your company s assets are growing over time conversely net capital expenditures that are less than the depreciation indicate shrinking assets,Finance-and-Business
how to calculate cumulative growth,cumulative growth is a term used to describe a percentage of increase over a set period of time cumulative growth can be used to measure growth in the past and thereby to plan for population growth estimate organic cell growth measure sales growth and so on it is a useful descriptive tool in figuring out how growth has developed over time or how growth will continue to develop investors marketers and business planners need to know how to calculate cumulative growth often expressed as cagr cumulative average growth rate because it appears frequently in the financial sections of companies annual reports 1 x research source the following article discusses several ways to go about finding and using cagr,identify the values needed to calculate cagr in order to calculate cagr you will need a few essential values this includes the starting value ending or finishing value and the period of time over which you wish to measure growth determine the starting value sv of an asset for example the price paid for a share of stock determine the ending value ev or current market value of that asset determine the period of time t you want to study for example the number of years months quarters etc 2 x research source input these values in the cagr formula after you ve gotten your information together input your variables into the cagr equation the equation is as follows cagr ev sv 1 t 1 3 x research source solve for cagr after your values have been inputted in the cagr equation simply solve for cagr using the proper order of operations that is be sure to calculate the 1 t first because it is an exponent then solve for ev sv and raise that number to the power found in the first step finally subtract 1 from the number you just found the result will be your cagr for example if a portfolio of investments had an initial value of 10 000 that grew to 19 500 over 3 years you would start with cagr 19 500 10 000 1 3 1 and simplify to cagr 1 95 0 333 1 and cagr 1 249 1 your final result would be cagr 0 249 or 24 9 calculate cagr using an online calculator perhaps the simplest way to calculate cagr is to use an online cagr calculator these programs allow you to simply input your values for sv ev and t and will do the rest of the work for you in order to find one of these calculators try searching on a search engine for cagr calculator 4 x research source calculate cagr using microsoft excel another simple way to calculate cagr is to used microsoft excel other spreadsheet programs will likely perform this function just as well but may require different formula structures see help guides for these programs to learn how to perform these functions in any case start by inputting your values sv ev and t into cells in a new spreadsheet for example put sv into a1 ev into b1 and t into c1 the easiest way to calculate cagr in excel is to simply enter the cagr formula into a fourth cell this requires entering the following into d1 or any other cell you see fit b1 a1 1 c1 1 excel will complete the calculations for you and the result will be presented in whichever cell you choose for the equation 5 x research source an alternate method of calculating cagr in excel uses the power function which calculates equations using exponents for this calculation create a cell for the formula and enter power b1 a1 1 c1 1 again the answer should appear in this cell after you press enter 6 x research source additionally excel can calculate cagr by using the rate function input this formula into a new cell by entering the following rate c1 a1 b1 press enter and excel will display the answer 7 x research source identify the values needed to calculate cagr cagr can also be used to predict future growth based upon a historical cagr 8 x research source this is done similarly to calculating a historical cagr in order to calculate future value you will need a few essential values this includes the starting value ending or finishing value and the period of time over which you wish to measure growth determine the starting value sv of an asset for example the price paid for a share of stock or the current revenues of a company determine the period of time t you want to study for example the number of years months quarters etc 9 x research source enter the cagr percentage as a decimal for example the cagr percentage of 24 9 calculated in method one would be entered here at 0 249 calculate future value using cagr future values can be calculated using the following formula fv sv 1 cagr t simply input the values you have decided on and calculate the future value in a similar way to calculating cagr you can either calculate this value by calculator or using a computer to calculate this on a computer use a spreadsheet program and enter the program into an empty cell for example a potential calculation in excel would start with sv in cell a1 cagr in cell d1 and t in cell c1 to calculate fv enter the following into an empty cell a1 1 d1 c1 and press enter 10 x research source analyze your result when using your cagr to predict future values keep in mind that no historical data can accurately predict the future however using a cagr can serve as a somewhat reliable estimate of future growth 11 x research source keep in mind also that this cagr represents an average of the growth of the represented values and

how to find the total amount paid in an interest rate equation,if you have been given a math problem that requires you to find the total amount of money paid over a certain period of time don t worry these equations are simple to solve if you understand what the parts of the equation are and how to use them,understand the terms you will be working with in your interest rate equation when you are solving an interest rate equation such as that for an interest rate you have for a loan you took out you will work with several different variables these include p principal amount borrowed i the interest rate n the term of the loan in years f the total amount paid at the end of the designated number of years know the equation used to calculate the total amount you will pay to find the total amount paid at the end of the number of years you pay back your loan for you will have to multiply the principal amount borrowed with 1 plus the interest rate then raise that sum to the power of the number of years the equation looks like this f p 1 i n read through the equation you are given and determine which numbers coincide with each variable of the equation normally interest rate problems will be given in sentence format and you will have to figure out what each number represents for example you are given you borrow 4 000 from a bank and promise to repay the loan principal plus the accumulated interest in four years at a rate of 10 per year how much would you repay at the end of 4 years p would be 4 000 i would be 10 n would be 4 years f would be what you are trying to find plug the known numbers into the equation for fixed rate once you have figured out what numbers you are working with you can plug the numbers in so that you can work with the equation to find the fixed rate our equation would be f 4000 1 10 4 note that to make things easier you can convert the interest percentage to decimals so the equation would be f 4000 1 0 1 4 work through the problem in stages in order to find the total amount you will pay over the course of the time you pay back a loan you will have to work through the article in stages let s look at an example article you borrow 5 000 from a bank and plan to repay the loan principal plus and accumulated interest in five years the rate of the interest is 10 how much will you pay in total at the end of the five years create your equation once you have read through the article create an equation based on the standard equation f p 1 i n for our question our equation would be f 5000 1 0 1 5 solve the inside of the parentheses first when you have written out your equation start to solve your problem the first step towards doing this is to solve the equation within the parentheses first for our equation solve 1 0 1 1 1 so now our equation looks like this f 5000 1 1 5 use n to solve the next part of the equation once you have simplified the information in the parentheses you should move onto applying the years n of the equation this means raising the number inside the parentheses to the nth degree for our equation 1 1 5 means multiplying 1 1 to itself five times in this case 1 1 5 1 61051 finish the equation you should now only have one step left in the process of solving your equation to finish the equation and find f or the total amount paid you will have to multiply p with the number in the parentheses for our equation f 5000 1 61051 therefore f 8 052 55 that means that you would have paid 8 052 55 over the course of the five years,Finance-and-Business

how to effectively track and accomplish your goals,when it comes to accomplishing goals one thing that many people tend to neglect is that usually goals must be consistently tracked and reviewed this article points out the importance of tracking your goals and suggests four different approaches for how to effectively track your goals according to the different nature of the goal itself main thing you can take away from this article is that no matter what type of goals you set you should always find something to track your progress,effectively track your goals one of the most common reasons that people don t get to accomplish their goals is that we tend to get distracted and we lose track of important things that need to be done consistently in order to move forward towards our goals maybe you have set a perfectly achievable goal and planned every detailed step but without effectively tracking your goal and knowing your progress most certainly you will get discouraged when the first obstacle gets in the way and end up giving up on your goal eventually 1 x research source discipline yourself to keep on track to really achieve any goal that is worthwhile until it s accomplished there are several ways to effectively track your goals review your goals regularly preferably daily 2 x research source keep yourself constantly reminded of your goals by reviewing them at a specific time each day it can be in the morning first thing after you get out of the bed it can be at night just before you go to sleep write down all your goals in a notebook or store them in a computer software when you review them envision how accomplishing that goal will make you feel check your current progress understand what you did to move it forward find out what else you still need to do by doing this regularly you train your mind to become alert to things that are related to your goals and gradually your mind will automatically guide you to do whatever needed to achieve them break down a goal into actionable steps 3 x research source many people tend to easily get overwhelmed by all the things they need to do to accomplish a goal the trick is to break down a bigger goal into smaller actionable steps for example say your goal is to start your own business there are many things you will need to do but before spending too much time on thinking about how difficult or time consuming they will be first break things down a bit for instance obviously first few steps towards your goal could be decide an overall direction or business model find a right product service to sell list requirements to make this product service work etc if any of these steps still looks big break it down further once you break it down to doable steps all you need to focus on is just one small step as long as you keep doing these small steps the completion of the goal will take care of itself break down a goal into quantifiable results 4 x research source find a measurable aspect of your goal and write it down as a number for example your goal could be to lose weight then the number is your body weight if you want to finish reading or studying a book the number is the number of pages to read if your goal is to save money for a dream vocation the number is the amount of money you put in a bank account as long as you know what this number is you will always know your progress all that s left is just to keep doing things that help you move that number closer to your goal s end result and stop doing what doesn t change the number track a goal by the amount of time you spend on it 5 x research source there are certain kind of goals that can t be easily broken down to definitive steps it is often difficult to find any obvious measurable aspects for their end result they can be goals such as stay in shape have a peaceful mind become more fluent in a foreign language etc for this type of goals you can try tracking the amount of time you spend on doing things required by them for instance to stay in shape track how many hours you work out per week for having a peaceful mind track how much time you spend meditating or doing yoga per day for becoming fluent in a foreign language track how much time you spend practicing speaking the language per day so on and so forth,Finance-and-Business

and to do a remodel driveway repaving and fix the roof however the refi wasn t as much as they wanted so they ve had yard sales and also sold some recreational vehicles and assets of their youth they re semi retired and they also sold one of their two cars they re going to either buy a smaller home or retire to a senior community they haven t decided which yet though they do have a fair retirement nest egg built up though that they d like to avoid drawing down from for as long as possible so now one of them pays a friend to transport her to doctor s and dental appointments grocery shopping etc and this was all worked out on a mileage basis with amounts factored in for repairs insurance and fees etc her husband though working and helping her run the small business went back to school and

how to transfer property after the death of a parent,the death of a parent can be a traumatic and difficult time however if they left you some of their property you may need to go to court to get that property transferred into your name the process you ll use varies depending on whether your parent had a trust or a will if they left behind a small estate and didn t have a will or trust you can use an affidavit to take control of the property without going through probate regardless of how you transfer the property you can t get started until you have a copy of your parent s death certificate 1 x research source,go over the trust documents typically the trustee will send notice to you within a couple of months after your parent s death this notice includes information about your parent s trust as well as a copy of the trust documents these documents detail the property your parent left in the trust and lists the people who are beneficiaries of the trust 2 x research source trust documents can contain a lot of complex language and legalese if you don t understand the information in the trust documents you might want to have the trustee or an attorney go over the documents with you contact the trustee named in the trust if your parent s trust names someone as trustee they will be responsible for settling the trust and distributing the assets if your parent had a living trust in which they were the trustee you ll be looking for the successor trustee 3 x research source if your other parent is living they may be named as the trustee if your parents were divorced on the other hand it s possible that you are listed as the trustee however if you are listed as a beneficiary of the trust you can t also serve as trustee some trusts list an institution such as your parent s bank as the trustee most institutions have specific individuals that serve as trustees on behalf of the institution wait for the trustee to pay creditors and taxes the trustee is responsible for sending notice to creditors and paying all the debts and taxes that are owed by your deceased parent in some situations this involves selling assets from the trust to pay what is owed with the typical trust this shouldn t take longer than a year 4 x research source for example if your parent owed 100 000 and the only asset in the trust was a house the house would have to be sold to pay your parent s debt any leftover money would go to the beneficiaries of the trust complete any necessary documents to transfer the property the documents required to transfer property after all debts and taxes are paid depend on the type of property for most personal property no documents are required to transfer ownership of the property however you will need documents to transfer the ownership of real estate or titled property such as cars or boats 5 x research source for example if your parent left you their car you would need the title for the car to transfer the ownership to your name if the car was held by the trust the title would be in the name of the trust the trustee would fill out the title to transfer ownership from the trust to you read your parent s will to determine what property was left to you reading your parent s will can be a difficult task mentally and emotionally especially if the two of you were close you might want to get a friend or loved one to sit with you as you read it generally the will lists your parent s property and the specific items they want to leave to specific people if any some wills are relatively short and simply leave all of the person s property to one person while others are more detailed 6 x research source sometimes it can be difficult to find your parent s will especially if they didn t tell you where it was before they died check safe deposit boxes or other places where you know your parent kept important personal papers some people also file a will with the clerk of the county court although this isn t a legal requirement it ensures that you can easily find the will call the county court in the county where your parent lived and find out if they allow people to file wills if they do they ll explain the procedure for retrieving your parent s will if it s there if you know the name of your parent s attorney call them and ask them about the will if they drafted your parent s will they might have a copy of it calculate the value of your parent s estate courts have different requirements for probate depending on the value of your parent s estate if your parent left few assets you might be able to use simplified procedures that don t require as much time and effort as the full formal probate procedures 7 x research source for this calculation you re just looking for a ballpark estimate generally if your parent owns real estate they re probably over the threshold however if your parent only owns a vehicle and some personal property such as furniture clothing and household goods they likely fall below the threshold the specific threshold for formal probate varies among states however it s typically over 50 000 8 x research source in some states such as california it s as high as 100 000 9 x research source identify the personal representative of your parent s estate your parent s personal representative is the person who will be responsible for the administration of their estate including paying their creditors and distributing their property if your parent has a will they likely named the person they wanted to be their personal representative 10 x research source if the personal representative your parent named in their will is not available see if your parent named an alternate if they didn t you ll have to determine who is willing to serve in this capacity choose someone who is mentally and emotionally prepared to take on this role you can also hire a lawyer to serve as your parent s personal representative however this is usually a more expensive option than using someone who is a close friend or member of the family avoid naming someone who is listed as a beneficiary in the will as your parent s personal representative for example if you know that you re getting the majority of your parent s property you probably shouldn t serve as their personal representative choose the correct probate court typically you ll use the probate court in the county where your deceased parent lived if your deceased parent owned property in a different county you might also be able to use the probate court there 11 x research source for example your parent might own a house in one county but spent the last few months of their life in a hospice in the neighboring county in that situation you would likely want to file your application in the probate court for the county where your parent s house is located if you call the clerk of the probate court they can help you figure out which court you should use you may also be able to find information on the court s website submit your parent s will to the clerk of court some probate courts require you to submit the will you want to be probated before you file an application or petition to start the actual court process call the clerk s office they ll be able to let you know if you need to submit the will and what the specific process is for doing that 12 x research source usually there will also be information about the process on the probate court s website typically you need to bring the will to the clerk s office in person you may also need to submit copies of the will however before you submit the will make at least one copy for your own records complete an application for probate the probate court you use will likely have a form that you can fill out if you re using simplified procedures for formal probate you ll typically have to hire an attorney to draft a formal petition 13 x research source you ll have to pay a filing fee when you file your application these fees vary greatly from state to state and in many states even from county to county however they re typically a few hundred dollars if you re filing the application yourself you ll likely have to pay these fees out of pocket initially but you can get reimbursed from your parent s estate hire an attorney to assist with the administration of the estate if you were chosen as your parent s personal representative you ll typically want to hire an attorney to help you the attorney s fees are paid by your parent s estate 14 x research source if your parent doesn t have substantial assets or a lot of debt the administration of the estate might be relatively simple in that situation you might not need to hire an attorney but you still definitely want to talk to one most attorneys who specialize in estate planning offer a free initial consultation if you are planning on hiring an attorney it s a good idea to meet with 2 or 3 local attorneys so you can choose the one who best suits your needs also make sure you pick someone you get along with because you re likely going to be working with them for at least a year attend court hearings as necessary to distribute property with simplified procedures you typically only have to go to court once however if you end up needing formal probate you ll likely need to attend several court hearings for the judge to approve the distribution of property 15 x research source formal probate proceedings can take anywhere from 6 months to a year for more complex estates expect it to take longer if your parent had a lot of debt or if they had a substantial estate with numerous investments create a list of heirs list all of your parent s living relatives and show your relationship to them if your parent died without a will typically you need to be their next of kin if you want their property transferred into your name if you are not the next of kin or if you have other siblings you ll need letters or affidavits from them stating that they have no interest in the property 16 x research source for example if you have a sister and your parent has a brother who has 2 kids you would typically list your uncle 2 cousins yourself and your sister on your list of heirs you and your sister would be considered your parent s next of kin assuming your parent was divorced or your other parent was not living if you aren t close to your parent s family and have no idea who is still living there are ways you can publish a notice of their death calling for heirs to come forward the clerk of the probate court will help you with this check with banks or other institutions for an affidavit form many banks and other institutions that might have control of your parent s assets have their own affidavit form using that form makes it easier to get your parent s property because the form includes all the information the institution needs to release the property to you 17 x research source for example if your parent had a bank account go to one of that bank s branches explain the situation and ask if they have an affidavit form for you to fill out the website for your state court system might also have affidavit forms that you can use banks and other institutions will also accept these forms provided all the information they need is included on the form fill out the affidavits that you need the affidavit requires you to provide information about the death of your parent and any proceedings that are being conducted in court or have already been conducted in court regarding their estate typically if you re transferring property using an affidavit there won t be any court proceedings you ll also need to provide details about the property that you want to be transferred to you 18 x research source if there are other heirs they ll likely need to sign your affidavits as well for example if you have a sibling they would need to sign the affidavit even if you re the only one submitting it if someone else signs the affidavit who won t be present when you submit the affidavit typically their signature needs to be notarized even if yours does not gather ownership documents for the property in addition to your parent s death certificate the institution holding the property needs proof that your parent owned the property you re trying to take ownership of generally the institution will tell you exactly what documents or information you ll need 19 x research source for example if your parent had a bank account you ll typically need to know the bank account number and the name on the account you might also need your parent s debit card if they had one a recent bank statement would have the information that you need some property has a specific ownership document for example if your parent owned a car you would use the title in their name to prove their ownership with their death certificate and an affidavit you could then get the title transferred to your name submit your affidavits to the relevant authorities for titled property such as cars or boats you ll typically submit your affidavit to the local title office to get the title transferred to your name for banking or investment accounts submit the affidavit and supporting documents to the financial institution that s holding the account 20 x research source for items of personal property that don t have a title or other documentation usually you can simply take it you might consider getting a friend or family member to come with you to help clean out their place or at least to be there for moral support,Finance-and-Business

your annuity should be the only information they ask for do not give your social security number bank information or pay any fees to obtain a free quote give yourself as much time as you can to make

payments as scheduled consider this option if you have a temporary shortage of cash but would like to continue investing in your retirement consider selling as a reverse purchase sell several years of your annuity for example if you are now receiving 1 000 per month for the next 15 years sell your payments from years 5 through 10 only you will get a lump sum for those years but still receive your current payments up through year 4 you will then receive no monthly payments in years 5 through 10 but they will resume in years 11 through 15 know that this will result in a lower overall payout from your annuity you will get the money for the sold years up front but it will be lower than the total value of the payments from those years you also need to be sure of the value of the future payments before any deals are made this might be a good option if you need money now but know you will be able to support yourself during an upcoming time period consider selling as split purchases if your buyer makes a split purchase they will receive part of your monthly payment if you only need 500 a month and your annuity payment is 1 000 sell half your annuity you will get an immediate lump sum for the half you don t need and continue to receive monthly payments of 500 even though you ve only sold half the annuity you will still pay ordinary income taxes on the deferred earnings and any gains

difficult to decide exactly what your company s core values should be take your time and choose the values that most represent who you are as a business owner and the image you want for your company thoroughly integrate those core values into your company s operations and they will become a seamless part of your branding 1 x research source,choose a team to work on company values if you have a relatively small company your team may only consist of you and a couple of managers or other key employees in a larger company however take care to ensure that the people on the team are people who have a track record with the company and feel passionate about the same things you do 2 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source choose people who you know are loyal to your company and will likely be with you for the long haul they should also be ideal employees who go above and beyond in their roles every day it isn t usually the best idea to just allow all of your employees to work on setting your company s values this could mean including employees who aren t truly dedicated to your company and won t be with you for long including all employees can also send the message that everyone s opinion is equally important when that might not necessarily be the case typically the opinions of the company s owners would be more important when it comes to something as important as the company s values brainstorm values that are important to you individually particularly if you started the company yourself it s likely that the company reflects your own personal values personal values are also some of the easiest to convert into company values because you already use these principals to make your decisions 3 x expert source lauren krasny executive strategic personal coach expert interview 27 march 2020 for example if you value creativity you ve likely already used a more creative approach to tackling challenges that arose in business it s also likely that you ve asked potential employees if they consider themselves creative or sought out creative ideas to help your business

a fairly common value particularly in the financial sector however it won t distinguish you from the field unless your company happens to hold a standard of integrity higher than the rest distinguish between core values and aspirational values your company s core values are a part of every company action and inform every decision often they reflect the values of the company s founders aspirational values on the other hand are things you want but that your company currently lacks 5 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source for example suppose you have bravery listed as a value if your company operates traditionally and makes conservative decisions there s nothing brave about that you may want your company to grow into a business that has the courage to make riskier decisions but if it s not there yet bravery can t really be one of your core values while there s nothing wrong with aspirational values you can t use them to define your company as it currently exists choose core values that your company currently embodies narrow down your list to 3 5 core values you want your company s values to be easy for your employees and customers to remember if you list too many values it might be difficult to keep up with all of them and they ll also be difficult to integrate into your business discuss the list you have with your team to decide which are the most important for your company as a whole 6 x research source think about the ways the values interact with each other if you have values listed that would frequently conflict with each other eliminate at least one if not both of them for example you wouldn t want two of your values to be traditionalism and uniqueness because those would frequently be at odds one way to narrow down a long list of values is to group them into related values then choose one that the others or most of the others in that group could fall under for example in a group with values such as compassion love caring charity and empathy you might decide that the word empathy encompasses all of the other words 7 x expert source lauren krasny executive strategic personal coach expert interview 27 march 2020 create a summary heading for each of your values a single word or catchy phrase makes your values more memorable using a single word to define each of your core values also enables you to plug your values into a lot of different aspects of your business easily 8 x research source while it s not always possible you might be

culture 9 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source for example suppose you have an outdoors company and your values are challenge humor adventure risk taking and passion you can put those together to spell charp which may not be a real word but it s one you can use to unite your team around those values add detail to describe exactly what the value means to your company after your heading add a couple of sentences that put that value into context and describes exactly how your company exemplifies that value use we and us to emphasize that the company as a unit embodies these values 10 x research source for example if one of your values is adventure you might describe that by writing we believe that every challenge is an opportunity and every opportunity is an adventure we thrill to find small adventures in everyday life get employee input on how core values are expressed you have your core values and you have a good idea of what you mean by them and what they mean to your company come up with at least a couple ways to express those ideas that you can float to your employees to find out which resonates best 11 x research source for example if one of your values is adventure your employees might prefer a description that emphasizes that not all adventures are necessarily fun while they re happening because they might be concerned that requiring an element of fun puts too much pressure on them your company values will help define your company culture and

simply mention your company s core values once during training and then never bring them up again they won t affect the behavior of your employees or the direction of your business creating signs and putting them up everywhere ensures that those values become a part of the regular working vocabulary 14 x research source if your employees are frequently in front of computers create a logo or

how to close revenue accounts,if you re just getting started in the world of accounting closing temporary accounts such as revenue accounts is how you close out the accounting cycle the balances in these accounts don t roll over into the next period after you go through the closing process rather you zero them out at the end of the accounting period which may be monthly quarterly or yearly generally to close the revenue accounts you move the balances to a temporary income summary account deduct expense balances then distribute any remaining earnings to the appropriate capital accounts 1 x research source,open a spreadsheet with 3 columns use the first column for the names of the various temporary accounts title the second column debit and the third column credit each account will have its own row 2 x research source title your spreadsheet trial balance with the date you might also include additional information such as the period of the accounting annual quarterly or monthly enter each account in a row in the first column copy the names of the accounts from the general ledger account depending on the type of business you may have account names such as accounts payable or loans payable in addition to a general revenue account 3 x research source the order of the accounts is up to you you may want to divide them into credit and debit accounts or list them in alphabetical order if you re creating a trial balance sheet for a business pull up old trial balance sheets to see how accounts were ordered in the past and use the same method if there are multiple accounts of the same type aggregate them for a single account line for example if you had multiple cash accounts you would aggregate them into a single balance sheet line 4 x research source place the account balance in the credit or debit column generally the balances for asset and expense accounts go in the debit column the balances for revenue equity and liability accounts go in the credit column 5 x research source if the account has a negative balance indicate this on your balance sheet by placing a negative sign in front of the number you can also put the number in parentheses however you do not move it to the other column add a total line at the bottom of the columns once you ve entered all the balances in the appropriate columns set up an equation at the bottom to total all the values in the debits column repeat the same process to get the total of all the values in the credits column 6 x research source if the trial balance has been done correctly the debits and credits should be the same however keep in mind that even if they balance there still may be mistakes in the books for example a transaction may have been entered into the wrong account any such mistakes would typically be uncovered and corrected during a routine audit of the books total the balances of all temporary revenue accounts revenue accounts have a credit balance however not all accounts with credit balances are revenue accounts look at the titles of the accounts to determine which accounts to total 7 x research source for example you may have accounts titled service revenue and interest revenue both of these accounts are temporary revenue accounts if there is 36 500 in the service revenue account and 600 in the interest revenue account your total revenue would be 37 100 for the accounting period transfer the total balance of all revenue accounts to income summary create a temporary account called income summary zero out the temporary revenue accounts to close them moving the balance to income summary 8 x research source to return to the previous example if you had 36 500 in service revenue and 600 in interest revenue you would transfer 37 100 to income summary the new balance of both the service revenue account and the interest revenue account would be zero total the balances of all temporary expense accounts expense accounts have debit balances these accounts typically will have names such as rent salaries and utilities 9 x research source for example if you had 20 000 in salaries 1 200 in rent and 500 in utilities your expense total would be 21 700 debit the income summary account for all expenses take your total expenses and subtract them from the total revenue you ve already placed in your income summary the amount left over if any is your income for the accounting period 10 x research source for example if you had 21 700 in expenses and 37 100 in income summary you would end up with 15 400 close income summary to the appropriate capital account move the balance of income summary to capital or retained earnings whichever title is used technically you are debiting the income summary account and crediting the capital account the income summary account balance is now zero 11 x research source if the balance in income summary was negative you would subtract that amount from the capital or retained earnings account debit the capital account for any withdrawals withdrawals from capital may be in a drawing account for partnerships or sole proprietorships or dividends for a corporation any balance in these accounts represents money taken from the business by owners or shareholders 12 x research source for example suppose you have 100 000 in the capital account and a drawing account with 10 000 you would credit the drawing account to zero it out then debit the capital account the resulting balance in the capital account is 90 000 draft a post closing trial balance sheet the post closing trial balance sheet lists the balances of all accounts that weren t zeroed out in closing temporary accounts that were closed such as income summary are not included there are 3 columns 1 for account names 1 for debit balances and 1 for credit balances 13 x research source once you ve copied the account titles place the account balance in the appropriate column asset and expense accounts have debit balances while liability income and equity accounts have credit balances create a total at the bottom of both the debit and the credit columns the totals of the 2 columns should be exactly the

how to create an investment plan,creating a viable investment plan requires a little more than simply establishing a savings account and buying a few random shares of stocks in order to structure a plan that is right it s important to understand where you re at and what you want to accomplish with the investments then you ll define how to reach those goals and select the best investment options to reach them the good news is that it is never too late to create and implement a personal investment plan and begin creating a nest egg for the future,select an age appropriate investment option

downturn or loss of value in a particular investment so if you re in your 20 s you can allocate more of your portfolio to more aggressive investments like growth oriented and small cap companies for example if you re nearing retirement allocate more of your portfolio to less aggressive investments like fixed income and large cap value companies understand your current financial situation be aware of how much disposable income you have available to invest take a look at your budget and determine how much money is left over for investments following your monthly expenses and after you have set

education etc the idea is to let the investment grow over a long period of time so that you have enough to pay for the goal if your goal is particularly aggressive you should put more money in the investment periodically rather than opting for a more risky investment that way you re more likely to achieve your goal rather than lose the money that you ve invested establish a timeline for your goals how soon do you want to reach your financial goals that will determine the type of investments you make if you re interested in getting a great return on your investment quickly and you are prepared to take the risk that you could also see a great loss just as quickly then you ll select more aggressive investments that have the potential for significant return these include undervalued stocks penny stocks and land that might quickly appreciate in value if you re interested in building wealth slowly you ll select investments that generate a slower return on investment over time

research source stocks and mutual funds are very liquid and can be converted into cash usually in a matter of days real estate is not very liquid it usually takes weeks or months to convert a property

bonds and the remaining 40 into a savings account adjust those percentages and investment options so that they re in line with your financial goals ensure that your plan is in line with your risk profile if you put 90 of your disposable income into stocks every month then you re going to lose a lot of money if the stock market crashes that might be a risk that you re willing to take but be sure that s the case consult a financial adviser if you re uncertain about how to set up a plan in line with your goals and your risk profile talk to a qualified financial adviser and get some feedback 6 x research source investigate your options there are many different accounts you might use for an investment plan familiarize yourself with some of the basics and figure out what works for

injury or illness etc this money should easy to access in a hurry consider your options for long term savings if you are thinking about saving up for retirement you may want to set up an ira or 401 k your employer may offer a 401 k plan in which they will match your contribution 7 x research source if you want to start an education fund think about 529 plans and education savings accounts esas earnings from these accounts are free from federal income tax as long as they re used to pay for qualified education expenses 8 x research source monitor your investments from time to time check to see if they re performing according to your goals if not reevaluate your investments and determine where changes need to be made determine if you need to change your risk profile generally speaking as you get older you ll want to take less risk be sure to adjust your investments accordingly if you have money in risky investments it s a good idea to sell them and move the money to more stable investments when you get older if your finances tolerate the volatility of your portfolio very well you might want to take on even more risk so that you can reach your goals sooner evaluate whether or not you re contributing enough to reach your financial goals it may be the case that you re not putting enough money from every paycheck into your investments to make your goals on a more positive note you might find that you re way ahead of reaching your goals and that you re putting too much money into your investments on a regular basis in either case adjust your contributions

how to write a resume for a banking job,just as a good suit should be tailored to fit each person individually a good resume should be tailored to fit the job you want many elements of format style and strategy will vary little if at all from one job to another however you will want to emphasize different skill sets depending upon the job you are applying for in banking you will generally want to emphasize your mathematical abilities attention to detail and interpersonal skills,begin with name and contact information your full name should be centered at the top of the resume in large bold print below it probably in much smaller type you should include any pertinent contact information including phone number email address and home address next include an executive summary an executive summary is a four to six sentence statement at the top of your resume it summarizes your relevant experience and the skills that you can bring to the job avoid generic phrases like detail oriented instead be specific experience with recording transactions and managing the accounts of over a hundred subscribing customers it used to be customary to begin with a two sentence objective statement that explained your career goals this is no longer advisable unless you have no workplace experience in the field in which you are seeking employment even then you should consider whether you can write an executive summary that highlights general transferable skills like management experience and interpersonal skills 1 x research source follow with education the section labeled education should list the institutions you attended the degrees you received your gpa and any awards you won it is not typically necessary to include high school education unless you are just beginning your career or it was the only degree you received 2 x research source if your college gpa is not as high as you would like you can include with it your major specific gpa or junior and senior year gpa if these are much higher it will indicate either that you improved considerably over time or that your general gpa does not adequately convey how adept you are at your specific career move on to work and leadership experience here you should list relevant jobs that you have held along with internships or other unpaid work you do not need to include every job you have ever performed focus on the most relevant experience include the name of your employer when you worked for them and the location of the job 3 x research source after providing this information about the job describe your experience in bullet points when doing so focus on particular accomplishments that demonstrate your ability to meet the qualifications of the job you are applying for use active verbs that convey specific tasks you performed words like wrote organized managed supervised and designed are better than others like obtained achieved or accomplished that don t indicate what skills you employed to reach your goals 4 x research source list skills this can include a combination of hard skills like specific quantitative techniques and computer programming abilities and soft skills which typically refer to your ability to deal with people include explanations that demonstrate that you have been able to exercise these skills in the past stick to standard formatting although it might be tempting to decrease the font size or page margins to fit more onto your resume you should avoid the temptation never reduce the margins below 5 inches and stick to the standard 1 inch margins if possible try to use size 11 font but it is better to reduce the font size than the margins 5 x research source proofread because banking is a detail oriented occupation analysts will quickly recognize formatting or typing errors and judge you harshly for them after completing your resume you should take a day or two before returning to edit it with fresh eyes print it out and find a trusted third party to review it and look for errors 6 x research source emphasize social abilities and salesmanship much of the job of a bank teller consists in interacting with customers in a way that makes them comfortable you will also need to sell services like loans and mortgages for the latter you will need to be able to recognize which customers might require specific services and interact with them so as to encourage them to secure their business 7 x research source to accomplish this you should focus on describing service sector jobs that required extensive customer interaction sales jobs or leadership roles in clubs and organizations emphasize attention to detail and mathematical ability one of the principal jobs of a teller is to count money you will need to demonstrate your capacity to perform basic mathematical processes also you should make it clear that you are attentive enough not to make small errors of calculation tellers are only expected to have a high school degree however you should highlight any academic awards that are suggestive of mathematical ability if any of your prior jobs required the counting of money or other mathematical skills describe these in detail 8 x research source telling your employer that you pay attention to detail will probably not be enough to convince them that it is true instead list instances in which you followed stringent workplace rules precisely proofread text managed large databases or in any other way reviewed the work of a coworker to verify accuracy emphasize computer literacy as a teller you will need to make extensive use of a computer to record transactions your employer should teach you how to use these programs but it is important to prove that you have been able to master other programs in the past 9 x research source to demonstrate computer literacy list any formal credentials you might have earned for specific software programs discuss any programs that you have had to use for other jobs even if they might not seem particularly relevant including word processors and database programs be precise name the specific programs you used and how you used them 10 x research source recognize basic qualifications to break into investment banking you will usually need to demonstrate advanced abilities in some sort of quantitative field of study there are however some exceptions if you have a strong background in public policy or law then an investment bank might find you a useful asset for establishing compliance with government regulation it is preferable that you have a degree in one of the following fields accounting banking business administration business law computer science economics finance human resources information technology or tax law alternatively you might be able to capitalize on past experience in public policy or international relations 11 x research source prove commitment investment bankers spend most of their time and energy working you will need to demonstrate that you have been able to submit yourself to such a rigorous work schedule in the past academics are one of the most important ways to demonstrate commitment most recruits will have at least a 3 5 gpa from a top tier university emphasize major academic achievements and awards having held a leadership role in a campus finance society can also be an important selling point 12 x research source emphasize quantitative results your prospective employer will want to know not only that you have experience in the sector but also that you have accomplished something be specific and list precise numbers as frequently as possible investment banking is detail oriented and mathematical giving exact figures will demonstrate that you are both of those things and prove that you have produced results how many accounts did you manage and what was the volume of the exchanges you made what sort of revenue did you produce 13 x research source stay true to format don t be too creative you should demonstrate that you pay attention to detail and can follow routine format keep your resume to a manageable length with precise and succinct writing your resume should be no more than two pages long to keep it short and attract the reader s eye use bullet points to highlight relevant experience 14 x research source use white paper and conventional fonts 15 x research source be particularly attentive to

how to be a successful business owner,most business owners will tell you that starting a business is both one of the most challenging and most rewarding ways to earn a living being a successful business owner requires a large amount of hard work and dedication but also generally relies on a set of personal qualities and business practices that are common characteristics of successful entrepreneurs these characteristics lie as much in a business s founding principles as in its day to day operations and dictate every decision the entrepreneur makes by following these guidelines you can up your chances of founding a successful business or getting your existing business back on track,do what you know that is you should start a business that focuses on what you have experience in that experience can be either prior work experience or a personal hobby that you re ready to turn into a career even if a business idea seems highly profitable in theory don t start that business unless your heart is in it while profit is important it likely won t keep you coming in early every day and driving growth 1 x research source for example imagine you have experience making coffee as a barista or waiter and want to turn your passion for good coffee into a small business you would already know a good amount about the industry and be able to apply not only your knowledge but your passion to your work start with a well defined purpose while the financial benefits of business ownership can be great most successful business owners don t start with money in mind to get your business off the ground you ll need a clear purpose this purpose should be something more intangible than money like giving back to your community by creating jobs solving a problem that you see in your daily life or pursuing a passion this doesn t mean that you shouldn t also strive for profitability just that your primary goal should be the achievement of a greater purpose 2 x research source for our coffee shop example your purpose would be serving the perfect cup of coffee to every customer alternately it could be to form a community in your coffee shop where people can meet and spend time with friends understand your customer before you get started take some time to do market research and get to know your customers and your industry the u s small business administration provides a great deal of information on which services and products are in demand 3 x trustworthy source u s small business administration u s government agency focused on supporting small businesses go to source you will also want to think about who will be buying your product or using your service and learn the best way to appeal to this population with the coffee shop ask yourself am i trying to appeal to coffee snobs who don t mind waiting five minutes for their pour over or is my focus on the people who are on their way to work and want to grab a cup and run or both understanding the people you plan to serve can help you serve them better find a first step instead of a destination you should always start with a business model that can be up and running quickly on a low budget too many small businesses start with grandiose goals that will require a large amount of startup capital and investors however successful businesses will have a model that can be used on a smaller scale this proves to potential investors that your idea is a valid way of making money and increases your odds of ever getting investment money if that s what you re looking for 4 x research source for example imagine that in our example you want to start a large operation that sources imports roasts and packages its own coffee beans that are then either sold or served to customers at its coffee shops rather than seeking huge contributions from investors to buy all of this equipment you should start with a small coffee shop first then maybe try sourcing and importing beans and work up from there to build a brand create a support network one of the most important parts of successful business ownership is getting over your own ego and seeking help your biggest sources of advice are going to be your group of business associates and other professionals that share your goals surround yourself with knowledgeable and successful people and feed off of their ideas and enthusiasm 5 x research source also seek general small business tips online the web is a goldmine of information just be sure your information is from a reliable source find a mentor a good mentor in this case is someone who has already run or is running a successful business of their own a good example would be a family member or family friend that has been successful in business this mentor can help you with anything from knowing how to manage your employees to properly filing your taxes because their knowledge comes from direct experience they re able to help you more personally than any other source could 6 x research source while your mentor doesn t have to have founded the same type of business you are starting it would help for example another coffee shop founder would be the best source of information in our coffee shop example but a restaurateur could also be of significant help focus only on your primary operations at first that is avoid being caught up in every business opportunity that comes your way it s better to be perfect at one thing than mediocre at five this applies as much to making decisions to diversify your business as it does to deciding to take on additional projects for yourself outside of your primary business focusing on one thing will allow you to commit all of your resources there and be more productive in that endeavor 7 x research source continuing with our example imagine that you see another coffee shop making money by selling customized coffee related merchandise this may make you want to jump into this market as well however doing so before establishing your primary objective making coffee would introduce significant risk and may detract from your ability to focus on coffee quality focus on cash flow not profit while making a profit should certainly be one of your goals it should not be your main focus when you are starting out cash flow is far more important many small businesses run out of money before they have even been around long enough to generate a profit and must close their doors pay careful attention to your overhead costs and sales during the first years and let profit take a backseat 8 x research source keep detailed records in order to be successful you ll have to make a habit of recording each and every expense and revenue that your company has as well as every dollar that flows through it by knowing where exactly your money is coming in and where it s going you re more capable of recognizing financial difficulties before they arise in addition doing this will give you a better idea of where exactly you can make cuts to expenses or increases to revenues 9 x research source for example in our example you would keep detailed records of how much coffee you bought and sold in a given month and what you paid for it this could you help you identify if for example the price of coffee beans was steadily increasing and help you plan whether or not to raise your own prices or consider switching suppliers limit expenses as much as possible while this may seem obvious just try to think of areas where you could generate the same effect by spending less money consider using pre owned equipment finding cheaper forms of advertising for example fliers rather than newspaper ads or negotiating better payment terms with suppliers or customers to save a few dollars here and there 10 x research source try to maintain very low spending habits and only spent money when and where you absolutely have to in our example this could mean starting out with used coffee grinders as long as they still functioned well and trying to get as many supplies as possible from the same supplier cups lids straws etc consider supply chain efficiency your costs and therefore your profits depend on a successful supply chain organization by fostering good relationships with your suppliers organizing deliveries and consistently providing customers with timely service you can increase your profitability and reputation successful supply chain management can also help you eliminate any part of your business with wasted resources like raw materials or labor for example our example coffee shop would want to be on good terms with its coffee bean supplier and have an organized supply chain structure for a number of reasons this is especially crucial for ensuring that you never run out of coffee but could also mean that you could get more consistent deliveries try new types of coffee bean when they become available or negotiate lower prices consider finding strategic partners much like a good mentor a strategic partner can provide you the boost you need to grow your business foster strategic partnerships by reaching out to businesses you think could benefit yours whether they are suppliers technology providers or complementary businesses a good relationship with another company can provide you both free advertising lower your costs of doing business or allow you to expand to new markets depending on the partners you choose 11 x research source for example your coffee shop could benefit from a strategic relationship with a supplier that gives you access to discounts or new products alternately a strategic partner in a complementary business such as a pastry shop could help you both reach new customers and increase your revenues this could be done either through recommending each other or by offering product s from your partner s business and vice versa be responsible when it comes to debt it s very important that you realistically assess your ability to pay back any debt that you take on while starting and running a business is always risk try to minimize your liabilities by only taking out as much as you absolutely need and when you do take on debt be sure to structure your cash flows such that you are paying it off as quickly as possible prioritize debt repayment before you do anything else 12 x research source for example if you took out 20 000 to get your coffee shop started don t think about expanding your product offerings or upgrading your coffee grinders until you ve paid that loan back perfect your business pitch have a 30 second speech ready that explains your business as briefly and efficiently as possible including information about your purpose your service products and your goals having a practiced pitch that you can rattle off to anyone can help you in situations where you re trying to make a sale to a customer as well as it can when you re trying to bring an investor on board 13 x research source if you can t explain your business in this short time your business plan needs refining for your coffee shop you d want to explain what you do sell coffee your services the drinks you offer what makes you special maybe the coffee you serve is rare or locally roasted and what you plan to do next expand to another location new products etc earn a reputation for good service earning a positive reputation is like free advertising your customers will spread the word of your business to friends and come back frequently 14 x research source treat each and every sale like the success or failure of your business depends on it this also means that you should be consistent with every action your business takes and every interaction with customers 15 x research source for your coffee shop this may mean throwing out a burnt batch of coffee so that your customers are always served the absolutely best product you can offer watch your competition closely you should always look to your competitors for ideas especially when you re starting out chances are they re doing something right if you can figure out what that is you can implement it in your own business and avoid the trial and error they probably went through to get there 16 x research source one of the best ways to do this when you re starting out is to examine your competitors pricing strategies in our coffee shop example it would be much simpler to price your coffee similarly to competitors rather than to experiment with different prices on your own always be looking for growth opportunities once you ve gotten established you should always be on the lookout for places you can expand whether that means moving to a larger storefront increasing manufacturing space or opening a new location will depend on your business and goals successful business owners realize that one of the primary opponents to long term growth is remaining stagnant this means taking the risk of expansion rather than resting on your laurels at one original location for our coffee example maybe there is a nearby area that you find is underserved by coffee shops once your primary location is up and running smoothly you should investigate opening a new shop in that area this could also mean moving up from a small stand to a full coffee shop depending on your circumstances diversify your income streams another way to increase the value of your business is by seeking out other areas where you can make money assuming you ve already established your primary business look around and see where you could offer a different service or product maybe your customers frequently visit your store for one item and then immediately go to another store for a different item find out what that other item is and offer it 17 x research source some easy diversification options for your coffee shop would be offering pastries sandwiches or books for purchase,Finance-and-Business

up being your first customers be sure to tell them to spread the word that you do good work when you re finished charge reasonable rates for your work the main reason someone might consider hiring you over a professional service is that you re a lot less expensive ask for a small amount of money that you can live with rather than a large sum a good way to estimate what to ask for is to set a low hourly rate say 8 or 10 also prorate your work to the nearest half hour in other words if you work for 6 hours and 33 minutes just bill for 6 hours and 30 minutes that keeps things simple act professionally dress in clean clothes and smile when people answer their doors offer a handshake when you introduce yourself make eye contact be sure to describe exactly what types of services you

how to conduct a time and motion study,a time and motion study is used to analyze work efficiency through the observation and timing of tasks it can help you see where your day could be more efficient saving you time and and energy which everyone could use you can perform one on yourself or observe another person first you must decide what method you ll use from real time observation to a sampling approach and then you ll observe and time the task after you ve completed the study you can use the data to create a more efficient work process,use work sampling if you have limited time to record in this approach you observe the person at certain times rather than continuously the intervals can be regular or random you observe the person for a given time and then extrapolate from the samples how much time is spent on each task this type works better on tasks that have fewer components or workers that do fewer tasks overall 1 x research source for instance if a person s main job is invoicing random sampling can work because each time you check in you get a snapshot of what the person is doing once you have all the data you can figure out which task or component the person spends the most time on by looking at how often and how long it showed up in each random sample the benefit with this method is you can observe more than one person in a set time period by rotating through each person if you re using this method on yourself set up an alarm to go off at certain intervals so you can record what you re doing for a set amount of time observe the task in real time to be able to ask questions in this approach you are in the room with the person as they do the task observe what they do breaking the task into smaller components as you record times each component should make sense as a whole without getting so detailed that you can t keep up 2 x research source timing a large task isn t helpful without looking at the components of each task if you analyze the components you can look for inefficiencies you won t stop the person you re just breaking down the task for recording purposes for instance if the task is checking the mail the components would include walking to the mail area finding the mail taking it back to the desk opening envelopes reading the mail and discarding or dealing with each letter it can help to have a group for observation that way you can have one person to work the stopwatch 1 person to record times and 1 person to make notes you can also use this approach on yourself in that case you ll be writing down each component as you do it record a video to make the participant perform more naturally instead of observing the tasks in real time take a video that way you can go back later and analyze how long each task takes you won t miss as much because you can always rewind the video to see something again 3 x research source record a video of yourself to perform a more accurate study if you re doing the study on yourself this approach will be much easier than the other 2 set up a camera on a tripod in a place that can capture what you re doing let it record while you go through a set task such as writing a report 4 x research source test the task over a given period for example you may want to test it over a week or even month set up a spreadsheet to record data on you ll need a place to write what the task is and a spreadsheet is ideal next to it you ll need a place for the time often tasks are done in batches if that s the case have a place to record the time for each component of each task you ll just need a set of numbered boxes for this part also add a column for notes for instance if the task is checking email and one of the components is reading email make a record of the time it takes to read each email in the numbered boxes next to the component divide work into small categories part of performing a time and motion study is figuring out exactly how much time is spent on each task generally the only way to improve efficiency is to look at the small actions within each task as the work is being done establish each component of the task and write a short description down the key is finding the right level of detail you don t want to be overly detailed as timing how long it takes to hit a single button isn t useful however you also don t want to be too broad as that won t give you enough data to work on efficiency say you re checking email you might break it down into logging on to the computer and into your email deleting spam mail without opening reading emails composing replies and organizing email into folders time each task start with a stopwatch time each component of the task jotting down the time it took to complete each component it s often easier to just stop and start the timer using the elapsed time you can go in later and figure out how many seconds were spent on each task for more accuracy take data over multiple days time tasks using video when you re using a video you ll need to stop and start the video for each component you re timing that way you ll have time to write down your notes and the times for each component average out the times for each component after you re done take the times for each component and find the average to find an average add all the times for 1 component together and then divide by the number of times in that group for instance if you have reading emails as the component the times might be 65 seconds 210 seconds 240 seconds 39 seconds and 354 seconds add the numbers together 65 210 240 39 354 to equal 908 divide by the number of times in this case that s 5 so divide 908 by 5 to get 181 6 seconds on average per email find the average time for the task the easiest way to find the average time for the whole task is to simply add all the averages for the components together that will give you the average for the whole task assign a high or low value to your tasks assigning a high or low value to each task can help your prioritize what s important you don t have to assign a number just label them as high value or low value for instance answering emails at your job may be important but unless you re in customer service it likely has a lower value overall than finishing an important report 5 x research source cut back on low value high time tasks after you ve rated your tasks look at which tasks take a large amount of time while having a low value overall those are the tasks that you need to figure out how to cut back it s also important to look at the tasks that take a lot of time but also have high value it doesn t hurt to try to make these tasks more efficient 6 x research source watch for multitasking multitasking tends to make each individual task take longer because you can t give either your full attention in cases where you re multitasking such as going back and forth between email and writing a report try changing up set a time period where you are only doing one thing if you re writing a report ignore your email 7 x research source if you read email constantly throughout the day you re constantly pulling your train of thought from whatever else you re doing often it s better to do all of a task at once such as only reading emails in the morning at midday and right before you leave work look for inefficiencies to cut back on them often you ll find inefficiencies in the routines you time and describe eliminating inefficiencies can help you work better and get more done in the time you have for instance if you must file paperwork daily in another room away from your office considering saving it to do all at once if you are constantly going back and forth that takes away time you could be spending on other tasks,Finance-and-Business
how to work out a rental yield,rental yield essentially tells you how much you can expect to earn from an investment property that you re renting out it s typically expressed as a percentage of the cost of the property you can use this figure to determine if a property you re thinking about buying would be a good investment or to understand your return on investment roi in a property you already own this figure is also helpful if you re trying to decide if a buy to let mortgage is affordable for you to work out the rental yield you need to know the total costs of buying and owning the property as well as the amount of rent you ll collect 1 x research source,calculate your yearly mortgage payments if you have a mortgage on the property total the mortgage payments you would make over the course of a year including interest taxes and any associated fees these payments are part of your cost of owning the property 2 x research source even if you don t have a mortgage you re likely still responsible for property taxes on the property those would also be considered part of your costs of ownership if you don t own the property yet use an estimate of mortgage payments or get an offer from a mortgage company for the property and use that number instead get a quote for insurance if you rent out the property you ll typically need landlord insurance which may have different rates than homeowner s insurance if you don t already own the property a quote from a reputable insurer will help you estimate this cost 3 x research source in addition to landlord s insurance you may also want to consider other types of insurance to cover damage to the property rent insurance may also be available to you which provides you some money in the event your tenant breaks their lease or needs to be evicted for nonpayment of rent include any management fees or other property expenses if you ve hired a management company to run the property on your behalf their fees are considered part of your costs you may also have other property expenses or fees depending on where the property is located 4 x research source for example if you only own the building but not the land you may have to pay rent for the land that the property sits on if you have a unit in an apartment building or condominium complex you may also have association fees to consider estimate costs for repairs and maintenance over the course of the year your tenant may have things break that need to be repaired while you can t necessarily predict all of these expenses you can typically come up with a reasonable estimate based on the age of the property and its fixtures 5 x research source you also want to consider major repairs that may be necessary in the event of a natural disaster or other event while your insurance may cover some of this expense you ll likely still have to pay a deductible total your yearly rental income evaluate how much you charge in rent then multiply that amount to get the total rent you ll collect each year if you collect weekly rent multiply the weekly rent amount by 52 for monthly rent multiply by 12 6 x research source for example if you rent the property out for 500 a week you would have an annual rental income of 26 000 find the current value of the property if you plan to purchase the property this year the value of the property would be equal to your purchase price however if you already own the property use the most recent appraisal to determine the current value 7 x research source if you re looking at a property for sale use the asking price as the value of the property even if you think the asking price is too high and plan to make a lower bid on it divide the rental income by the value to find the gross rental yield once you have those two figures complete the equation your result will be a decimal value multiply that number by 100 to get a percentage 8 x research source for example if your yearly rental income is 26 000 and the property is valued at 360 000 you have a gross rental yield of 7 2 gross rental yield is considered ideal if it s somewhere between 7 and 9 so the gross rental yield for that property is good any lower than that and you likely wouldn t have the cash flow in the event emergency repairs were needed start with your total yearly rental income just as when working out gross rental yield you ll need the total rent you collect from the property in a year multiply weekly rent by 52 and monthly rent by 12 to find the annual amount 9 x research source for example if you rented a condominium for 2 000 a month your annual rental income would be 24 000 subtract your annual expenses from the rental income for net rental yield you ll also take into account the other costs of owning the property include all fees mortgage payments interest taxes insurance premiums and other costs associated with the property for the year typically these will be monthly expenses so don t forget to multiply them by 12 to get the annual total 10 x research source for example suppose your annual rental income was 24 000 and the condominium unit cost you 900 a month to maintain your annual cost to own the property would be 10 800 when you subtract 10 800 from 24 000 you get 13 200 divide the result by the current value of the property the current value of the property is not your mortgage payment which likely includes interest taxes and other fees instead look at the value of the most recent appraisal of the property that s the amount you could likely sell the property for 11 x research source for example suppose the condominium you own is worth 250 000 you have an annual rental income of 24 000 for the property which decreased to 13 200 by the costs of owning the property when you divide 13 200 by 250 000 you get 0 0528 multiply by 100 to find your net rental yield net rental yield like gross rental yield is expressed as a percentage of the value of the property to get that percentage take the decimal you got when you divided the annual rental income less costs by the current value of the property and multiply it by 100 12 x research source to continue the example if you had annual rental income less costs of 13 200 divided by 250 000 you would have a net rental yield of 5 28 this is considered a relatively low rental yield but might still be sustainable depending on the location of the property or your reasons for owning it,Finance-and-Business

how to start investing,it is never too soon to start investing investing is the smartest way to secure your financial future and to begin letting your money make more money for you investing is not just for people who have plenty of spare cash on the contrary anyone can and should invest you can get started with just a little bit of money and a lot of know how by formulating a plan and familiarizing yourself with the tools available you can quickly learn how to start investing,make sure you have a safety net holding some money in reserve is a good idea because a if you lose your investment you ll have something to fall back on and b it will allow you to be a bolder investor since you won t be worried about risking every penny you own save between three and six months worth of expenses call it your emergency fund set aside for large unexpected expenses job loss medical expenses auto accident etc this money should be in cash or some other form that s very conservative and immediately available once you have an emergency fund established you can start to save for your long term goals like buying a home retirement and college tuition if your employer offers a retirement plan this is a great vehicle for saving because it can save on your tax bill and your employer may contribute money to match some of your own contributions which amounts to free money for you if you don t have a retirement plan through your workplace most employees are allowed to accumulate tax deferred savings in a traditional ira or a roth ira if you are self employed you have options like a sep ira or a simple ira once you ve determined the type of account s to set up you can then choose specific investments to hold within them get current on all your insurance policies this includes auto health homeowner s renter s disability and life insurance with luck you ll never need insurance but it s nice to have in the event of disaster learn a little bit about stocks this is what most people think of when they consider investing put simply a stock is a share in the ownership of a business a publicly held company the stock itself is a claim on what the company owns its assets and earnings 1 x research source when you buy stock in a company you are making yourself part owner if the company does well the value of the stock will probably go up and the company may pay you a dividend a reward for your investment if the company does poorly however the stock will probably lose value the value of stock comes from public perception of its worth that means the stock price is driven by what people think it s worth and the price at which a stock is purchased or sold is whatever the market will bear even if the underlying value as measured by certain fundamentals might suggest otherwise a stock price goes up when more people want to buy that stock than sell it 2 x research source stock prices go down when more people want to sell than buy in order to sell stock you have to find someone willing to buy at the listed price in order to buy stock you have to find someone selling their stock at a price you like the job of a stockbroker is to pair up buyers and sellers stocks can mean a lot of different things for example penny stocks are stocks that trade at relatively low prices sometimes just pennies various stocks are bundled into what s called an index like the dow jones industrials which is a list of 30 high performing stocks an index is a useful indicator of the performance of the whole market familiarize yourself with bonds bonds are issuances of debt similar to an iou when you buy a bond you re essentially lending someone money 3 x research source the borrower issuer agrees to pay back the money the principal when the life term of the loan has expired the issuer also agrees to pay interest on the principal at a stated rate the interest is the whole point of the investment the term of the bond can range from months to years at the end of which period the borrower pays back the principal in full 4 x research source here s an example you buy a five year municipal bond for 10 000 with an interest rate of 2 35 thus you lend the municipality 10 000 each year the municipality pays you interest on your bond in the amount of of 2 35 of 10 000 or 235 after five years the municipality pays back your 10 000 so you ve made back your principal plus a profit of 1175 in interest 5 x 235 generally the longer the term of the bond the higher the interest rate if you re lending your money for a year you probably won t get a high interest rate because one year is a relatively short period of risk if you re going to lend your money and not expect it back for ten years however you will be compensated for the higher risk you re taking and the interest rate will be higher this illustrates an axiom in investing the higher the risk the higher the return understand the commodities market when you invest in something like a stock or a bond you invest in the business represented by that security the piece of paper you get is worthless but what it promises is valuable a commodity on the other hand is something of inherent value something capable of satisfying a need or desire commodities include pork bellies bacon coffee beans oil natural gas and potash among many other items the commodity itself is valuable because people want and use it people often trade commodities by buying and selling futures a future is simply an agreement to buy or sell a commodity at a certain price sometime in the future 5 x research source futures were originally used as a hedging technique by farmers here s a simple example of how it works farmer joe grows avocados the price of avocados however is typically volatile meaning that it goes up and down a lot at the beginning of the season the wholesale price of avocados is 4 per bushel if farmer joe has a bumper crop of avocados but the price of avocados drops to 2 per bushel in april at harvest farmer joe may lose a lot of money joe in advance of harvest as insurance against such a loss sells a futures contract to someone the contract stipulates that the buyer of the contract agrees to buy all of joe s avocados at 4 per bushel in april now joe has protection against a price drop if the price of avocados goes up he ll be fine because he can sell his avocados at the market price if the price of avocados drops to 2 he can sell his avocados at 4 to the buyer of the contract and make more than other farmers who don t have a similar contract the buyer of a futures contract always hopes that the price of a commodity will go up beyond the futures price he paid that way he can lock in a lower than market price the seller hopes that the price of a commodity will go down he can buy the commodity at low market prices and then sell it to the buyer at a higher than market price know a bit about investing in property investing in real estate can be a risky but lucrative proposition there are lots of ways you can invest in property you can buy a house and become a landlord you pocket the difference between what you pay on the mortgage and what the tenant pays you in rent you can also flip homes that means you buy a home in need of renovations fix it up and sell it as quickly as possible real estate can be a profitable vehicle for some but it is not without substantial risk involving property maintenance and market value other ways of gaining exposure to real estate include collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and collateralized debt obligations cdos which are mortgages that have been bundled into securitized instruments these however are tools for sophisticated investors their transparency and quality can vary greatly as revealed during the 2008 downturn some people think that home values are guaranteed to go up history has shown otherwise real estate values in most areas show very modest rates of return after accounting for costs such as maintenance taxes and insurance as with many investments real estate values do invariably rise if given enough time if your time horizon is short however property ownership is not a guaranteed money maker 6 x research source property acquisition and disposal can be a lengthy and unpredictable process and should be viewed as a long term higher risk proposition it is not the type of investment that is appropriate if your time horizon is short and is certainly not a guaranteed investment learn about mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs mutual funds and etfs are similar investment vehicles in that each is a collection of many stocks and or bonds hundreds or thousands in some cases holding an individual security is a concentrated way of investing the potential for gain or loss is tied to a single company whereas holding a fund is a way to spread the risk across many companies sectors or regions doing so can dampen the upside potential but also serves to protect against the downside risk commodities exposure is usually achieved by holding futures contracts or a fund of futures contracts real estate can be held directly by owning a home or investment property or in a real estate investment trust reit or reit fund which holds interests in a number of residential or commercial properties buy undervalued assets buy low sell high if you re talking about stocks and other assets you want to buy when the price is low and sell when the price is high if you buy 100 shares of stock on january 1st for 5 per share and you sell those same shares on december 31st for 7 25 you just made 225 that may seem a paltry sum but when you re talking about buying and selling hundreds or even thousands of shares it can really add up how do you tell if a stock is undervalued you need to look at a company closely its earnings growth profit margins its p e ratio and its dividend yield instead of looking at just one aspect and making a decision based on a single ratio or a momentary drop in the stock s price the price to earnings ratio is a common way of determining if a stock is undervalued it simply divides a company s share price by its earnings for example if company x is trading at 5 per share with earnings of 1 per share its price to earnings ratio is 5 that is to say the company is trading at five times its earnings the lower this figure the more undervalued the company may be typical p e ratios range between 15 and 20 although ratios outside that range are not uncommon use p e ratios as only one of many indications of a stock s worth always compare a company to its peers for example assume you want to buy company x you can look at company x s projected earnings growth profit margins and price to earnings ratio you would then compare these figures to those of company x s closest competitors if company x has better profit margins better projected earnings and a lower price to earnings ratio it may be a better buy ask yourself some basic questions what will the market be for this stock in the future will it look bleaker or better what competitors does this company have and what are their prospects how will this company be able to earn money in the future 7 x research source these should help you come to a better understanding of whether a company s stock is under or over valued invest in companies that you understand perhaps you have some basic knowledge regarding some business or industry why not put that to use invest in companies or industries that you know because you re more likely to understand revenue models and prospects for future success of course never put all your eggs in one basket investing in only one or a very few companies can be quite risky however wringing value out of a single industry whose workings you understand will increase your chances of being successful for example you may hear plenty of positive news on a new technology stock it is important to stay away until you understand the industry and how it works the principle of investing in companies you understand was popularized by renowned investor warren buffett who made billions of dollars sticking only with business models he understood and avoiding ones he did not avoid buying on hope and selling on fear it s very easy and too tempting to follow the crowd when investing we often get caught up in what other people are doing and take it for granted that they know what they re talking about then we buy stocks just because other people buy them or sell them when other people do doing this is easy unfortunately it s a good way to lose money invest in companies that you know and believe in and tune out the hype and you ll be fine when you buy a stock that everyone else has bought you re buying something that s probably worth less than its price which has probably risen in response to the recent demand when the market corrects itself drops you could end up buying high and then selling low just the opposite of what you want to do hoping that a stock will go up just because everyone else thinks it will is foolish when you sell a stock that everyone else is selling you re selling something that may be worth more than its price which likely has dropped because of all the selling when the market corrects itself rises you ve sold low and will have to buy high if you decide you want the stock back fear of losses can prove to be a poor reason to dump a stock if you sell based on fear you may protect yourself from further declines but you may also miss out on a rebound just as you did not anticipate the decline you will not be able to predict the rebound stocks have historically risen over long time frames which is why holding on to them and not over reacting to short term swings is important know the effect of interest rates on bonds bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship when interest rates go up bond prices go down when interest rates go down bond prices go up here s why interest rates on bonds normally reflect the prevailing market interest rate say you buy a bond with an interest rate of 3 if interest rates on other investments then go up to 4 and you re stuck with a bond paying 3 not many people would be willing to buy your bond from you when they can buy another bond that pays them 4 interest for this reason you would have to lower the price of your bond in order to sell it the opposite situation applies when bond market rates are falling diversify diversifying your portfolio is one of the most important things that you can do because it diminishes your risk think of it this way if you were to invest 5 in each of 20 different companies all of the companies would have to go out of business before you would lose all your money if you invested the same 100 in just one company only that company would have to fail for all your money to disappear thus diversified investments hedge against each other and keep you from losing lots of money because of the poor performance of a few companies diversify your portfolio not only with a good mix of stocks and bonds but go further by buying shares in companies of different sizes in different industries and in different countries often when one class of investment performs poorly another class performs nicely it is very rare to see all asset classes declining at the same time many believe a balanced or moderate portfolio is one made up of 60 stocks and 40 bonds thus a more aggressive portfolio might have 80 stocks and 20 bonds and a more conservative portfolio might have 70 bonds and 30 stocks some advisors will tell you that your portfolio s percentage of bonds should roughly match your age invest for the long run 8 x research source choosing good quality investments can take time and effort not everyone can do the research and keep up with the dynamics of all the companies being considered many people instead employ a buy and hold approach of weathering the storms rather than attempting to predict and avoid market downturns this approach works for most in the long term but requires patience and discipline there are some however who choose to try their hand at being a day trader which involves holding stocks for a very short time hours even minutes doing so however does not often lead to success over the long term for the following reasons brokerage fees add up every time you buy or sell a stock a middleman known as a broker takes a cut for connecting you with another trader these fees can really add up if you re making a lot of trades every day cutting into your profit and magnifying your losses many try to predict what the market will do and some will get lucky on occasion by making some good calls and will claim it wasn t luck but research shows that this tactic does not typically succeed over the long term the stock market rises over the long term from 1871 to 2014 the s p 500 s compound annual growth rate was 9 77 a rate of return many investors would find attractive the challenge is to stay invested long term while weathering the ups and downs in order to achieve this average the standard deviation for this period was 19 60 which means some years saw returns as high as 29 37 while other years experienced losses as large as 9 83 9 x research source set your sights on the long term not the short if you re worried about all the dips along the way find a graphical representation of the stock market over the years and hang it somewhere you can see whenever the market is undergoing its inevitable and temporary declines consider whether or not to short sell this can be a hedging strategy but it can also amplify your risk so it s really suitable only for experienced investors the basic concept is as follows instead of betting that the price of a security is going to increase shorting is a bet that the price will drop when you short a stock or bond or currency your broker actually lends you shares without your having to pay for them then you hope the stock s price goes down if it does you cover meaning you buy the actual shares at the current lower price and give them to the broker the difference between the amount credited to you in the beginning and the amount you pay at the end is your profit short selling can be dangerous however because it s not easy to predict a drop in price if you use shorting for the purpose of speculation be prepared to get burned sometimes if the stock s price were to go up instead of down you would be forced to buy the stock at a higher price than what was credited to you initially if on the other hand you use shorting as a way to hedge your losses it can actually be a good form of insurance this is an advanced investment strategy and you should generally avoid it unless you are an experienced investor with extensive knowledge of markets remember that while a stock can only drop to zero it can rise indefinitely meaning that you could lose enormous sums of money through short selling choose where to open your account there are different options available you can go to a brokerage firm sometimes also called a wirehouse or custodian such as fidelity charles schwab or td ameritrade you can open an account on the website of one of these institutions or visit a local branch and choose to direct the investments on your own or pay to work with a staff advisor you can also go directly to a fund company such as vanguard fidelity or t rowe price and let them be your broker they will offer you their own funds of course but many fund companies such as the three just named offer platforms on which you can buy the funds of other companies too see below for additional options in finding an advisor always be mindful of fees and minimum investment rules before opening an account brokers all charge fees per trade ranging from 4 95 to 10 generally and many require a minimum initial investment ranging from 500 to much higher

investment some advisors like certified financial planners have the ability to give advice in a number of areas such as investments taxes and retirement planning while others can only act on a client

starting to work with someone ask about their training and expertise to make sure they are the right fit for you invest in a roth ira as soon in your working career as possible if you re earning

contributions so the employee should contribute at least enough to trigger the employer match consider investing mainly in stocks but also in bonds to diversify your portfolio from 1925 to 2011 stocks outperformed bonds in every rolling 25 year period while this may sound appealing from a return standpoint it entails volatility which can be worrisome add less volatile bonds to your portfolio for the sake of stability and diversification the older you get the more appropriate it becomes to own bonds a more conservative investment re read the above discussion of diversification start off investing a little money in mutual funds an index fund is a mutual fund that invests in a specific list of companies of a particular size or economic sector such a fund performs similarly to its index such as the s p 500 index or the barclays aggregate bond index mutual funds come in different shapes and sizes some are actively managed meaning there is a team of analysts and other experts employed by the fund company to research and understand a particular geographical region or economic sector because of this professional management such funds generally cost more than index funds which simply mimic an index and don t need much management they can be bond heavy stock heavy or invest in stocks and bonds equally they can buy and sell their securities actively or they can be more passively managed as in the case of index funds mutual funds come with fees there may be charges or loads when you buy or sell shares of the fund the fund s expense ratio is expressed as a percentage of total assets and pays for overhead and management expenses some funds charge a lower percentage fee for larger investments expense ratios generally range from as low as 0 15 or 15 basis points abbreviated bps for index funds to as high as 2 200 bps for actively managed funds there may also be a 12b 1 fee charged to offset a fund s marketing expenses the u s securities and exchange commission states that no evidence exists that higher fee mutual funds produce better returns than do lower fee funds in other words deal with lower fee funds mutual funds can be purchased through nearly any brokerage service even better is to purchase directly from a mutual fund company this avoids brokerage fees call or write the fund company or visit their website opening a fund account is simple and easy see invest in mutual funds consider exchange traded funds in addition to or instead of mutual funds exchange traded funds etfs are very similar to mutual funds in that they pool people s money and buy many investments there are a few key differences 12 x research source etfs can be traded on an exchange throughout the business day just like stocks whereas mutual funds are bought and sold only at the end of each trading day etfs are typically index funds and do not generate as much in the way of taxable capital gains to pass on to investors as compared with actively managed funds etfs and mutual funds are becoming less distinct from each other and investors need not own both types of investment if you like the idea of buying and selling fund shares during rather than at the end of the trading day etfs are a good choice for you consider using the services of a financial planner or advisor many planners and advisors require that their clients have an investment portfolio of at least a minimum value sometimes 100 000 or more this means it could be hard to find an advisor willing to work with you if your portfolio isn t well established in that case look for an advisor interested in helping smaller investors how do financial planners help planners are professionals whose job is to invest your money for you ensure that your money is safe and guide you in your financial decisions they draw from a wealth of experience at allocating resources most importantly they have a financial stake in your success the more money you make under their tutelage the more money they make buck the herd instinct the herd instinct alluded to earlier is the idea that just because a lot of other people are doing something you should too 13 x research source many successful investors have made moves that the majority thought were unwise at the time that doesn t mean however that you should never seek investment advice from other people just be wise about choosing the people you listen to friends or family members with a successful background in investing can offer worthwhile advice as can professional advisors who charge a flat fee rather than a commission for their help invest in smart opportunities when other people are scared in 2008 as the housing crisis hit the stock market shed thousands of points in a matter of months a smart investor who bought stocks as the market bottomed out enjoyed a strong return when stocks rebounded this reminds us to buy low and sell high it takes courage to buy investments when they are becoming cheaper in a falling market and sell those investments when they are looking better and better a rising market it seems counter intuitive but it s how the world s most successful investors made their money know the players in the game 14 x research source which institutional investors think that your stock is going to drop in price and have therefore shorted it what mutual fund managers have your stock in their fund and what is their track record while it helps to be independent as an investor it s also helpful to know what respected professionals are doing there are websites which compile recent opinions on a stock from analysts and expert investors for example if you are considering a purchase of tesla shares you can search tesla on stockchase it will give you all the recent expert opinions on the stock re examine your investment goals and strategies every so often your life and conditions in the market change all the time so your investment strategy should change with them never be so committed to a stock or

how to do technical analysis,technical analysis evolved from the stock market theories of charles henry dow founder of the wall street journal and co founder of dow jones and company the goal of technical analysis is to predict the future price of stocks commodities futures and other tradeable securities based on past prices and performance of those securities technical analysts apply the law of supply and demand to understand how the stock market and other securities exchanges work identifying trends and profiting from them the following steps will help you understand technical analysis and how it is applied to choosing stocks and other commodities,understand dow s theories behind technical analysis three of dow s theories about investments form the underpinnings of technical analysis and serve to guide the technical analyst s approach to financial markets those theories are described below with an explanation of how technical analysts interpret them 1 x research source market fluctuations reflect all known information technical analysts believe that changes in the price of a security and how well it trades in the market reflect all the available information about that security as garnered from all pertinent sources price listings are therefore thought of as fair value sudden changes in how a stock trades often precedes major news about the company that issued the stock technical analysts don t concern themselves with the price to earnings ratio shareholder equity return on equity or other factors that fundamental analysts consider price movements can often be charted and predicted technical analysts acknowledge that there are periods when prices move randomly but there are also times when they move in an identifiable trend 2 x research source once a trend is identified it is possible to make money from it either by buying low and selling high during an upward trend bull market or by selling short during a downward trend bear market by adjusting the length of time the market is being analyzed it is possible to spot both short and long term trends history repeats itself people don t change their motivations overnight traders can be expected to react the same way to current conditions as they did in the past when those same conditions occurred because people react predictably technical analysts can use their knowledge of how other traders reacted in the past to profit each time conditions repeat themselves in this respect technical analysis differs from efficient market theory which ignores the effect that human actions and reactions have on the market look for quick results unlike fundamental analysis which looks at balance sheets and other financial data over relatively long periods of time technical analysis focuses on periods no longer than a month and sometimes as short as a few minutes it is suited to people who seek to make money from securities by repeatedly buying and selling them rather than those who invest for the long term read charts to spot price trends technical analysts look at charts and graphs of security prices to spot the general direction in which prices are headed overlooking individual fluctuations trends are classified by type and duration 3 x research source up trends characterized by highs and lows that become progressively higher down trends are seen when successive highs and lows are progressively lower horizontal trends in which successive highs and lows fail to change much from previous highs and lows trend lines are drawn to connect successive highs to each other and successive lows to each other this makes spotting trends easy such trend lines are often called channel lines trends are classified as major trends when they last longer than a year as intermediate trends when they last at least a month but less than a year and as near term trends when they last less than a month intermediate trends are made up of near term trends and major trends are made up of near term and intermediate trends which may not go in the same direction as the larger trend they are part of an example of this would be a month long downward price correction in a year long bull market the bull market is a major trend while the price correction is an intermediate trend within it 4 x research source technical analysts use four kinds of charts they use line charts to plot closing stock prices over a period of time bar and candlestick charts to show the high and low prices for the trading period and gaps between trading periods if there are any and point and figure charts to show significant price movements over a period of time technical analysts have coined certain phrases for patterns that appear on the charts they analyze a pattern resembling a head and shoulders indicates that a trend is about to reverse itself a pattern resembling a cup and handle indicates that an upward trend will continue after pausing for a short downward correction a rounding bottom or saucer bottom pattern indicates a long term bottoming out of a downward trend before an upswing a double top or double bottom pattern indicates two failed attempts to exceed a high or low price which will be followed by a reversal of the trend similarly a triple top or bottom shows three failed attempts that precede a trend reversal other patterns include triangles wedges pennants and flags 5 x research source understand the concepts of support and resistance support refers to the lowest price a security reaches before more buyers come in and drive the price up resistance refers to the highest price a security reaches before owners sell their shares and cause the price to fall again these levels are not fixed but fluctuate on a chart depicting channel lines the bottom line is the support line floor price for the security while the top line is the resistance line ceiling price support and resistance levels are used to confirm the existence of a trend and to identify when the trend reverses itself 6 x research source because people tend to think in round numbers 10 20 25 50 100 500 1 000 and so on support and resistance prices are often given in round numbers it is possible for stock prices to rise above resistance levels or fall below support levels in such cases the resistance level may become a support level for a new higher resistance level or the support level may become a resistance level for a new lower support level for this to happen the price has to make a strong sustained change such reversals may be common in the short term generally when securities are trading near a support level technical analysts tend to avoid buying because of concern for price volatility they may however buy within a few points of that level those who sell short use the support price as their trading point pay attention to the volume of trades how much buying and selling goes on indicates the validity of a trend or whether it s reversing itself if the trading volume increases substantially even as the price rises substantially the trend is probably valid if the trading volume increases only slightly or even falls as the price goes up the trend is probably due to reverse itself use moving averages to filter out minor price fluctuations a moving average is a series of calculated averages measured over successive equal periods of time moving averages remove unrepresentative highs and lows making it easier to see overall trends plotting prices against moving averages or short term averages against long term averages makes it easier to spot trend reversals there are several averaging methods used 7 x research source the simple moving average sma is found by adding together all the closing prices during the time period and dividing that sum by the number of prices included the linear weighted average takes each price and multiplies it by its position on the chart before adding the prices together and dividing by the number of prices thus over a five day period the first price would be multiplied by 1 the second by 2 the third by 3 the fourth by 4 and the fifth by 5 an exponential moving average ema is similar to the linear moving average except that it weighs only the most recent prices used in computing the average making it more responsive to the latest information than a simple moving average use indicators and oscillators to support what the price movements are telling you indicators are calculations that support the trend information gleaned from price movements and add another factor into your decision to buy or sell securities the moving averages described above are an example of an indicator some indicators can have any value while others are restricted to a particular range of values such as 0 to 100 the latter indicators are termed oscillators indicators may be either leading or lagging leading indicators predict price movements and are most useful during horizontal trends to signal uptrends or downtrends lagging indicators confirm price movements and are most useful during uptrends and downtrends trend indicators include the average directional index adx and the aroon indicator the adx uses positive and negative directional indicators to determine how strong an uptrend or downtrend is on a scale of 0 to 100 values below 20 indicate a weak trend and over 40 a strong one the aroon indicator plots the lengths of time since the highest and lowest trading prices were reached using that data to determine the nature and strength of the trend or the onset of a new trend the best known volume indicator is the moving average convergence divergence macd indicator it is the difference between two exponential moving averages one short term and the other long term as plotted against a center line that represents where the two averages equal each other a positive macd value shows that the short term average is above the long term average and the market should move upward a negative macd value shows that the short term average is below the long term average and that the market is moving downward when the macd is plotted on a chart and its line crosses the centerline it shows when the moving averages that make it up cross over another volume related indicator the on balance volume obv indicator is the total trading volume for a given period a positive number when the price is up and a negative number when the price is down unlike the macd the actual value of the number has less meaning than whether the number is positive or negative how frequently securities are being traded is tracked by both the relative strength index rsi and the stochastic oscillator the rsi ranges from 0 to 100 a value over 70 suggests that the security being evaluated is being bought too frequently while a value under 30 suggests it is being sold too frequently rsi is normally used for 14 day periods but may be used for shorter periods making it more volatile the stochastic oscillator also runs from 0 to 100 it signals too frequent buying at values over 80 and too frequent selling at values under 20,Finance-and-Business

how to calculate accident incident rate,the occupational safety and health administration osha is a regulatory agency of the federal government that ensures as much as possible that american workers operate in a safe working environment 1 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source the organization requires certain businesses to report their statistics concerning accidents injuries and other incidents that occur while on the job accidents and incidents are logged on an osha 300 form that is usually tracked on a spreadsheet,count the number of employees in your company if your company had 10 or fewer employees at all times during the previous calendar year then you do not need to report incidents to osha 2 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source determine your industry every business is part of a particular industry or sector before you can determine whether or not you need to report incidents to osha you need to understand what industry you re part of industries are usually defined by broad categories like construction it services food service etc pick a keyword or two that best describes your business you ll need that for the next step get the naics for your business the naics is the north american industry classification it s a 6 digit code that s used to classify a business the federal government uses the code to maintain statistics about the types of businesses that exist in the united states visit the naics search site enter a keyword that describes your business in the field in the upper right hand corner of the screen just above the button that reads 2007 naics search osha still classifies industries based on the older naics codes so you ll need to use that search instead of the newer 2012 search 3 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source click the 2007 naics search button the new page that appears will be a list of naics codes and businesses select the naics code that best describes your business for example if your business is a restaurant and you put restaurant in the search field you ll see a variety of codes with descriptions that include the word restaurant however the code 722110 is used to classify full service restaurants 4 x research source determine if your business must report incidents to osha using the naics visit osha s website to get the list of exempt types of business based on the naics 5 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source for this step you ll only need the first four digits of your naics for example if your naics is 722110 you only need the 7221 portion of the code the osha website lists exempt industries by naics sorted in ascending numerical order just scroll down until you see where your industry code would be located if it s there then your business is exempt in this case you can see that 7221 is listed and therefore full service restaurants do not need to report incidents to osha 6 x trustworthy source us occupational safety and health administration u s government agency responsible for setting and enforcing workplace safety standards go to source keep in mind you will still need to report incidents to osha if you re requested to do so by osha the bureau of labor statistics or any other government organization operating under the authority of osha understand the formula for calculating accidents the formula for calculating incidents is the number of recorded accidents in that year multiplied by 200 000 to standardize the accident rate for 100 employees and then divided by the number of employee labor hours worked so the formula again is accident rate number of accidents 200 000 number of hours worked the 200 000 in this formula represents how many hours would be worked by 100 employees each putting in 40 hours per week over 50 weeks in a year osha requires the accident rate to be expressed as incidents per 100 employees with maximum straight time hours pull the number of accidents and recordable incidents from the osha 300 log the osha 300 log is what you use to record workplace injuries 7 x research source in that log is a table where you record incidents simply count the number of lines that you ve filled out in that table to determine the number of recordable incidents remember the rate is calculated on an annual basis for osha compliance so you ll be reviewing data from the previous year to get the rate total the number of hours worked by all employees during the year in question you ll need to pull some payroll data for this step for example if you have 20 employees and they each worked 2 000 hours during the year then the total number of hours worked is 20 x 2 000 or 40 000 the total number of hours will include overtime hours but does not include vacation paid sick leave or holiday pay multiply the number of recordable incidents by 200 000 for example if you recorded 2 incidents then the number is 2 200 000 or 400 000 divide by the result by the total number of hours worked take the number from step 3 and divide it by the number from step 2 for example if you had 1 recordable incident out of 10 000 hours worked in a year your calculation would be 1 200 000 10 000 prepare the monthly average incident rate many businesses like to track the incident rate as a monthly figure to assist them in meeting annual and quarterly goals adjust your calculation for each month to reflect the hours worked by all employees for only that month add the incidents and hours worked from each month and then calculate the incident rate on the totals for instance if you had 1 january incident over 10 000 hours worked then your january average incident rate would be 1 200 000 10 000 or 20 for another example if you had eight accidents over 400 000 hours worked by employees in a year you would calculate the accident rate as 8 200 000 400 000 or 4,Finance-and-Business
how to set up a fundraising event,whether you want to get involved in activism or you need to raise money for a cause close to you a fundraising event is a fun and effective way to do it choose a cause and an event type then find somewhere to hold the event schedule the event and organize all the necessary supplies services and staff so you have the logistics taken care of market the fundraiser and sell tickets to get people to actually come on the day of the event make sure to set up for the fundraiser well in advance to ensure it runs smoothly soon enough you ll be raising money for something important to you and helping out others,define the cause of your fundraising event choose a cause or issue that is important to you if you want to raise money for a charitable cause write down the reasons you want to raise money if it s a personal cause such as raising money for your sports team 1 x research source for example you could choose to raise money for the fight against cancer the humanitarian crisis in sudan or the battle against wildfires in australia pick just one important issue at a time to fundraise for to avoid getting overwhelmed if you aren t sure what you want to raise money for but you know you want to get involved with fundraising try talking to organizations in your community homeless shelters veterans organizations schools and libraries often need funding and you ll make a real impact right there in your own community set your fundraising goal determine the amount of money you want to net which is the amount of money you are left with after you subtract expenses by calculating how much you need or want to raise for the cause having this number to work towards will help you plan the rest of the event 2 x research source for example if you are raising money to combat wildfires in australia you could set a net goal of 10 000 to donate to charities that help that cause this means that you want to raise 10 000 for the cause plus enough to cover the expenses of the fundraising event if you are raising money for something like a sports team you can calculate how much money you need for things like new equipment or travel expenses to help you set your goal if you need 1 000 for new jerseys and 4 000 to travel to a tournament you would set a net goal of 5 000 it s best to be completely transparent with your donors and supporters about where the money you are raising will go choose a target audience based on who you think cares about your cause think about the purpose of your fundraising event and decide if it will be geared towards a general audience or if it will target a more specific audience such as friends and family of your sports team members business people or parents this will help you choose the type of event and determine who and how many people to invite 3 x research source for example a big charitable cause like raising money for children in sudan can have a large more general target audience because it is a world issue rather than a local one if you are raising money for a more personal cause like a pet s veterinarian bills it would make more sense to limit the audience to family friends and close members of the immediate community who the cause is more relevant to create a budget make a list of all the things you know you will need to spend money on for the event include things like staff event space food and drinks invitations guest speakers or entertainers and any other items or services that will cost money 4 x research source if you don t know the exact price of everything you will need to pay for just yet that s ok you can make a spreadsheet with all the expenses listed then fill it in with the estimated costs of each item as you continue planning you may be able to get services items and even event space donated by local businesses or organizations explain to them that you are hosting a fundraising event for your charity and that they can help a worthy cause and get exposure for their business by donating to your event 5 x research source select what type of event to hold based on your audience and budget choose to hold something traditional like a car wash a silent auction or a dinner if you aren t feeling too creative try something different like a race a water fight or a dodgeball tournament if you want to do something more unique and fun 6 x research source for example if you re running a fundraiser to benefit your school s band you could set up a school bake sale or carnival make sure the event is an experience that is fun to participate in you could have guest speakers a band activities after dinner or anything else you can come up with that will keep guests entertained and engaged get creative when you re brainstorming ideas for the event you can choose between service based events like car washes and competition based events like sports tournaments find a place to hold the event look for large indoor event spaces like schools wineries restaurants or conference centers if your event will be held inside search for outdoor spaces like parks or sporting fields if you are hosting an outdoor event 7 x research source you could try to find out where other similar events have been held and ask about the availability of those places schedule a date and time make sure the space you want to throw the fundraiser in is available on the day and time you want and reserve it leave enough time between now and the date of the event for invitees to respond if applicable 8 x research source don t schedule your event on the same days as major holidays or other big events to avoid conflicts and maximize the number of attendees tour the chosen location s facilities to plan for the event setup make sure there is adequate space and find out what supplies are available to use if any make a map of the space and draw in where different things will go on the day of the event 9 x research source for example if you are hosting a fundraiser at an event space like a conference center they probably have things like microphones sound systems and other electronics available to borrow or rent if you re hosting an outdoor fundraiser make sure you plan out where things like parking and concession booths will be notify the proper authorities and complete any required paperwork research online or talk to other people who have hosted fundraisers in your area to find out what permits are necessary fill out any required paperwork and pay any fees to ensure your event is legal and avoid any fines or other problems 10 x research source for example if you are holding a raffle you may need to speak with the gaming authority if you re selling food you may need to check with the health department purchase all the necessary supplies refer to your list of items that you made for your budget purchase as many supplies as you can ahead of time and make sure you know where to get anything else you need to purchase right before the event 11 x research source for example for a silent auction you will need things like tables clipboards paper pens and donated goods and services to auction off if you are having a meal at your event you ll need things like food drinks glasses plates and cutlery book any services you need for the event hire any staff you need such as security or wait staff schedule food service entertainment and anything else you need for the fundraiser 12 x research source for example if you want to have live entertainment at the event book a band in advance if you want to tightly control entry hire a security guard to attend the front door if you are serving food reserve a team of caterers to supply the food and serve guests assemble a team of volunteers to work the event talk to friends family people you know who support your cause and ask them if they are willing to help out with your fundraiser gather enough volunteers to help you with pre event activities as well as help run the event itself 13 x research source the number of volunteers you need depends on how big the event is you can make a list of all the different roles and responsibilities you want help with to decide how many volunteers you need delegate leadership tasks and other responsibilities to your event team once you have a team assembled assign tasks to your team members and make sure everyone understands their particular job or task encourage team members to ask questions if they re unclear about their assignment or responsibilities 14 x research source for example if you re holding a silent auction you might need 1 2 people to help you out with marketing and ticket sales before the event then you might need 1 person to receive donations and handle money on the day of the event 1 person to direct guests in the parking lot and 1 person to usher guests to their seats promote the fundraising event online use social media email and possibly a website to market the event create pages for the event on facebook and instagram to advertise it 15 x research source if you re just doing a one off fundraiser it might not make sense to go to the effort of creating a website for the event however if you see yourself throwing more it s worth it to spend the time and effort on creating at least a basic website that you can use as a landing page with information about the event do email blasts to all your contacts create several emails including an initial announcement and 2 3 follow up emails advertising the event that include links to all the event s social media channels and information about how to buy tickets donate and attend send these emails to all your personal contacts 16 x research source you can also ask your friends family and supporters to forward or send each

product if your ads are primarily reaching adults who don t generally carry backpacks this would be an issue to raise in your evaluation display marketing conversion data this figure represents how many potential customers or visitors to your website actually purchased a product this can be evaluated with site traffic counters if this number is particularly low you should offer explanations as

websites the ease of purchase or the price of your product admit any data collection difficulties or incomplete sections your executive summary should also include a section where you explain whether or not you had any difficulty attaining the data within this could help explain incomplete or omitted sections or topics sometimes there s no way to obtain a certain set of data reliably if this is

to pay your own bills avoid payday loans while they may seem like a good solution if you re strapped for cash the interest rates are ridiculously high so they will only get you further into debt understand how much it will really cost before you take out any kind of loan or finance any purchase be sure to calculate what your monthly payments will be how long it will take you to repay the debt and how much you will be paying in interest in some cases paying interest may be worth it for example most people cannot afford to purchase a house without taking out a mortgage but depending on the price of the house and the average cost of rent in your area you might still be saving a significant amount of money by choosing to buy with a mortgage instead of renting be especially wary of high interest rates for depreciating assets like vehicles if you decide to sell your vehicle after you have owned it for several years it may be worth less than what you owe on it this can also happen with real estate when the market conditions are poor always read the fine print for credit cards your interest rate may increase after a certain amount of time avoid impulse buys if you always have a plan for what you will buy you will have a much easier time managing your finances if you have a hard time controlling your purchases when you go to the mall try to avoid going to the mall at all write out

a harder time keeping track of your expenses and sticking to your budget when you use a credit card stop using it paying with cash instead of a credit card will allow you to visualize how much of your available funds you are spending on a given purchase if you are able to stick to your budget when using a credit card look for one that has no annual fee and will reward you with cash back or other incentives just make sure you always pay your bill on time or these incentives will not be worth the price you are paying in interest assess your daily or weekly spending habits once you have a solid grasp on what you are spending your money on you can start cutting out expensive habits smoking is an extremely expensive habit that can also lead to expensive medical bills so do whatever you can to quit buying coffee every day instead of making it yourself can really add up if you don t like plain coffee try searching online for recipes that are similar to the specialty coffee drinks you like to buy buying bottled water or other drinks is extremely expensive compared to refilling a reusable water bottle with tap water throughout the day buying lunch five days a week instead of bringing leftovers to work with you can be a real budget killer if you can t commit to bringing lunch every day start by bringing lunch a few times a week playing the lottery on a regular basis is probably not a wise use of your money if your budget is tight buy used items you can save on everything from your next car to furnishings for your home by buying gently used items you can sometimes find really great clothes that have barely been worn at thrift shops for a fraction of the price don t forget about looking for electronics that have been refurbished by the manufacturer if you are crafty buy solid but ugly furniture at a yard sale or flea market and freshen it up with paint instead of splurging on a new piece look for monthly expenses that can be cut if you pay for monthly memberships or subscriptions carefully assess how much they cost how much you use them and whether you could give them up make sure you re not paying for services that you never use for example if you have premium cable channels that you never watch you can cancel them without feeling like you are making any sacrifices the same goes for your cell phone bill if you are paying for more data than you ever use if you belong to a warehouse club try to calculate how much you save on products by shopping there in order to determine if the membership cost is worth it look for less expensive alternatives if you do use the services for example if you go to the gym regularly you probably shouldn t stop exercising to save a few bucks but you may be able to find a cheaper gym to go to or even a less expensive membership option at the same gym compare items or brands when shopping if you re on a tight budget you want to make sure you re always getting the best deal on absolutely everything take some time to compare prices for items you purchase regularly and for large purchases if you ve had the same auto insurance carrier or cable company for a long time there might be better deals out there so be sure to comparison shop regularly shopping for necessities online can be cheaper in some instances but make sure you take shipping charges into account use coupons to save some extra cash keep in mind that many retailers accept competitors coupons be careful about driving long distances to save a small amount of money you might end up spending more on gas to get there than you actually saved watch out for deals on items you weren t planning on buying in the first place even if the price is great you will save more by not buying it at all ask for a better deal you can always ask your service providers for better deals especially if you ve been a loyal customer the worst they can say is no try this with your cable and internet providers insurance companies and cell phone carriers spend

month and 360 days to a year others may use the actual number of days in a month and year to calculate your accrued interest you must first know which of these methods is used for your bond and then do a few simple calculations,determine the day count convention on your bond the day count convention dcc determines how the day count fraction dcf is found when calculating accrued interest the day count convention on your bond is defined in the accompanying indenture contract 1 x research source for example 30 days in a month and 360 days in a year would mean a dcc of 30 360 other bonds especially u s government treasury bonds calculate interest using the exact number of days in a month and year such a dcc is sometimes referred to as actual actual or act act in practice bonds can also use a combination of these two dccs with such possible dccs as 30 act and act 360 in practical terms the convention used will make very little difference in terms of interest earned double check your bond indenture to be sure 2 x research source confirm the interest rate and payment frequency on your bond your interest rate also called the the coupon rate specifies the amount of interest you earn on the bond annually as a percentage of your par or face value the payment frequency signifies whether your bond pays interest once a year or more often bonds typically pay interest either annually or semi annually once or twice per year 3 x research source this information can be found within your bond indenture for example your bond might pay a 6 coupon rate twice per year in this case the annual interest rate would be 6 divided by the number of payments within the year thus a 6 bond that pays interest twice per year would effectively pay 3 of the par value for each of the two payments during the year or 6 total find when the most recent coupon payment was made search your records to see when your bond made its latest coupon payment this information is available from the financial institution that sold you the bond calculate how many days have passed since the most recent coupon paying day this will depend on your dcc as the passage of days is calculated differently in each type of bond generally if your bond is actual actual you will actually count the days if your bond is 30 360 you would use those numbers for each month or year that has passed 4 x research source let s say you have a 30 360 bond and exactly two months have passed since your latest payment you would simply multiply 2 x 30 and use 60 days in your calculations regardless of how many days there actually were in the elapsed months confirm the face or par value of your bond this is the amount paid to the holder of the bond at maturity when the interest payments stop 5 x research source this will be stated clearly on your bond indenture note that the par value may be more or less than what you actually paid for the bond originally market price is affected by the existing rate environment and the bond issuer s creditworthiness 6 x research source bonds are often valued at 1000 that would be the par value even if you paid slightly more or less for it know the equation for bond accrued interest it s simpler than it looks a p cf dt displaystyle a p frac c f frac d t 7 x research source a is the accrued interest earned this is the figure you are solving for p is the par value of the bond c is the annual coupon rate or interest rate for our purposes it should be expressed as a decimal simply take the interest rate shown in the bond indenture and divide by 100 to produce the decimal equivalent for example a 6 rate would be expressed as 0 06 6 100 f is the payment frequency or number of payments per year this would be 2 for semi annual payments or 1 for annual ones d is the number of days since your latest coupon payment t is the total number of days in a payment period this would be 360 for annual payments and 180 for semi annual ones input your variables simply put all of the above information into the appropriate places in the equation double check everything to make sure it s expressed correctly in the above example we will use a bond with a par value of 1000 paying a 6 coupon rate semi annually with a 30 360 dcc two months 60 days have passed since the last payment so d is 60 the total days in the payment period is 180 because payments are made twice per year 360 2 180 the sample equation with all variables included would look like this a 1000 0 062 60180 displaystyle a 1000 frac 0 06 2 frac 60 180 find the period interest rate this simply means dividing the coupon rate by the payment frequency this reflects the interest rate earned in each payment period in the equation this is c divided by f in our example this calculation would give a rate of 0 03 the equation will look as follows after this calculation a 1000 0 03 60180 displaystyle a 1000 0 03 frac 60 180 calculate your day count fraction divide the number of days that have passed since the latest payment by the number of days in your current payment period this is the final part of the equation in the example this calculation would be 60 180 or 0 333 the equation should now look like this a 1000 0 03 0 333 displaystyle a 1000 0 03 0 333 determine the value of your accrued interest multiply the dcf by the face value of your bond to get the value of your accrued interest or coupon payment you are multiplying the face value by the coupon rate by the day count fraction in the example this would be a 1000 0 03 0 333 displaystyle a 1000 0 03 0 333 which simplifies to a 1000 0 01 displaystyle a 1000 0 01 the answer is then 10 your bond has earned 10 in accrued interest over the selected time frame open excel and create a new sheet start excel on your computer and start with a blank sheet so that there is no other information to distract you enter the names of the variables in the first column for this calculation we would enter the current date most recent payment date dcc par value and coupon rate put these variables on separate lines down the first column of the spreadsheet current date goes in a1 coupon rate lands in a5 input the variables next to each variable name input the actual values make sure that these values are entered correctly in other words the dates are entered as dates percentages as percentages and monetary values as such otherwise the program will not calculate the result properly in our example we use the following variables 3 31 2016 as the current date in cell b1 1 31 2016 as the last payment date in cell b2 0 as the dcc in cell b3 this indicates that we are using the 30 360 dcc inputting 1 indicates the actual actual dcc 8 x research source 1000 as the par value in cell b4 6 as the coupon rate in cell b5 create the yearfrac function and input the values the function needed to calculate bond accrued interest is known as the yearfrac function click on a nearby empty cell and type yearfrac to get started the system will prompt you to input variables click on cell b2 type in a comma to move to the next variable click on cell b1 type in a comma to move to the next variable click on cell b3 close the function with a parenthesis multiply the function by the par value and coupon rate in the same cell as the function after you ve closed the function you must multiply it by your other two variables simply type in b4 b5 directly after the function with no spaces anywhere your completed entry into this cell should look like this yearfrac b2 b1 b3 b4 b5 press enter and get your answer the program will solve your equation when you press enter on the cell that contains your function be sure to adjust the type of number in the cell to currency by selecting it at the top of the page under number this will ensure that your answer is displayed correctly in the example this function yields 10 which is exactly the same as it was in our manual calculation,Finance-and-Business
how to find a good real estate agent,whether you re buying or selling a property a quality real estate agent is vital to make the process run smoothly seek out an agent with excellent credentials and references meet with a handful of agents to make sure any questions you have are answered watch out for potential red flags agents who charge very low costs or only work part time may not be reliable,look for someone who does at least 1 or 2 transactions every month when reviewing an agent s credentials look for someone who s been working in sales negotiations and contracts for at least five years preferably in real estate or property management five years experience and a regular stream of transactions means an agent likely has a good feel for the process and can help find you the best deals 1 x research source agents with less experience can still be a good choice if they know you and the area well especially if they demonstrate a great work ethic and strong customer service skills find someone who works in your area the agent you work with should know the area in which you re looking to buy or sell agents who live and work in your area will be aware of the best neighborhoods and trends regarding prices a local agent will also know small details like where the best schools are commute times and so on 2 x research source check the agent s license obviously you want an agent who s properly licensed every state should have a list of licensed agents online while making a list of agents to contact check to ensure every agent you interview has a legal license to buy and sell real estate in your state you can also see the continuing education classes they are taking which will help you to know what their focus is 3 x research source look for awards and honors to help narrow your choices check a real estate s website and resume for awards honors and other signs of recognition things like a realtor of the year award can be a sign of a quality agent who s likely to exceed your personal needs however realize that it may also indicate a very busy realtor who may not be the right choice if you d like more individual attention and you may need to base your decision on other indicators 4 x research source ask friends and family members for referrals if you know someone who recently bought or sold a home reach out to them friends and family members are likely to give you honest assessments of their experience with a particular agent 5 x research source however be cautious about choosing an agent only because a friend or family member recommended them your real estate needs and what you desire in a realtor may be different so make sure you understand what exactly your friends or family s objectives were and what specifically they liked about their realtor ask about any hesitations the person has recommending the agent as well this way you ll get a sense if the agent has any major flaws that would be a deal breaker for you ask how long they ve been in business when interviewing a real estate agent one of the first questions to ask is how long they ve been handling sales contracts and negotiations for clients they should be able to answer the question quickly and accurately remember while five years of experience is ideal someone with less experience who otherwise meets your needs may still work if you ve developed a good rapport with them 6 x research source also ask how long the agent s been working in your area even better ask if they live near the area an agent with extensive experience may not be the best choice if they are not familiar with your particular area ask if they work alone or in a team agents who work alone are best if you want a lot of personal contact with the agent agents who work on a team are good if you like the idea of specialists for each step the agent you hire may actually be a team leader who will then introduce you to a transaction coordinator assistant or buyer s agent who will handle those parts of the transaction 7 x research source agents who work alone are more likely to walk you through each step themselves and more likely to reach out frequently by phone or even in person ask about any planned vacations or other commitments real estate often requires quick action and response time if a realtor has a vacation planned soon or some other commitment that might interfere with their availability you need to decide whether this will affect you buying or selling a property make sure they have someone to help you out if they will have an extended absence 8 x research source ask about what other properties they ve sold in addition to looking at current properties online have the agent show you some of the other properties they ve sold make sure these properties are similar to what you re looking to buy or sell it s vital to pick an agent who works with the right properties for your needs if the agent is typically used to working at a higher or lower price point they may not understand your particular transaction as well 9 x research source if you re selling a home ask where the home will be featured the main places you ll need to be is on the mls and the big online sites realtor com zillow trulia etc other sites including the agent s personal website aren t as important also beware of an agent who wants to keep your house off the mls for any reason unless you are selling a luxury home the mls is where most buyers and their agents are pocket listings or similar are generally suggested when an agent wants to market your house first to their own investor clients or to others in their brokerage but limiting the exposure is almost never a good option for you as a seller contact their recent clients ask for a list of references after meeting with an agent a quality agent will not hesitate to hand you a list of recent clients for you to call to ask about their experience call a few references for every agent you interview to make sure they have stellar reviews don t put too much stock in online reviews most people will give a 5 star review in exchange for a starbucks gift card and a single bad review may not tell the whole story ask the agent if you re concerned 10 x research source make sure you get along with the agent chemistry is important in real estate if you re working with someone who you don t get along with this can cause unnecessary tension during an already stressful process make sure you click with the agent and feel comfortable in their presence 11 x research source avoid agents who don t answer their phone or return calls a good real estate agent considers their work a full time job and knows that weekends and evenings can be the busiest times in real estate every day is a business day and if crucial items come up on evenings or weekends you need an agent whom you can reach an agent who isn t available throughout the day may not be your best option if an agent does not answer during regular business hours you may have an agent who is doing real estate on the side their day job may not allow them to give you the attention you deserve conversely an agent who doesn t answer evening or weekend calls or worse yet has a voicemail that states anything about the next business day may not be available when you need them 12 x research source stay away from agents who don t know the area if an agent does not work in your area or cannot readily provide information about the area this is a bad sign a quality agent should be able to quickly rattle off things like neighborhoods general price ranges nearby businesses and so on if an agent cannot provide specific details about an area you may want to find someone who knows it better 13 x research source check that lower commissions don t mean fewer services typical commissions are usually between five and seven percent when agent offers a lower commission make sure they aren t offering you less service than higher commissioned agents before signing a contract verify that all of their promises are in writing 14 x research source when buying you don t usually have to worry about the commission because the seller generally pays both sides buyer and seller so focus instead on customer service and contract knowledge,Finance-and-Business
how to ask rich people for money,fundraising for charity is an important part of any nonprofit group s work in the u s alone donors gave almost 287 billion in 2011 1 x research source many people who work for nonprofits feel uncomfortable asking donors for money but without their help most nonprofit groups would not be able to carry out their missions learning how to effectively and respectfully ask wealthy individuals for money can help you ensure your charity or favorite nonprofit federally recognized as 501 c 3 group prospers and is able to help those in need,compile a list of donors before you begin asking for money it s best to have an idea of who you re going to ask for donations if you re going door to door that may be as simple as deciding which neighborhood s to work in if you re soliciting donations by phone or by mail though you ll need a list of prospective donors to contact 2 x research source if you can identify past donors on your list of people to call or write to you may want to prioritize those individuals as best bets these are people who given their history of donating in the past will most likely contribute again to your cause 3 x research source try to identify which people on your list are the most financially stable you can do this by interacting with the individual to get a sense of his or her finances or if going door to door look at the houses residents live in and the cars in their driveways people with large elaborate homes or flashy sports cars most likely have more disposable income though of course this doesn t guarantee that they will give donations 4 x research source you can also look for potential donors by their other areas of spending for example does the prospective donor attend fundraisers for other organizations or individuals if so that prospective donor probably has the means to donate to your organization if properly persuaded 5 x research source consider using analytical software and services such as donor search to identify which potential donors are more wealthy and more likely to donate 6 x research source remember to think abc when identifying donors able to make a gift belief known or potential in your cause and contact connection with your organization 7 x research source get to know your donors if your organization has dealt with donors in the past you or a colleague will probably know what strategies work best in making your appeal some people want to know how the money from last year was spent while others may simply want to know how much is needed certain donors may have fears or reservations about donating and it s important to learn to recognize those fears reservations so you can address them in advance 8 x research source some donors may need to hear particular terms or phrases in order to be persuaded to donate if you know this to be the case make some indication of this on your list so that when you call or approach that person you ll know what to say 9 x research source any time a donor seems reluctant to give but gives anyway make a note of that situation on your list or in that donor s file if you have one listen to what the individual says when he or she is reluctant and try to find ways to assuage those fears not just for this year s fundraiser but for future years as well 10 x research source be aware that many well known philanthropists hire other individuals to manage donations and contributions because of this you may not get to speak to the actual donor himself herself however the employees hired by a philanthropist probably have the same concerns that the philanthropist does and you may have some luck appealing to the philanthropist s interests through his or her employees find ways to present your organization people who have donated to your organization will no doubt be familiar with who you are as an organization and what you do but what about people who have never donated before how will you describe what you do to an outsider this is important as it may determine whether the individual will listen to the rest of your pitch if possible try to compile some data on what your organization has done in the past the problems you hope to address after this fundraising drive and how that prospective donation would help your cause 11 x research source try to present your organization in a way that both explains what you do while also highlighting the issue you seek to change for example you might say something like did you know that the issue your organization addresses affects a significant portion of the city and we are the only organization solely committed to addressing these issues in a comprehensive way it s not a requirement to have data compiled but for individuals who aren t familiar with your organization it may be very helpful to know that information 12 x research source consider printing out a brochure or having a reusable chart to illustrate both the improvements you ve made and the improvements you hope to make 13 x research source think about what you might say if someone doesn t understand your organization s goals or what you might say if someone was dismissive of your organization try putting yourself in those shoes imagining that you were someone who didn t want to help the organization and what you might say to the organization then imagine how you might respond to hearing those words the better your donor base understands your organization and the better you understand your donors the more likely you ll be to build a long term relationship with that donor 14 x research source practice your appeal one of the best things you can do to strengthen your appeal for donations is to practice what you re going to say that doesn t just mean knowing how to actually ask for money but also knowing how to initiate the conversation practicing scenarios anticipating potential responses and knowing how to direct or re direct the conversation 15 x research source remember that the best appeal will educate the potential donor rather than making a simple sales pitch 16 x research source practice your appeal out loud get comfortable with the speech and learn to adapt it to your own style of speaking make it your own speech and try to make it feel comfortable and unrehearsed even though this may take a lot of rehearsal 17 x research source practice in front of a mirror if you will be interacting with donors face to face 18 x research source try recording yourself either with a tape recorder or on video and study your mannerisms and your speech patterns does it sound honest do your vocal patterns and your physical mannerisms communicate the message of your organization and the urgency of what you re trying to solve 19 x research source start a conversation don t just call and start running in with your pitch work on creating a dialogue with the potential donor which may mean making some polite small talk at the start it can be as simple as asking the person how his or her day is going anything to start a conversation should help disarm the individual and make the person realize that you re a caring and concerned member of the community 20 x research source if the prospective donor is a known philanthropist he or she may prefer to have someone who heads the foundation ask for a donation statistically donors are more likely to give money to a recognizable figure affiliated with an organization rather than to a fundraiser who contacts them on the organization s behalf 21 x research source initiate the conversation by getting the prospective donor to acknowledge an existing problem if you re raising money for a local organization you might open the conversation by asking what he or she thinks is the greatest crisis facing your region 22 x research source make your intentions known you shouldn t just introduce yourself by asking for money but you should make your intentions known near the end of your small talk start by asking how the person is doing or commenting on the weather and then use that as a lead in to say i m working with _______ and we re trying to help _______ be able to ________ 23 x research source if the individual feels like you re just having an aimless conversation and then suddenly he or she is asked for money it may create tension and cause the person to feel like you re shaking them down be calm friendly and casual but don t drag your feet about making it clear that you have a purpose 24 x research source let the other person speak chances are if you launch into your usual appeal to a person on the street who s never donated before that person will walk away but if you have created a dialogue and made room for the other person to speak you may be able to get that individual to feel engaged and a part of the solution try asking a question say something like what do you think is the biggest problem our community faces once the person has answered instead of simply saying yes you re right will you consider donating try a more nuanced approach after the person says what he or she sees as the problem just say how interesting and keep silent while remaining interested 25 x research source people fear silence and the person will probably fill that gap by elaborating on why that issue is important that potential donor may go on to talk about how a family member has been affected by those issues this gives you an in to take the specific concern he she has and run with it it s no longer an abstract concern but a specific problem that may have affected the individual personally 26 x research source make a specific request if you leave a donation appeal open ended the person may not end up donating or may only give a few dollars but if you ask for a specific amount it takes a lot of guess work out of the equation for that individual and makes it easier to commit to your request for example if the person seems interested say something like well we can make a difference for just _____ dollars you can help accomplish ___________ 27 x research source another way to ask for a specific amount is to put the ball in their court ask something like would you consider a gift of _____ or is ______ something you d be willing to consider to help tackle the problem of __________ 28 x research source be persistent many people will say no right off the bat but others may simply need to be persuaded a bit more perhaps someone might say that the amount you requested is too high if that happens let the person know that any donation amount would be a big help and ask if there s a slightly lower amount that the person would be willing able to donate don t be aggressive with your appeal but do be insistent that your cause is worthy and that any donation amount would help that cause thank the person either way if the individual is willing to donate then it s cause for celebration you can thank the person and let him or her know that that donation will go a long way towards solving or addressing the issue at hand but even if the person is not interested in donating you should still be polite and appreciative of their time simply say well thank you for your time and have a wonderful day 29 x research source expressing gratitude and courtesy can go a long way just because someone isn t interested in donating that doesn t mean the situation won t change perhaps next year the people who said no will have heard or read more about your organization or perhaps the individual will have been personally affected by the issue you re seeking to address making a good impression now even when turned down may be what helps you get a donation next year 30 x research source follow up with donors if someone gave a donation you should absolutely express gratitude send the donor a thank you letter and a gift receipt in case they want to write it off on their taxes or simply have a record of the donation it s best to send these items as quickly as possible so that the donor knows that the contribution was greatly appreciated and will be put to good use 31 x research source,Finance-and-Business
how to develop a risk management plan,developing an effective risk management plan can help keep small issues from developing into emergencies different types of risk management plans can deal with calculating the probability of an event and how that event might impact you what the risks are with certain ventures and how to mitigate the problems associated with those risks having a plan may help you deal with adverse situations when they arise and hopefully head them off before they arise,understand how risk management works risk is the effect positive or negative of an event or series of events that take place in one or several locations it is computed from the probability of the event becoming an issue and the impact it would have see risk probability x impact various factors should be identified in order to analyze risk including event what could happen smallurl https www wikihow com images thumb c c2 develop a risk management plan step 1bullet1 jpg v4 460px develop a risk

reduction after you identify the above the result will be what s called exposure this is the amount of risk you simply can t avoid exposure may also be referred to as threat liability or severity but they pretty much mean the same thing it will be used to help determine if the planned activity should take place this is often a simple cost vs benefits formula you might use these elements to determine if the risk of implementing the change is higher or lower than the risk of not implementing the change assumed risk if you decide to proceed sometimes there is no choice e g federally mandated changes then your exposure becomes what is known as assumed risk in some environments assumed risk is reduced to a dollar value which is then used to calculate the profitability of the end product define your project in this article let s pretend you are responsible for a computer system that provides important but not life critical information to some large population the main computer on which this system resides is old and needs to be replaced your task is to develop a risk management plan for the migration this will be a simplified model where risk and impact are listed as high medium or low that is very common especially in project management get input from others brainstorm on risks get several people together that are familiar with the project and ask for input on what could happen how to help prevent it and what to do if it does happen take a lot of notes you will use the output of this very important session several times during the following steps try to keep an open mind about ideas out of the box thinking is good but do keep control of the session it needs to stay focused and on target identify the consequences of each risk from your brainstorming session you gathered information about what would happen if risks materialized associate each risk with the consequences arrived at during that session be as specific as possible with each one project delay is not as desirable as project will be delayed by 13 days if there is a dollar value list it just saying over budget is too general eliminate irrelevant issues if you re moving for example a car dealership s computer system then threats such as nuclear war plague pandemic or killer asteroids are pretty much things that will disrupt the project there s nothing you can do to plan for them or to lessen the impact you might keep them in mind but don t put that kind of thing on your risk plan list all identified risk elements you don t need to put them in any order just yet just list them one by one assign probability for each risk element on your list determine if the likelihood of it actually materializing is high medium or low if you absolutely have to use numbers then figure probability on a scale from 0 00 to 1 00 0 01 to 0 33 low 0 34 to 0 66 medium 0 67 to 1 00 high note if the probability of an event occurring is zero then it will be removed from consideration there s no reason to consider things that simply cannot happen enraged t rex eats the computer assign impact in general assign impact as high medium or low based on some pre established guidelines if you absolutely have to use numbers then figure impact on a scale from 0 00 to 1 00 as follows 0 01 to 0 33 low 0 34 066 medium 0 67 1 00 high note if the impact of an event is zero it should not be listed there s no reason to consider things that are irrelevant regardless of the probability my dog ate dinner determine risk for the element often a table is used for this if you have used the low medium and high values for probability and impact the top table is most useful if you have used numeric values you will need to consider a bit more complex rating system similar to the second table here it is important to note that there is no universal formula for combining probability and impact that will vary between people and projects this is only an example albeit a real life one be flexible in analysis sometimes it may be appropriate to switch back and forth between the l m h designations and numeric designations you might use a table similar to the one below rank the risks list all the elements you have identified from the highest risk to the lowest risk compute the total risk here is where numbers will help you in table 6 you have 7 risks assigned as h h m m m l and l this can translate to 0 8 0 8 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 2 and 0 2 from table 5 the average of the total risk is then 0 5 and this translates to medium develop mitigation strategies mitigation is designed to reduce the probability that a risk will materialize normally you will only do this for high and medium elements you might want to mitigate low risk items but certainly address the other ones first for example if one of your risk elements is that there could be a delay in delivery of critical parts you might mitigate the risk by ordering early in the project develop contingency plans contingency is designed to reduce the impact if a risk does materialize again you will usually only develop contingencies for high and medium elements for example if the critical parts you need do not arrive on time you might have to use old existing parts while you re waiting for the new ones analyze the effectiveness of strategies how much have you reduced the probability and impact evaluate your contingency and mitigation strategies and reassign effective ratings to your risks compute your effective risk now your 7 risks are m m m l l l and l which translate to 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 2 0 2 0 2 and 0 2 this gives an average risk of 0 329 looking at table 5 we see that the overall risk is now categorized as low originally the risk was medium 0 5 after management strategies have been added your exposure is low 0 329 that means you have achieved a 34 2 reduction in risk through mitigation and contingency not bad monitor your risks now that you know what your risks are you need to determine how you ll know if they materialize so you ll know when and if you should put your contingencies in place this is done by identifying risk cues do this for each one of your high and medium risk elements then as your project progresses you will be able to determine if a risk element has become an issue if you don t know these cues it is very possible a risk could silently materialize and affect the project even if

how to close a bank account,most banks allow customers to open and close accounts regularly however there may be hidden procedures in the fine print of your contract one challenge with closing bank accounts is that so many deposit and withdrawal services are automated another concern is the potential for hidden fees or additional hassle you must prepare your bank account carefully in order to close it successfully and avoid potential disruptions to your finances,determine the kind of banking experience you want most traditional banks have both online services and physical locations some new financial institutions however offer only online banking options take the time to review the available resources and offerings at various banks banks with brick and mortar branches can be more comfortable if you prefer to work with a live person and to have a physical location to deposit and withdraw your money online banking can be efficient especially if you are experienced with online banking and are used to paperless finances consider non traditional options such as credit unions money market mutual funds and cash management accounts 1 x research source evaluate your financial

how to calculate and compare unit prices at the store,sometimes it s hard to tell if a bigger package is really a better value when you re shopping for items at a store fortunately checking the item s unit price can help you figure out which package provides the most product for the cost the unit price is the cost per quantity of item you re receiving the quantity might be per item or per unit of measurement such as ounces grams gallons or liters to calculate the unit price simply divide the cost of the product by the quantity you re receiving or check the store s shelf label then compare the unit prices of 2 or more packages of the same product to see which is the better value,check the item s total price the unit price is typically a fraction of the total cost of the product look at the price tag or use a price scanning tool to find the total price of the product 1 x research source if you have a coupon subtract the coupon value from the total price before you calculate the unit price find the quantity of the item that the package contains look on the label to check the amount of product in the container the quantity is normally listed on the bottom right corner of the package 2 x research source some products will be sold by item such as toilet paper paper towels or pencils however most items will have a unit of measurement like ounces cups quarts gallons milliliters liters etc make sure both products have the same unit of measurement sometimes the products you re comparing measure their quantity using different units such as quarts versus gallons or ounces versus grams if this is the case change the unit of measurement for one of the products to match the other before you calculate the unit rate 3 x research source for example let s say you re looking at a quart of milk for 1 25 and a gallon of milk for 4 29 there are 4 quarts in a gallon so you could adjust the price for the quart of milk by multiplying it by 4 to purchase a gallon of milk in individual quart size bottles you d pay 1 25 x 4 which is 5 00 similarly let s say you re looking at a liter of vegetable oil for 9 79 and a 12 oz bottle for 4 99 one liter contains 33 8 ounces so you can use that number as your quantity divide the total price by the quantity to get the unit price use your calculator or phone to find the unit price if you re doing the math by hand use long division to divide the total price by the quantity here are some examples 4 x research source let s say the product is a 6 roll pack of toilet paper for 4 59 to get the unit price you d divide 4 59 by 6 to get 0 77 the unit price is 0 77 similarly you might be considering a 24 oz bottle of shampoo for 13 79 divide 13 79 by 24 which is 0 57 look for the unit cost on the product label for an easier option most stores include the product s unit price on the shelf label for that product typically the unit price is printed in small type in the top or lower left corner and may have a box around it check the shelf label to see if the unit price is there 5 x research source as an example when you re looking at an 8 oz bottle of olive oil that costs 5 79 you might see a unit price of 0 72 printed in small type in the corner of the label calculate the unit price of the items you re planning to buy divide the total cost of each product by the quantity in the package get the unit price for each item 6 x research source for instance let s say you re trying to choose between a 6 roll pack of toilet paper for 4 59 and a 9 roll pack of toilet paper for 7 29 to get the unit prices calculate 4 59 6 0 77 and 7 29 9 0 81 alternatively you might be trying to choose between a 32 oz family sized box of cereal for 4 89 and a 12 oz regular sized box of cereal for 2 29 you d calculate 4 89 32 0 15 and 2 29 12 0 19 choose the item with the lowest unit price generally the product with the lowest unit cost is the best value compare the unit prices that you calculated to see which one is lower then purchase that product 7 x research source as an example if a 6 roll pack of toilet paper has a unit price of 0 77 and the 9 roll pack has a unit price of 0 81 the 6 roll pack is the best choice alternatively a family sized box of cereal is a better deal at a unit price of 0 15 versus a smaller box at a unit price of 0 19 make sure that the quality of the items is similar if that matters to you typically items that are of lesser quality will have a lower unit cost you might still choose to purchase the less expensive item however consider the quality of the items when making a final purchasing decision 8 x research source for example a toilet paper that has a thicker ply or more sheets may have a higher unit cost than single ply toilet paper with a low sheet count in this case you might decide that the higher quality toilet paper is a better value for you,Finance-and-Business

degree working in an entry level position so you have a little professional experience in the field 3 x research source most investment bankers start as a financial analysts in that position you study and analyze the market and produce reports that business executives use to make sound financial decisions get an mba while some investment banks will hire new associates fresh out of college most investment bankers have an mba this can be a relatively large investment especially if you go to a top business school with a good reputation 4 x research source evaluate business schools closely don t just go to the first one that accepts you while the cost of tuition may be a huge factor for you it shouldn t be the only factor many reputable business schools have part time or evening mba programs if you plan on working while you get your mba contact the career center at the business school of your university many banks connect with universities and schedule internship and new associate interviews through the school you can learn about these opportunities by visiting the career services office 5 x research source the business school typically will be more connected to investment banks than the general career services office for undergrads would be smaller boutique investment banks typically don t visit schools or recruit large classes of interns and new hires if you want to work for a smaller bank you ll have to seek them out on your own network with experienced professionals your connections to working investment bankers are just as important as the skills and information you re learning in school talking to investment bankers online and in person is a great way to get your name out there 6 x research source if your school has an investment banking club join it they typically have a lot of events that provide good networking opportunities clean up your social media accounts so that you can use them to network with investment bankers you may want to remove those pictures from your spring break trip and join a professional social media platform such as linkedin have informational interviews with experienced investment bankers if they re local to you call and invite them to lunch and tell them you want to pick their brain most professionals love to share their wisdom and give advice to people just starting out go back to school unless you already have a business or finance related degree you will be more attractive to investment banks if you get some direct education to prepare you for the financial services industry 7 x research source if you don t have a degree at all it s typically impossible to get into the investment banking profession however if you have several years in another profession and an undergraduate degree in something else you may still have a chance you might want to consider a part time or night mba program there are many reputable business schools that offer these programs for mid career professionals and most investment banks only recruit from business schools 8 x research source look for references if you started a career in another field have professional and personal references who can vouch for your skill and work ethic investment banks want to know that you were a leader in your previous field 9 x research source try to find someone who understands the traits and skills that investment banking requires you want references who know what to emphasize get a professional certification professional certifications require you to study and pass lengthy exams but they can help set you apart from the competition and typically are cheaper than getting an mba 10 x research source for example you can become a chartered financial analyst cfa after three phases of tests and with four years experience in the field the preparation for the exams typically is self study so you can do it on your own time network aggressively with investment bankers the world of investment banking often is more about who you know than what you know this is especially true if you are trying to enter investment banking from another industry or career path 11 x research source join professional associations or groups for investment bankers if you live near large investment banks hanging out at cafés or restaurants near the banks can be a good way to meet investment bankers casually keep in contact with investment bankers you meet and follow up with them regularly you want to stay on their mind if something comes up that they think might interest you offer to do an unpaid internship many investment banks train new employees through internships but internships typically are offered through universities if you re far removed from your school days but have the financial means to go without or with substantially less income for a few months an unpaid internship might work for you 12 x research source most large investment banks have fairly rigid and traditional recruiting processes you may have to find a smaller boutique firm for this idea to have a chance let all of the contacts in your network know that you re looking for an internship they may be able to help you out apply for training programs larger investment banks have established training programs for recent graduates that provide you with additional education as well as some hands on experience working in the investment bank 13 x research source these programs are highly competitive so don t get discouraged if you get rejected apply to as many as possible to increase your odds look at the characteristics of the last associate class to get a taste for what an investment bank is looking for in a new associate take an active part in your training the training programs for investment bankers are intense and grueling expect to work between 12 and 15 hours a day while you re in training much of that time under stress 14 x research source you ll typically need to pass exams to get a license to buy and sell stocks and other commodities for your clients as an investment banker the training programs provide you with the information you need to pass these exams dress the part investment banking is still by and large a formal and traditional business wear a tailored business suit in a dark color such as black or dark gray your appearance should be groomed and professional 15 x research source any accessories you wear should be understated avoid anything flashy or distracting get the appropriate licenses depending on what you re doing as an investment banker and the laws of your country you probably will need to get licenses or register with regulators before you can conduct certain activities as an investment banker such as buying and selling stock for your clients 16 x research source if you were fortunate enough to get into a training program with a larger investment bank they ll provide you the information and resources you need to pass licensing exams otherwise you ll have to study for these exams on your own you may be able to find study resources or even copies of old exams on the internet do a general internet search or look on the website of the department or agency administering the exam keep up with continuing education requirements most licenses and certifications require you to complete a specific number of hours of continuing education courses each year if you want to maintain your license or certification in good standing 17 x research source make sure your contact information with the department or agency that issued your license is up to date they ll use it to send notices to you when your license is up for renewal try to spread your continuing education out over the whole year rather than leaving it to the last minute that way you can take classes that actually interest you and will benefit your clients,Finance-and-Business

how to calculate maturity value,maturity value is the amount payable to an investor at the end of a debt instrument s holding period maturity date for most bonds the maturity value is the face amount of the bond for some certificates of deposit cd and other investments all of the interest is paid at maturity if all of the interest is paid at maturity each of the interest payments may be compounded to calculate the maturity value for these investments the investor adds all of the compounding interest to the principal amount original investment,go over the features of a bond a bond is issued to raise money for some purpose corporations issue bonds to raise money to run the business government entities such as a city or state may issue a bond to pay for a project a municipality may issue a bond to build a new public swimming pool for example 1 x research source every bond is issued with a specific face amount the face amount of the bond is the amount an investor receives at maturity the maturity date of a bond is the date that the issuer must repay the face amount in some cases the face amount and all of the interest earned is repaid on the maturity date all of the details of the bond are listed on a bond certificate today bond certificates are issued in electronic form investment professionals refer to this electronic format as book entry form the face amount and maturity date are listed on the book entry document along with the interest rate if you buy a 10 000 6 ibm corporate bond due in 10 years for example all of those details will be listed on the electronic bond certificate consider the amount that you receive on the maturity date most corporate bonds pay interest semi annually at maturity you receive the face amount of the bond other debt instruments such as certificates of deposit cds pay the face amount and all of the interest at maturity another term for the face amount is the principal 2 x research source the formula to calculate interest earned is principal amount multiplied by interest rate multiplied by time period the annual interest for the ibm bond is 10 000 x 6 x 1 year 600 if all of the interest was paid at maturity the first year s interest of 600 would not be paid until the end of 10 years in fact each year s interest would be paid at the end of 10 years along with the face amount principal add in the impact of compounding compounding means that the investor earns interest on both the face amount of the debt instrument and any prior interest earned if your investment pays all of the interest at maturity you will probably earn compounding interest on your past interest earnings 3 x research source the periodic rate is the rate of interest you earn for a particular time period such as a day week or month to calculate compounding interest you need to determine the periodic rate assume that your investment earns 12 interest annually your interest compounds monthly in this case your periodic rate is 12 12 months 1 to compound interest you multiply the periodic rate by the face amount use the periodic rate to compute your interest earned assume that you own a 1 000 12 certificate of deposit that matures in 3 years your cd pays all of the interest at maturity to compute the maturity value you need to calculate all of your compounding interest 4 x research source say that your cd compounds interest monthly you periodic rate is 12 12 months 1 to keep it simple assume that each month has 30 days many investments including corporate bonds use a 360 day year to calculate interest assume that january is the first month that you own the cd in month one your interest is 1 000 x 1 10 to calculate interest for february you need to add the january interest to your principal amount your new principal amount for february is 1 000 10 1 010 in february you earn interest totaling 1 010 x 1 10 10 you see that your february interest is higher than january s amount by 10 cents you earn additional interest because of compounding each month you add all of the prior interest to the original 1 000 principal amount the total is your new principal balance you use that balance to calculate interest for the next period a month in this case apply a formula to quickly calculate maturity value rather than compute compounding interest manually you can use a formula the maturity value formula is v p x 1 r n you see that v p r and n are variables in the formula v is the maturity value p is the original principal amount and n is the number of compounding intervals from the time of issue to maturity date the variable r represents that periodic interest rate 5 x research source for example consider a 5 year 10 000 cd compounded monthly the annual interest rate is 4 80 percent the periodic rate the r variable is 048 12 months 004 the number of compounding periods n is calculated by taking the number of years in the security and multiplying by the frequency of compounding in this case your can compute the number of periods as 5 years x 12 months 60 months the variable n equals 60 the maturity value or v 10 000 times 1 004 60 the maturity value v works out to 12 706 41 6 x research source search for an online maturity value calculator find an online calculator for maturity value using a search engine make your search specific to the security you are valuing if you own a money market fund for example type in money market fund maturity value calculator 7 x research source search for a reputable site the quality and usability of each online calculator tool can vary greatly use two different calculators to validate your results input your information enter the data from your investment or proposed investment into the calculator tool this will include the principal annual rate of interest and the duration of the investment it may also include the frequency of compounding for the investment check the result make sure that the maturity value makes sense to verify that the maturity date is reasonable it probably makes sense to confirm the result in another online tool,Finance-and-Business

residential units this usually increases the value of the land 1 x research source when the land is subdivided into more than one lot each lot is then sold to one or more buyers this is more profitable than keeping the property as one residential unit smaller residential lots may be easier to sell than larger pieces of land this increases the overall value of the land evaluate the risk of subdividing your property subdividing property is commonplace among land developers builders real estate agents and other professionals however if you are new to the process it can be risky if you don t do your due diligence evaluate a number of preliminary items to determine whether your property is even eligible for subdivision you could waste a lot of time and money designing and applying for a subdivision when your property isn t even eligible 2 x research source consider the size and scope of your plans the complexities associated with subdividing property increase as the property size

location if most homes that sell in the area are smaller or are on smaller lots don t elect to build large expensive houses on big lots they won t sell for nearly as much as they might in a more upscale neighborhood an appraiser won t be able to assign a value to a home that s any higher than the highest home price in the location so it s wise to research the market and begin with an appropriate size and price in mind 11 x research source understand zoning and other requirements even if there are no ordinances covenants or other restrictions stopping you from subdividing the land

available for your lots and that they can handle the added capacity of the new residences you plan to build there 15 x research source this process is sometimes referred to as site development or technical due diligence it is the process of evaluating the availability of and options for key utilities and infrastructure at the building lot like power water sewer and communications 16 x research source if you are buying a finished lot for sale your agreement with the builder will cover these services if you are buying a vacant or undeveloped lot outside of a neighborhood or established city limit you will have to make plans for getting power water sewer and communications services to the property 17 x research source electric and gas power can be brought to the property by the power

that the same goal may be met in a multitude of ways to save money for that backpacking trip to europe for example you might replace your coffee shop stops with home brewed coffee and save 20 per week alternatively you might provide child care for a friend one afternoon a week and apply your earnings toward the trip determine whether one goal will impact another in addition to identifying alternative courses of action within your financial goals you should consider how your goals interact you might consider travel a lifestyle goal for example but after careful consideration realize

choices involve opportunity costs an opportunity cost is what you give up when you make a choice 10 x research source saving for that backpacking trip by giving up coffee shop visits might include sacrifices of time planning and the conversation you enjoy with your favorite barista research potential decisions like a scientist gather as much research as you can and carefully evaluate your data if you are considering an investment for example you should pay special attention to the correlation between risk and reward how risky is the investment and how much reward will you receive if it is successful are the benefits worth the risks 11 x research source recognize that uncertainty will always be part of the picture 12 x research source even once you ve carefully completed your research the parameters of your situation may change the economy may dip lowering investment concerns the new job you opt to pursue may leave you personally or professionally unsatisfied do your best and remember that you retain the ability to adjust your decisions later look at the big picture now that you ve developed goals identified alternatives and evaluated those alternatives create a list of the strategies you ve identified consider your current situation and then start thinking about which goals might be most realistic take your current net worth into account if your liabilities approach or outweigh your current net assets you ll want to take steps to change that ratio while you may opt to focus on developing your net assets don t forget that paying off debt can be a great investment interest charges mean that even paltry debts can become overwhelming over time allocating some resources toward debt reduction now may prevent serious problems from developing later 13 x research source decide which goals you ll pursue now strive for a balanced approach toward short intermediate and long term goals that will enable you to plan for a few months and a few years down the line focus upon incremental growth by doing so you will create a road map that will take you toward your goals be realistic you won t be able to adopt all the great strategies you ve evaluated at once but selecting a balanced range of goals will help you meet the goals you do choose and grow toward a point when you can take on additional projects develop a budget that incorporates your financial planning goals you already know your net assets and liabilities from your analysis of your current net worth set these into a framework that includes the decisions you ve made then hold yourself accountable for these decisions if you ve committed to spending 80 less per month on coffee and placing that money in a savings account list that in your budget goals such as obtaining a new job may not fit neatly into a budget but should be listed in an easy to reference location as part of your working financial plan consider hiring a professional financial adviser you may be fully capable of making financial decisions but a professional adviser has the advantage of emotional detachment from your financial situation 14 x research source think of your financial plan as a working document personal financial planning is a process life changes and you ll need to update your plan over time as your circumstances and goals change plan to review your financial goals on a regular basis if you find your life circumstances change quickly as a college student for example you may opt to review these goals every 6 months if your life tends to be more stable as an adult empty nester for example you might plan on an annual review discuss your personal financial plan with your partner if you re already in a committed relationship hopefully you ve pursued this process as a couple when making a relationship commitment financial discussions should be part of the conversation about your values goals and plans for reaching those goals,Finance-and-Business
how to calculate the net asset value,the net asset value nav is the calculation that determines the value of a share in a fund of multiple securities such as a mutual fund hedge fund or exchange traded fund etf while stock prices change constantly when markets are open the nav of a fund is calculated at the end of business each day to reflect the price changes in the investments owned by the fund this nav calculation makes it easy for investors to track the value of their shares in a fund and the nav of a share in a fund generally establishes its selling price,choose the valuation date the net asset value nav of a mutual fund hedge fund or etf changes every day the stock market is open as the value of the fund s investments fluctuate for your net asset value calculation to be valuable you must use fund data for the calculation on a date that is relevant to your needs choose a specific date and ensure all the values you use to calculate your fund net asset value come from this date calculate the total value of the fund s securities at the end of the valuation date the fund s securities are its ownership of stocks bonds and other securities as these securities values are posted daily you can learn the value of your fund s investment in each kind of security at the end of the valuation date 1 x research source this total should include value of any cash on hand on the valuation date as well as any short term or long term assets held by the fund subtract outstanding fund liabilities in addition to investments the fund likely has several outstanding liabilities these are amounts the fund has borrowed to make additional investments in the hopes that the fund can earn interest on its investments at a higher rate than it pays on its outstanding loans subtract the amount of these debts from the total value of the securities you calculated the fund s prospectus will list each of its assets and liabilities download the prospectus online or call for it by phone most newspapers will have daily stock listings showing the closing price of any publicly traded stock divide by the number of outstanding shares in the fund the result of this calculation is the net asset value or the value of one share s portion of the assets owned by the fund 2 x research source if you own multiple shares in the fund you can multiply the nav by the number of shares you own to learn the market value of your investment the nav generally determines the buy or sell price of a mutual fund share so you should expect to be able to sell back your shares for relatively close to the nav for mutual funds nav per share is calculated every day it is based on the closing prices of the securities in the fund 3 x research source buy and sell orders for mutual funds are processed based on the nav for the date since the nav is calculated at the close of business investors must wait until the next business day to make the trade at that price 4 x research source calculate your fund s total return the total return on a fund is the sum of the value of any dividends the fund paid out the value of any capital gains the fund paid out and any increase in nav over the life of the purchaser s holding divided by the purchase price of the fund the total return is expressed as a percentage to illustrate what percent of the purchase price holders have received in cash distributions and fund appreciation during the fund life mutual funds are required by law to distribute capital gains positive cash flow from the purchase and sale of stock with mutual funds to fund shareholders this is different than a share of stock where the holder receives capital gains as an increase to share price not a direct pay out for this reason the nav of a fund isn t enough on its own to evaluate long term performance of a fund evaluate your fund s total return rate you should analyze your total return rate to determine whether or not you are earning enough income off of your fund investment most funds are fairly diverse and mutual funds should over perform the stock market 5 x research source while the stock market does fluctuate constantly you should evaluate your fund s performance against the market s to ensure you are getting a reasonable return from 1926 to the present the annualized return for the s p 500 has been about 10 percent the annualized return from sept 2005 to sept 2015 for s p 500 has been about 7 6 x research source note that returns can vary depending upon holding period and that returns of individual stocks can vary significantly you should compare your total return rate to the return rate on the stock market for the period you are assessing while considering your overall acceptable return rate evaluate your fund s net asset value the net asset value is a good indicator of whether or not your investment in the fund is retaining its value if you purchased a share of a mutual fund for 50 receive investment income on the fund of 5 each year and maintain a net asset value of 50 each year you will essentially be earning 10 interest on your investment which is a much higher rate than a savings account by following the nav of your fund shares you can monitor whether or not your base investment is retaining its value in addition to bringing in income most investment strategists caution against using the nav to value your investment in the same way you might value an investment in stock using the daily stock price because mutual funds pay out all of their income and capital gains to shareholders besides the management fees charged to operate the fund successful mutual funds don t have to increase their nav over time they instead need to maintain nav while providing interest payments to shareholders adjust your fund investments after assessing the nav and total return performance of your fund investment you may consider whether or not to adjust your investments while mutual funds are considered some of the most secure and diverse investments in stocks some funds focus on specific market areas like tech or healthcare if you feel your specific fund isn t providing the returns you are seeking and you think you can get those returns elsewhere adjust your investments accordingly determine the economic value of a company this is known as the asset based approach for valuing a company this calculation looks at the total assets of a company minus its liabilities this approach is often used when a business is no longer operating and is preparing for liquidation 7 x research source 8 x research source choose your valuation date and use the balance sheet as of that date if necessary restate assets and liabilities to fair market value this means restating the value of the company s assets and liabilities for what they could be bought or sold in the current market this might apply to assets such as inventory capital equipment and property and liabilities such as litigation or warranty accruals include any unrecorded assets and liabilities that are not reflected on the balance sheet but may still impact the company s value for instance any pending litigation that might result in the company needing to make a payment within the next operating cycle 9 x research source include the estimated amount the company may lose subtract liabilities from assets and divide by the total number of common shares to get the nav per share or the company for example suppose a company had 120 million in assets and 100 million in liabilities and 10 million common shares assets minus liabilities equal 20 million net asset value per share equals 20 million 10 million 2 per share evaluate the performance of real estate investment trusts reits reits are corporations that own income producing real estate properties or mortgages and allow investors to purchase shares of stock for all of the properties in the trust you can calculate the book value or the value of the property less accumulated depreciation however calculating the net asset value better reflects the market value of shares in the reit 10 x research source 11 x research source 12 x research source begin with an appraisal of the reit s properties one method is to divide the operating income of the properties revenues minus operating expenses by the capitalization rate which is the expected rate of return on a property based on its income 13 x research source for example if the total operating income of an reit is 200 million and the average capitalization rate is 7 percent the value of the properties would be 286 million 200 million 7 percent 286 million once you have the value of the properties deduct the liabilities such as the mortgage debt still owed to get the nav for example suppose the total mortgage debt and other liabilities in the above example equals 187 million the nav equals 286 million 187 million 99 million divide the nav by the number of common shares suppose there are 30 million shares the nav per share would be 99 million 30 million 3 30 per share the quoted prices per share for the reit should theoretically be close to the nav per share assess the performance of variable universal life insurance policies variable universal life insurance policies are similar to mutual funds they are life insurance policies that gain cash value through investments in several separate accounts the securities can change value with fluctuations in the market since they are sold as units of ownership to policyholders you can evaluate the value of the policy by calculating the nav per unit 14 x research source 15 x research source the process to calculate the investment value of a variable insurance policy is similar to the process used for mutual funds,Finance-and-Business
how to make ach payments,automated clearing house ach payments are an electronic funds transfer from one bank account to another ach payments have been around for over forty years and were developed with the intention of being faster safer and more efficient than the use of paper checks to transfer funds many businesses and government entities have long used ach payments to direct deposit paychecks for instance and they have also gained popularity among individuals as a way to pay taxes and recurring bills setting up ach payments is normally a fairly simple process that said it is helpful to understand how they work the variations and risks involved and the basics of setting up ach payments either through your intended payee or your financial institution,learn the basics of ach the national automated clearing house association nacha was established in 1974 by several u s regional clearing houses the entities that facilitate money transfers between financial institutions 1 x research source ach was essentially an agreement among these organizations to streamline the process of clearing funds for transfer the nacha now estimates that 40 trillion per year passes through the ach network find out how ach transactions work making a paperless payment to your electric company for instance involves electronic transactions between you and your bank the electric company and its bank and the two banks and one of two ach operators which clear the transaction 2 x research source the payment originator you initiates an ach payment with his her financial institution the originating depository financial institution odfi your bank records the ach entry the odfi batches together and sends multiple ach requests to one of two ach operators the chosen ach operator the federal reserve or the clearing house clears the request and transmits it in a batch to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi the electric company s bank the rdfi credits the receiver s the electric company account within 1 2 business days compare ach to alternatives with elements such as paperless transactions clearing of payments between banks and credits to accounts an ach payment has some similarities to wire transfers writing paper checks and credit card charges but it is different from each and has strengths and possible weaknesses vis a vis these alternatives a wire transfer is a direct paperless transaction between payer and payee cutting out the middle man that clears the transaction the wire transfer company such as western union only facilitates the process and charges a fee for it wire transfers are faster happening almost immediately but cost more because of facilitator fees and may run more risk of fraud because the lack of a middle man to clear the transaction if you need to get money to someone right away a wire transfer is still the fastest way to go 3 x research source paper checks follow almost exactly the same process as ach payments but they are physically bundled cleared and exchanged between financial institutions sending a paper check in the mail may seem safer to those who fear online hacking but remember that a paper check has your name address phone number account number and routing number this is more than enough information for a criminal to wreak havoc on your finances 4 x research source if you are debating whether to set up automatic payments by either ach payments or credit card charges your fraud liability level is one factor to consider by federal code your liability for fraudulent credit card charges is 0 while with ach payments or debit card transactions for that matter the maximum liability is 50 if you notify your bank within 48 hours or 500 if you do so within 60 days 5 x research source also keep in mind that if your credit card number is stolen then this can reduce your available funds on the credit card but will not affect your bank account balance however ach debit will affect your bank account and you may end up with a bounced check or not be able to pay your bills if the number is stolen distinguish ach credit payments from ach debit payments there are actually two forms of ach payment you can make you may want to think of them as a push and a pull payment method respectively 6 x research source an ach credit payment is the form most common to online bill paying through your bank you authorize your bank to send payments single or recurring to the designated payee an ach debit payment however is more common to online bill paying through the recipient s website for example setting up automatic payments via your electric company s site essentially you are authorizing the payee to take payments single or recurring from your account ach debits thus require you to provide your account number and routing number to a third party the payee so they can withdraw funds ach credits avoid this potential security risk because such information remains in house with your bank therefore if you have the option of setting up automatic payments for your electric bill either through your bank ach credit or through the electric company s website ach debit there may be less risk to your personal financial information by choosing the former having all of your bill pay information together in one account can also be quite convenient if you need to change or verify anything then it is all in the same place contact your financial institution regarding your access to online bill pay features online bill pay has become a standard feature of bank accounts and is usually free with your account because you are setting up online payments through your own bank you don t have to worry about providing your bank account information if you have multiple accounts with that bank though you ll have to choose which to use for online payments online bill payment interfaces vary by financial institution but there is no reason yours should be anything but intuitive and easy to use if it isn t you may want to shop around for a new bank see if your intended recipient is eligible for ach credit payments via your bank most banks should permit you to make an online payment to virtually any company or individual just as you can write a check to just about anyone likewise just about any potential payee should be able and willing to receive payments from your bank but it cannot hurt to contact them and make sure your online bill pay interface probably has information on common payees credit card companies local utilities etc already on file and ready to go you may have to search or choose your electric company from a list for instance then provide your account number and payment zip code from your electric bill often this is enough to get you started other less common payees or individuals may require additional information to be provided look at your account statements and or contact the company directly to obtain the proper billing information determine if you are making an ach credit or a paperless paper transaction some smaller payees such as perhaps your local water authority and almost certainly individuals may not be set up to receive paperless ach credit payments in this case your bank may actually print up and mail a paper check for you as part of its online bill pay service instead of you remembering to write out and send a check to the water company then what may be happening is that you are authorizing your bank to create and send a check to the water company for you each time payment is due this isn t actually an ach credit payment but you will probably set it up in the same manner as one examine your online billing statements which usually now contain check images you should be able to see the image of the check drawn up by the bank on your behalf to pay the water bill while you ll save on postage please note that these paper checks drawn up for you will have your account and routing numbers on them so they are no more secure in that regard than sending a check yourself many people use online bill pay instead of purchasing paper checks regardless of whether they use an ach credit or their bank account set up recurring payments if desired for your rent payment or electric bill you ll almost certainly want to set up a monthly payment thereby giving yourself one less thing to forget about each month you can set up a recurring ach credit in the same amount at the same time each month which is good for something where the amount due remains steady such as a mortgage payment if your bank is able to receive online statements for your from the payees you designate when available from a payee this is usually an option when you add a new online bill payee you can set up recurring payments in varying monthly amounts for instance you can have your total balance due or minimum balance due for your credit card bill paid automatically each month without you having to take any action if you have multiple automatic payments happening each month keep a close eye on your account balance to make sure you maintain sufficient funds if you have insufficient funds to make an ach credit payment the payment will not be made see if your intended recipient allows ach debit payments call or more likely visit the recipient s website if you are setting up ach debit payments you will more than likely be doing so via signing up on the biller s website most companies of any significant size have embraced online bill payment because it cuts down on their costs think of all the time and staff it takes to open all those envelopes stuffed with paper checks and payment stubs follow the recipient s procedures for setting up ach debits these will naturally vary by recipient but there are some typical features of the process if you are signing up online you will have to provide along with standard information about yourself your bank account and routing number you ll find these numbers along the bottom of your checks if you don t have paper checks you can find your account number on statements or other documents and contact your bank and request your routing number just a reminder when setting up online payments or sending out a check whether voided or active be careful regarding whom you are providing access to your account and routing numbers some security experts recommend that you treat these numbers in the same way you do your social security number so think before you provide them 7 x research source if you are signing up by filling out a form to be mailed faxed or scanned you may have to provide a canceled check which will give the payee your account and routing numbers write void across the middle of the check in bold large letters and in ink keep an eye out for a small test transaction if you are setting up automatic payments for your phone bill you may see an ach debit for a few pennies or even 0 00 from globofone or whatever it may be on your bank statement such a test transaction is the recipient s way of confirming that your information is correct and that it is able to pull funds out of your account set up your payment parameters and wait for your ach debits to begin establish the timing and amounts recurring amount balance due minimum due etc to be withdrawn each month or other time period you may be able to set up automatic notifications by email or text when you have a new bill when a payment is posted etc this is usually a wise choice there may be a delay of up to 1 2 billing cycles before an automatic payment plan takes effect so be prepared to pay another bill or two as you did before make sure you have sufficient funds so that an automatic ach debit does not overdraw your account if the electric company tries to pull out 100 from your account and you only have 80 in it expect to pay overdraft fees with your bank as well as any interest penalties imposed by the payee,Finance-and-Business
how to start building wealth at a young age,you are never too young to start saving and investing people who start investing when they are young are more likely to develop habits that will last a lifetime the earlier you start investing the more money you ll accumulate over time to find additional dollars to invest you might start your own business everyone can find money to invest if they analyze and change their spending habits,start early if you want to accumulate wealth time is the most important factor the longer you save and invest the more likely you are to reach your goals and build sizable wealth you can set aside more money to invest over a long period of time than over a short one that may seem obvious but many people don t fully appreciate how powerful the effect of time can be on accumulating wealth for example if you can afford to save 50 per month starting at age 5 assuming someone begins setting aside money for you by age 65 you will have saved 36 000 50 per month x 12 months per year x 60 years or 50 x 12 x 60 36 000 that doesn t include any earnings on the dollars you invest if you were to begin saving at age 50 you d have to save 200 a month in order to arrive at that same 36 000 by age 65 200 x 12 x 15 years if you start investing early you have more time to make up for any investment losses that will occur in some years investors that start later have less time to make up for any investment losses time will permit your investments to rebound in value the standard and poor s s and p 500 is an index of 500 large stocks from 1928 to 2014 the average annual return has been about 10 while there have been negative returns in some years people who invest over the long term have profited from owning this index of stocks 1 x research source add to your savings frequently the frequency of your contributions e g weekly monthly or yearly has an important impact on your long term success if you have trouble remembering to add to your savings account try setting up an automatic monthly transfer from your checking account e g 100 per month savings is the process of moving funds into a separate bank account you segregate money between a savings account and a personal checking account this process helps ensure that you don t spend the amount you intend to save you can then invest your savings account balance in cds stocks bonds or other types of investments saving money more frequently means you can add less each time you contribute this can make it easier to fit each investment into your personal budget for example starting at age 5 you could save 12 50 per week assuming a 4 week month you could also save 50 per month or 600 per year the total you re investing is the same but it s easier to save smaller amounts more often use compounding when you invest once your funds are in savings move the funds into an investment as soon as possible you ll earn a higher rate of return from an investment when you move money from savings into an investment vehicle take advantage of compounding compounding will make your investments grow faster like a snowball rolling downhill the longer it rolls the faster it grows compounding works faster if you invest more frequently 2 x research source when you compound your investments you are earning interest on interest over time you earn interest on both your original investment and on the prior interest you earned use dollar cost averaging the index value on any investment may be higher or lower in any given year over time however the index has generated average return of about 10 per year you can use dollar cost averaging to benefit from short term declines in an investment s value 3 x research source when you invest using dollar cost averaging you invest the same dollar amount each month dollar cost averaging is typically used with stock and mutual fund investing both of those investments are purchased in shares stock shares or mutual fund shares if the share price goes down you end up buying more shares say for example that you invest 500 each month if the share price is 50 you ll buy 10 shares assume that the share price goes down to 25 the next time you invest 500 you ll purchase 20 shares dollar cost averaging may reduce your cost per share as the share price increases over time a lower cost per share increases your profit let your wealth compound if you invest in bonds compounding is the multiplying effect of interest on interest for stocks compounding is generating earnings on your prior dividends in both cases you should reinvest any interest or dividends your investments earn 4 x research source frequency and time are also important a greater frequency of compounding means you receive and reinvest earnings more often the more often this occurs and the longer you let it continue the more powerful the effect 5 x research source for example let s say at age 25 you start saving 100 per month and you earn 6 interest by age 65 you will have invested 48 000 that money would actually grow to nearly 200 000 however if you compounded the interest monthly over that 40 year period 6 x trustworthy source investor gov website maintained by the securities and exchange commision s office of investor education and advocacy providing free resources about investing go to source in contrast let s say you wait to start saving until you are 40 but decide to save 200 a month at the same 6 interest rate by age 65 you will have invested 60 000 however you will not have as much time for your interest to compound each month the result is that you will have only 138 600 saved for retirement rather than the approximate 200 000 in the earlier example you will have saved more of your money but end up with less after compounding use a savings account or buy a certificate of deposit a savings account gives you access to your money at any time with very low risk this option however offers a low interest rate on your investment 7 x research source a certificate of deposit cd offers a slightly better return but with less flexibility you must leave the money with the bank for a period of time ranging from months to years 8 x research source these investments have several benefits they are easy to set up and they re typically insured for up to 250 000 by the fdic meaning they re very safe 9 x research source the downside is that these investments pay very little interest without much interest you don t generate as much compounded interest as a result cds and savings accounts are suitable only for holding small amounts of money for very short periods of time they may improve as savings vehicles in times of high interest rates smaller banks and credit unions will sometimes offer higher interest rates in order to attract customers away from larger institutions 10 x research source invest in government or municipal bonds when you buy bonds you are loaning money to a government or municipality you can also invest in bonds issued by corporations 11 x research source bonds pay a fixed rate of interest on your investment each year you can reinvest your interest in more bonds and allow compounding to work for you payment of your original investment principal and your interest is based on the credit rating of the issuer government bonds and municipal bonds are often guaranteed by tax dollars that the issuer collects so risk is low a corporate bond s payments are based on the creditworthiness of the corporation a company that generates consistent earnings will have a better credit rating 12 x research source you can buy bonds through your bank or using a financial advisor 13 x research source there is a downside to bonds investing when interest rates are low returns can be small even in times of higher rates bonds usually offer lower returns than stocks bonds however are normally considered less risky than stocks 14 x research source the average return on bonds since 1928 including compounding is 6 7 per year compared to 10 for stocks 15 x research source buy stocks when you buy stocks you are a company owner stock investors are also referred to as equity investors investors buy stocks to earn dividends and to benefit from an increase in the stock s price 16 x research source stocks offer better returns on average than most other types of investments while stocks offer higher returns they also involve more risk the longer you are able to invest in stocks the more time you have to recover from a stock price decrease 17 x research source if the company generates earnings they may elect to pay a share of those earnings as a dividend to stockholders you can purchase stocks by opening a brokerage account you ll be asked to complete a new account form once your account is open you can deposit funds and purchase stock consider using a financial advisor to invest in stocks buying individual stocks is riskier than investing in a mutual fund or etf exchange traded fund invest in a mutual fund a mutual fund is a pool of money contributed to by many investors the funds are invested in securities such as bonds or stocks the mutual fund portfolio can generate bond interest or stock dividend income fund investors may also benefit if a security is sold for a gain 18 x research source mutual fund accounts are easy to open and maintain investors pay fees to the fund for money management you can add to your investment regularly and reinvest your earnings if you choose 19 x research source funds allow you to invest in a variety of stocks and bonds this provides the safety of diversity protecting you against losing money when just a few securities decline in value most mutual funds allow you to invest with a small initial amount and to add small

while you sit on the couch eating doritos it s not at all uncommon for a scheduler to call a shopper and offer an assignment but this should never be expected it s simply not possible for schedulers to call each and every shopper when the time comes to begin your first assignment record it into your log print out the instructions for the shop from the company s website and print the form that you will need to fill out about your experience you will actually fill out the form online in most cases but it s important to review those report forms ahead of time so that you know the questions in advance and can find the answers as you shop it s never fun to have to scramble for information and you may have to repeat the shop at your own expense if you ve forgotten something critical make sure you can afford the out of pocket expense you may need to make a purchase out of your own wallet for an assignment so before you accept it make sure you have the cash if not then look for the many shops that don t require a purchase like banking inquiry shops telephone mystery shops parking shops pricing audits and theater checks you can also find in store demonstrations and merchandising assignments that don t require an out of pocket purchase many companies that offer mystery shopping will also offer these other types of assignments mystery shopping often requires you to buy something and with the delay in pay and factoring in variables such as gas you may find it not worth doing that shop some companies will offer a bonus or travel incentive to compensate for gas mileage while others do not this is where routing can make the difference between a profitable mystery shopping trip and one that you didn t feel was worth your time choose carefully know what to do when mystery shopping each assignment will have its own requirements and each business may have their own set of unique protocol some key things include follow the directions of the assignment to the letter if the directions say purchase a small drink do not order a large one or you may not be paid pay attention to every detail including names of every employee you come in contact with what they are wearing and what the products are like forgetting details could result in not being reimbursed always take notes after each assignment especially if you are visiting more than one place the last thing you want is forgetting details or confusing them companies will reject reports if they suspect this has occurred make every report its own individual story by providing details that are unique to that location and experience and make sure that there is no overlap in your narratives description of events between one shop and another look the part when choosing appropriate attire for an assignment remember that your role as a mystery shopper is to blend in flashy attire and accessories may result in shopper detection think of the average customer of the shop you re going to what might they wear or where are they coming from generally you ll be given tasks according to your demographic if you re a 25 year old female they probably won t send you to a bait and tackle shop this makes it a lot easier to just be yourself and use your own wardrobe act the part if you walk into a camera shop and you ask for err the black one but then rattle off some info about the current camera market and your specific still life photography needs red lights are going to be flashing everywhere don t be obvious you re just shopping don t think of it as pulling the wool over their eyes there will be times when things get awkward you may have to ask several people their names and feign interest in something you wouldn t be caught dead using try to think of it as just a fun experience to widen your world be calm be cool you re just shopping when you re taking notes be discreet the second you whip out a note pad the service will be on you like a pack of blood hungry hounds while you may get served faster you re creating an inorganic unnatural environment don t let them know what you re up to you want to see how the business normally runs be punctual and reliable the task needs to be done at a certain time so it s imperative that you fit it into your schedule in addition make sure your assignment is submitted well before your deadline including written reports receipts and uploading media like photos if you miss your deadline some companies will delete you from their system automatically if you are having a particular challenge make sure to reach out to your scheduler or company contact to request an extension if possible some companies will offer you the chance to reschedule instead of cancelling however their clients give them specific days the tasks must get done and they may not be able to work with you strive for perfection on each and every assignment in general mystery shopping companies are looking for people that have good grammar and punctuation but that also are detail oriented and can express themselves clearly they also need to be very prompt and thorough check spelling punctuation and grammar there are many free spelling and grammar check tools many shoppers find it easy to do a quick spelling and grammar check by copying and pasting their narratives into a word document though know that this isn t always 100 correct this serves two purposes because after completing the spell grammar check you can save that document to retain a copy of your narratives this can come in handy and save you a lot of time if you have a power surge connection issue or get timed out on a reporting server it s also important to retain this information in case questions come up later understand the reporting requirements know if the company wants greetings and closings in a direct quote fashion or if the preference is for paraphrasing do you have to write in first person singular narrative or from a third person objective perspective does the company wants the associates names used in the narrative or do they not want names used at all sometimes clients prefer their employees to be called associates sales professionals or some other designation these reports are for the clients so adhere to those policies and preferences your objective as a shopper is simply to report the objective factual data in many cases however some companies will ask for opinions or feeling statements i e she answered the phone abruptly and spoke so quickly that i wasn t sure i had called the right place she spoke in a disinterested tone of voice and i felt rushed this made me feel unimportant i did not feel valued as a potential customer these instructions are just as important as the shop instructions and may also include formatting preferences media upload requirements and instructions i e receipts and photos or the company s preferences in providing descriptions this information should be available in the instructions for the shop commonly referred to as shop guidelines be honest and clear schedulers and editors like to work with people they can trust to turn in a quality product and you will get more assignments by doing the very best job you can each and every time there is no need to make your experience more remarkable regardless of how it goes you ll still get paid the same amount of money in general each company has a representative working within an area you may have actual interact with the company so be on your best behavior you re not just some computer generated survey taker hand assignments in right after task completion if you are having a particular challenge make sure to reach out to your scheduler generally speaking there is a 24 hour turn around however some clients of your company may require it by the next morning either way there s little time for dilly dallying 6 x research source get paid though it all depends on the company and the assignment you should receive payment via check or paypal within a few weeks time 6 x research source if you do regular work you ll end up with a paycheck two times a month however it may take one to three months to get that paycheck 7 x research source keep track of this legalities may arise so it s best to have complete records once you start making major moolah you ll have to think about taxes so keep everything as organized as

how to prepare a bank reconciliation,a bank reconciliation is a critical tool for managing your cash balance reconciling is the process of comparing the cash activity in your accounting records to the

statement as soon as possible if you have online access to your account your bank statement should be available shortly after that last day of the month when you get the statement note the month end balance your goal is to reconcile any differences between the bank balance and your cash account records 1 x research source this means checking whether each transaction appears both in your own records and on your bank statement in a bank statement debits refer to withdrawals from the bank account and credits refer to deposits to the bank account these definitions are different from how the accounting profession uses these terms if an item appears only in one place the bank statement or your cash account it is a reconciling item your goal is to identify the reason the two records don t match and correct them until they do a bank reconciliation can be thought of as a formula the formula is cash account balance per your records plus or minus reconciling items bank statement balance when you have this formula in balance your bank reconciliation is complete your cash account balance defined as your book balance or balance per book the bank statement balance is the balance per bank the difference between these two balances is due to reconciling items increase the bank balance for any deposits that have not posted also known as deposits in transit there may be a delay between the time you make a deposit at the bank and the time the deposit is posted as an increase to your bank account if you deposit funds at an atm or at the bank branch the delay may be brief if you mail a deposit the delay can be longer 2 x research source you increase your cash account for the amount of the deposit immediately the bank s delay in posting the deposit means that you have a reconciling item the bank statement balance would need to be credited or increased to reflect the true amount of cash for example assume your bank balance was 5 000 you deposited 1 500 on july 31st your july bank statement does not include the 1 500 deposit to reconcile the balance you would add 1 500 to the bank statement balance increasing the bank balance to 6 500 the 1 500 is a reconciling item decrease the bank balance for all outstanding checks a cleared check refers to a check that has posted to the bank s records any check that has not been cleared by the bank is called an outstanding check this situation occurs when checks are written in the last day or two of the month outstanding checks need to be deducted from the bank balance 3 x research source assume that the bank balance is 5 000 to account for deposits properly you increase the bank balance for 1 500 in deposits in transit your change adjusts the bank balance to 5 000 1 500 6 500 say that 5 checks totaling 3 000 are outstanding at the end of the month to account for outstanding checks you decrease the adjusted bank balance by 3 000 your new adjusted bank balance is 6 500 3 000 3 500 make sure to check the prior month s statement as well to ensure that any outstanding checks from the previous period have cleared this month if a check has yet to clear contact the payee the person who should receive the payment to learn why if the check is still outstanding after a month it may be lost check for any errors made by the bank s processing department if you re reconciling a business cash account your accounting is posted to general ledger a business should compare the cash account s general ledger to the bank statement activity you may come across a transaction that you cannot fully explain if you re unclear about a business or personal bank transaction contact your bank 4 x research source one possible error comes from transposing or reversing the numbers on a deposit amount or check for example the bank may mistakenly record a 570 deposit instead of a 750 deposit this always results in an error that is a multiple of nine 180 in this example contact your bank and ask them to make a correction to remove the reconciling item if the discrepancy isn t a bank error it may represent fraudulent activity assume that a secretary manages a dental office the checkbook is on the front desk when the secretary is at lunch a visitor steals a check from the checkbook and cashes it when the check posts to the bank account it is a fraudulent transaction assume also that the dentist notices the cashed check in the bank statement the dentist calls the bank and the bank adds funds back to the account that removes the reconciling item verify that all checks have posted when your company receives the bank statement you should print a report listing all of the checks written and deposits made during the month a company will probably have accounting software that can provide reports if you re reconciling your personal bank account you should review your check register and your deposit slips a company should print the cash reports and also review the check register and deposit slips review all of the checks you have written in numbered order verify that the check posted to your bank statement if the check cleared your bank indicate that in your records you can document the cleared check using accounting software or using a manual report you should also review checks written in the prior month review to see if those checks posted to the current month s bank statement if the check cleared indicate that fact in your records if the check has not cleared contact the payee the check may be lost when you finish your review you should create a list of each check that has not posted to the bank account that list should include the check number the dollar amount and the payee the total dollar amount represents your outstanding checks for the month outstanding checks are a reconciling item confirm that all deposits have posted a business should print a list of all deposits made for the month the company should also review all deposits slips if you re reconciling your personal account you should have a list of deposits in your checkbook along with your deposit slips 5 x research source when you receive your bank statement review the deposits that posted to the bank s records for the month review all of your checkbook deposits in order by date confirm that each deposit posted to the bank statement you should also review any deposits in transit at the end of the prior month confirm that those deposits posted to the bank statement for the current month when you finish your review you should create a list of each deposit that has not posted to the bank account that list should include the deposit amount and the date of the deposit the total dollar amount represents your deposits in transit for the month deposits in transit are a reconciling item subtract any service charges and automated debits you need to deduct all bank charges from your cash account one type of bank charge is a monthly service charge you may also be charged if you overdraw your account balance most of these charges are posted to your bank statement but may not be posted to your cash account at month end you also need to adjust your cash records for interest earned on your bank account balance 6 x research source if a 10 service fee is posted to the bank statement for example it would need to be deducted from the cash account until you post the amount to your cash records it is a reconciling item add any interest earned on your account balance you don t typically know about interest your account has earned until a bank statement arrives add any interest the bank has credited to your cash account balance until you post the interest to your records the amount is a reconciling item deduct any automatic payments many accounts may have automatic monthly payments set up for certain recurring bills if you don t have the payment date for auto payments on your calendar you may not see the withdrawal until it appears on the monthly bank statement review your bank statement post any missing automated debit payments to your cash account this step will remove a reconciling item deduct any nsf checks if the bank statement indicates that a not sufficient funds check bounced during the month that means that the check amount was not deposited to your account you will have to deduct the check amount from your cash account records if the bank charges you a fee for depositing a bad check you will also need to deduct that amount you will also be charged if you overdraw your account check for any errors you ve made during the month as you compare your cash account activity to the bank you may find errors that you made for example you might post the wrong dollar amount for a check or deposit to your cash records those errors will create a reconciling item 7 x research source if your balance is off by a multiple of nine for example 270 or 630 you have likely made a transposition error this means you accidentally switched the order of two digits in a deposit for example you may have filled out a check for 310 but recorded it in your records as 130 once you finish all of your reconciliation work your cash account balance plus or minus all reconciling items should equal the balance per the bank statement if that formula does not equal review your work until you account for all of the reconciling items correctly 8 x research

saying how could you be so stupid or what were you thinking the best way to deal with this type of criticism is simply to ignore it constructive criticism on the other hand usually has a good intention behind it it is intended to help you to improve and should be viewed as a positive an example of constructive criticism would be thanks for your report it was a good effort but i think it could benefit from more statistics to support your findings the best way to handle this type of criticism is to thank the person for their feedback and to use their comments to improve your work in

how to cancel a real estate contract,the details of how a contract is broken are typically specific to the provisions originally laid out in the contract but there are some standard features of real estate contracts which although not true in all cases typically allow you to end a deal that you have made you will need to be very attentive to detail and responsive in ending such a contract real estate contracts are constructed to be strong and often have time provisions that make it nearly impossible to alter the arrangement after a predetermined date,recognize the difference between buyers and sellers if you are in the market to buy a house it should be easy to break off an arrangement with a real estate agent as a seller however you will find that your agent has invested considerable money toward advertising your property and might be disinclined to let you go to maintain a good record of customer service most will allow you to end the relationship but you could encounter some difficulties 1 x research source look for an opt out clause these clauses are common with large national companies they allow you to exchange one agent at the company for another if you have a problem with the individual but are content with the company this is a relatively painless way to rectify the situation 2 x research source other contracts include a termination fee which allow you to void the contract completely for approximately 300 to 500 3 x research source talk to the agent most sellers become dissatisfied with their agent because of a failure in communication it is possible that issues can be resolved in a conversation if not the agent will likely allow you to leave contract discuss whether you want to break the contract with an agent because you have decided not to sell your home or because you are not happy with the service the agent is providing if there are no provisions in the contract for voiding the agreement you will often need to negotiate over a termination fee the agent might ask you to cover the expense of advertising if you do negotiate an early end to the contract be sure to get the agreement in writing that all of the stipulations of the original contract are void oftentimes the original contract will have provisions that would allow the broker to receive commission if you sell the house independent of him 4 x research source wait until the contract is voided if the agent is unwilling to free you from your contractual obligations you can simply wait until the contract is voided most such contracts are valid for no longer than 6 months 5 x research source if you manage to sell the house during the contract period and you have an exclusive right to sell agreement the agent will be owed a commission even if you brokered the exchange without their active involvement but if it is an exclusive agency agreement or an open listing you may not have to pay commission to the broker be sure to review the listing agreement to determine the commission liability most brokerages allow a cancellation of the listing agreement without question if a listing agent has put considerable effort and money into it and the seller wants to cancel before the listing expires then the listing agent may attempt to be reimbursed but if the listing agreement has no mention of that then the seller is not obligated find violations in the contract if the agent is unwilling to release you and you do not want to wait for the contract to expire the only remaining option is prove a breach of contract if you can prove that the agent did not perform tasks that are outlined in the contract you may be able to legally break it 6 x research source this should be a course of last resort because breach of contract will ultimately need to be proven in court it is extremely rare that your agent would be inclined to take you to court over a contract however alleging breach of contract can quickly escalate the situation 7 x research source notify your agent immediately that you plan to withdraw from the contract whether or not you will be able to cancel your contract without substantial penalty to yourself will often be contingent upon how quickly you act the rules for cancellation are generally specific to your particular contract your agent should be familiar with these provisions cancel at will before signing although you have offered a verbal agreement and a bid for the property this is not binding until all parties have signed a contract have your agent or attorney write a formal purchase contract cancellation agreement to the representative of the seller though you should not have paid a deposit at this phase in the process if you have the letter ought to indicate that the money will be returned once the letter is received the contract will be considered void at this point the rescission will state who the deposited earnest money will go to whether it s the buyer or someone else once the seller agrees to the terms of the rescission the buyer should get the earnest money back the letter should include basic identifying information about the exchange including the address of the property the date of the contract and the name of the parties involved review the contract and title report closely ask questions of the title officer if anything is unclear a buyer can choose to cancel a contract with a title contingency in just about any type of sale except for a sheriff s sale buyers should do some advance research about these properties a buyer will typically have 5 days to cancel the contract once they receive it but the contract can stipulate something else for instance make sure the offer states once received if it is only issued to the agent and the agent is out of town for 3 days then you now only have 2 days to review review the contract thoroughly for what the contingencies are protecting you for and make sure the timelines are appropriate before giving it to the seller look for right of rescission provisions in the contract most contracts specify a certain period of time during which the buyer is permitted to void the contract generally the buyer will have 3 days to cancel the contract after receiving the disclosures other rescissions are based on specific contingencies in the contract 8 x research source refuse negotiations in cases where there is some damage to the property or the assessment has come in below the purchase price contingencies kick in and the buyer has the right to request a revision to the contract or rescind if either of these situations occur refuse the negotiations in order to legally get out of the contract for example with an inspection contingency the buyer may request repairs or a reduced purchase price if the seller disagrees the buyer may choose to rescind if you are a seller trying to terminate the contract with the buyer do not allow the requests made by the buyer the buyer can choose to purchase or rescind the offer based on a failed inspection but only the buyer is allowed to cancel the deal at this point and have any earnest money returned if the seller does not do what the buyer wants there is a good chance the contract will be rescinded by the buyer but they could still continue to purchase it and waive the inspection contingency with a low appraisal the buyer has the right to request that the seller lower the purchase price however the seller may refuse in which case the buyer can decide to rescind or pay the extra amount required to make the down payment percentage required as long as the request or rescission was made prior to the contingency expiring use contingencies although they vary with each contract every real estate contract should include some contingencies upon which the buyer is able to void the contract most contracts allow the buyer to conduct a property inspection and ask for revisions of the contract if there is physical damage to the property similarly if you are unable to get funding from the bank or the appraisal determines that the property is priced too high the contract may be rescinded however the buyer still has a right to bring in more money if the appraisal was low as long as they qualify with the lender at the higher purchase price and they have more money to put down the buyer must choose to rescind the contract before it is terminated the buyer will be given a period of time to review the regulations if they checked it off in their offer and the seller accepted it in the offer this is one of the contingencies that are available to all buyers in the case of foreclosures and reo properties a buyer may or may not be allowed any contingencies but generally in a traditional sale a buyer may request this the seller can refuse any contingency in the offer before the contract has been mutually executed keep in mind that the offer was already placed and accepted by the seller there is no offer in place to reject the buyer must use this contingency and rescind the contract if they take objection after reviewing the association rules and other documents requested they are generally issued as a part of the title report but if it is new construction the builder or agent of the builder typically provides them other contingencies that sometimes appear in contracts include inability to find sufficient insurance at the price rate the contingency specifies generally ½ of 1 of the purchase price and the discovery of liens against the property that cannot be cleared called a title contingency be prepared to lose your deposit if you have allowed your contingencies and right of rescission to expire before breaking your contract you may lose the earnest money deposit that you put in escrow the purchase and sale agreement will state what the remedy is if the buyer defaults on the contract typically the earnest money will go to the seller but it can be the seller s choice if that s what is stated 9 x research source though losing the deposit will be painful in some sense it protects you by freeing you of any further obligations the alternative is that the seller can sue for specific performance although rare this would force you to do what you promised in the contract essentially making you go through with the purchase of the property 10 x research source because real estate contracts are generally solidly written those who break them will invariably lose if the case goes to court consult with a lawyer about cancellation if you have decided that you can cancel the contract on acceptable terms you should immediately consult a lawyer or your agent have them void the deal under terms defined by the contract act quickly to save your opportunity to claim contingencies consult your attorney and real estate agent as a seller you have fewer opportunities to cancel a contract than a buyer the consequences of breaking the contract can also be more severe you should immediately seek professional assistance review the contract for a kick out clause these are relatively rare however some contracts include clauses that stipulate that the seller can escape from her contract if she manages to find a buyer willing to pay more for the property such clauses are only valid for a period of time specified in the contract 11 x research source this clause will only however allow you to replace one buyer with another if you have changed your mind about selling the property this clause might not be the escape route you need be attentive to buyer failures often the contract stipulates that the buyer is supposed to fulfill a contingency by a specific date you can use this to your advantage if for example the buyer fails to get financing within a particular time span you can use this as justification to void the contract in order to successfully employ this strategy you ll need to request that the buyer prove that there s a loan commitment in place if the buyer has defaulted on this contingency then the seller can demand a default and termination of the contract if the contingency has passed already the buyer will not be able to use it to rescind and get the earnest money back the seller can demand a two day waiver of financing once the contingency has passed and demand a rescission if the buyer will not waive it a buyer can still buy the property though if they waive the financing they may have someone give them cash to purchase it a seller can only demand a rescission when the buyer is in default of the contract terms be prepared to pay if none of the aforementioned strategies are available to you you will need to offer a financial settlement the buyer has the full legal right to sue you forcing you to sell the house and pay damages however depending on her disposition she might not be inclined to engage in the necessary legal battle you will need to offer a settlement large enough to dissuade her from following such a course of action in these cases the buyer has good standing to sue for specific performance which would compel you to proceed with the sale however such cases often take years and are extremely expensive most buyers would prefer to take a payout you will need to negotiate over a specific sum 12 x research source,Finance-and-Business

how to calculate bank interest on savings,while interest earned on savings deposits may sometimes be simple to calculate by multiplying the interest rate by the principle in most cases it is not quite so easy for instance many savings accounts quote an annual rate yet compound interest monthly each month a fraction of the annual interest is calculated and added to your balance which in turn affects the following months calculation this cycle of interest being calculated in increments and added to your balance continuously is called compounding and the easiest way to calculate a future balance is using a compound interest formula read on to learn the ins and outs of this type of interest calculation,know the formula for calculating the effect of compound interest the formula for calculating compound interest accumulation on a given account balance is a p 1 rn n t displaystyle a p 1 frac r n n t p is the principal p r is the annual rate of interest and n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year a is the balance of the account you are calculating including the effects of interest t represents the periods of time over which the interest is accumulating it should match with the interest rate you are using e g if the interest rate is an annual rate t should be a number fraction years to determine the appropriate fraction of years for a given time period simply divide the total number of months by 12 or divide the total number of days by 365 determine the variables used in the formula review the terms of your personal savings account or contact a representative from your bank to fill in the equation the principal p represents either the initial amount deposited into the account or the current amount that you will be measuring from for your interest calculation the interest rate r should be in decimal form a 3 interest rate should be entered as 0 03 to get this number simply divide the stated percentage rate by 100 the value of n is the number of times per year the interest is calculated and added onto your balance aka compounds interest most commonly compounds monthly n 12 quarterly n 4 or yearly n 1 but there can be other options depending on your specific account terms 1 x research source the standard interest rates for many savings accounts are typically around 1 8 2 x expert source benjamin packard financial advisor expert interview 11 march 2020 plug your values into the formula once you have determined the amounts of each variable insert them into the compound interest formula to determine the interest earned over the specified time scale for example using the values p 1000 r 0 05 5 n 4 compounded quarterly and t 1 year we get the following equation a 1000 1 0 054 4 1 displaystyle a 1000 1 frac 0 05 4 4 1 interest compounded daily is found in a similar way except you would substitute 365 for the 4 used above for variable n 3 x research source crunch the numbers now that the numbers are in it s time to solve the formula start by simplifying the simple parts of the equation this includes dividing the annual rate by the number of periods to get the periodic rate in this case 0 054 0 0125 displaystyle frac 0 05 4 0 0125 and solving the object n t displaystyle n t which here is just 4 1 displaystyle 4 1 this will yield the following equation a 1000 1 0 0125 4 displaystyle a 1000 1 0 0125 4 this is then further simplified by solving for the object within the parenthesis 1 0 0125 1 0125 displaystyle 1 0 0125 1 0125 the equation will now look like this a 1000 1 0125 4 displaystyle a 1000 1 0125 4 solve the equation next solve the exponent by raising the result of the last step to the power of four aka 1 0125 1 0125 1 0125 1 0125 displaystyle 1 0125 1 0125 1 0125 1 0125 this will give you 1 051 displaystyle 1 051 your equation is now simply a 1000 1 051 displaystyle a 1000 1 051 multiply these two numbers together to get a 1051 displaystyle a 1051 this is your account value with 5 interest compounded quarterly after one year note that this is slightly higher than 1000 5 displaystyle 1000 5 that you may have expected when the annual interest rate was quoted to you this illustrates the importance of understanding how and when your interest compounds the interest earned is the difference between a and p so total interest earned 1051 1000 51 displaystyle 1051 1000 51 use the accumulated savings formula first you can also calculate interest on an account to which you are making regular monthly contributions this is useful if you save a certain amount each month and put that money into your savings account the full equation is as follows a p 1 rn nt pmt 1 rn nt 1rn displaystyle a p 1 frac r n nt pmt frac 1 frac r n nt 1 frac r n 4 x research source an easy approach is to separate the compounding interest for the principal from that of the monthly contributions or payments pmt to begin calculate the interest on the principal first using the accumulated savings formula as has been described with this formula you can calculate the interest earned on your savings account with recurring monthly deposits and interest compounded daily monthly or quarterly 5 x research source use the second part of the formula to calculate the interest on your contributions pmt represents your monthly contribution amount identify your variables check your account or investment agreement to find the following variables principal p the annual rate of interest r and the number of periods per year n if these variables are not readily available to you contact your bank and ask for this information the variable t represents the number of years or portions of years being calculated and pmt represents the payment contribution made each month the account value a represents the total value of the account after your chosen time period and contributions the principal p represents either the balance of the account on the date that you will be starting the calculation from the interest rate r represents the interest paid on the account each year it should be expressed as a decimal in the equation that is a 3 interest rate should be entered as 0 03 to get this number simply divide the stated percentage rate by 100 the value of n simply represents the number of times the interest is compounded each year this should be 365 for interest compounded daily 12 for monthly and 4 for quarterly similarly the value for t represents the number of years you will be calculating your future interest for this should be either the number of years or the portion of a year if you are measuring less than a year e g 0 0833 1 12 for one month 6 x research source input your values into the formula using the example of p 1000 r 0 05 5 n 12 compounded monthly t 3 years and pmt 100 we get the following equation a 1000 1 0 0512 12 3 100 1 0 0512 12 3 10 0512 displaystyle a 1000 1 frac 0 05 12 12 3 100 frac 1 frac 0 05 12 12 3 1 frac 0 05 12 simplify the equation begin by simplifying the object rn displaystyle frac r n where possible by dividing the rate 0 05 by 12 this simplifies to a 1000 1 0 00417 12 3 100 1 0 00417 12 3 10 00417 displaystyle a 1000 1 0 00417 12 3 100 frac 1 0 00417 12 3 1 0 00417 you can also simplify by adding one to the rate within the parentheses the equation will now look like this a 1000 1 00417 12 3 100 1 00417 12 3 10 00417 displaystyle a 1000 1 00417 12 3 100 frac 1 00417 12 3 1 0 00417 solve the exponents first solve the figures within the exponents n t displaystyle n t which give 12 3 36 displaystyle 12 3 36 then solve the exponents to simplify the equation to a 1000 1 1616 100 1 1616 10 00417 displaystyle a 1000 1 1616 100 frac 1 1616 1 0 00417 simplify by subtracting the one to get a 1000 1 1616 100 0 16160 00417 displaystyle a 1000 1 1616 100 frac 0 1616 0 00417 make the final calculations multiply the first part of the equation to get 1 616 solve the second part of the equation by first dividing the numerator by the denominator of the fraction to get 0 16160 00417 38 753 displaystyle frac 0 1616 0 00417 38 753 multiply this number by the value of the payment in this case 100 to get the second part of the equation our equation is now a 1616 3875 30 5 491 30 displaystyle a 1616 3875 30 5 491 30 the account value under these conditions would be 5 491 30 displaystyle 5 491 30 calculate your total interest earned in this equation actual interest earned would be the total amount a minus the principal p and the number of payments times the payment amount pmt n t so in the example interest 5491 30 1000 100 12 3 displaystyle interest 5491 30 1000 100 12 3 and then 5491 30 1000 3600 891 30 displaystyle 5491 30 1000 3600 891 30 7 x research source open a new spreadsheet excel and other similar spreadsheet programs e g google sheets allow you to save time on the math behind these calculations and even offer shortcuts in the form of built in financial functions to help you calculate compounding interest label your variables when using a spreadsheet it s always helpful to be as organized and clear as possible start by labeling a column of cells with the key information you ll be using in your calculation e g interest rate principal time n payment type in your variables now fill out the data you have about your specific account in the next column over this not only makes the the spreadsheet easier to read and interpret later it also leaves room for you to change one or more of your variables later on in order to look at different possible savings scenarios create your equation the next step is to type in your own version of the accumulated interest equation a p 1 rn n t displaystyle a p 1 frac r n n t or the extended version which takes into account your regular monthly contributions to the account a p 1 rn nt pmt 1 rn nt 1rn displaystyle a p 1 frac r n nt pmt frac 1 frac r n nt 1 frac r n use any blank cell begin with an and use normal math conventions parentheses as necessary to type the appropriate equation instead of entering variables like p and n type in the corresponding cell names where you have stored those data values or else simply click the appropriate cell while editing your equation use financial functions excel also offers certain financial functions that may help your calculation specifically future value fv may be of use because it calculates the value of an account at some point in the future given the same set of variables you ve now become accustomed to to access this function go to any blank cell and type fv excel should then bring up a guidance window as soon as you open the function parenthesis in order to help you insert the appropriate parameters into your function 8 x research source the future value function is designed with paying an account balance down as it continues to accumulate interest instead of with accumulating savings account interest because of this it automatically yields a negative number counteract this issue by typing 1 fv displaystyle 1 fv the fv function takes similar data parameters separated by commas but not exactly the same ones for instance rate refers to r n displaystyle r n the annual interest rate divided by n this will calculate automatically from within the fv function s parenthesis the parameter nper refers to the variable n t displaystyle n t the total number of periods over which interest is accumulating and the total number of payments in other words if your pmt is not 0 the fv function will assume you are contributing the pmt amount across each and every period as defined by nper note that this function is most often used for things like calculating how a mortgage principal is paid down over time by regular payments for instance if you plan to contribute every month for 5 years nper would be 60 5 years 12 months pmt is your regular contribution amount over the entire period one contribution per n pv aka present value is the principal amount your account s starting balance the final variable type can be left blank for this calculation when it is the function sets it automatically to 0 the fv function allows for you to do basic calculations within the function parameters for instance the completed fv function could look like 1 fv 05 12 12 100 5000 displaystyle 1 fv 05 12 12 100 5000 this would signify a 5 annual interest rate which compounded monthly for 12 months over which time you contribute 100 month and your starting principal balance is 5000 the answer to this function will tell you the account balance after 1 year 6483 70,Finance-and-Business

how to calculate cost increase percentage,as prices increase on many of the things you use in your day to day life it may become necessary for you to calculate that increase for forecasting or accounting purposes to calculate the percent increase of an item or items you just need to know the past and present costs and perform a few simple calculations,recall the previous price of an item the simplest way to locate previous cost data is with your own memory perhaps there is some item at the grocery store or shopping mall that you ve been buying for years at the same price this could be a staple of your weekly grocery shopping trips or a clothing item you buy regularly for example imagine that the price of a gallon of milk has been 2 50 for a number of years this represents the previous price for the purpose of your cost increase calculation check the item s current price if the price of an item you ve purchased in the past has increased you can now calculate a cost increase percentage for the item however you will need the item s current cost first check the store for the current price of the item in question for example imagine that a gallon of milk that has always gone for 2 50 is now priced at 3 50 you can now calculate the cost increase percentage to know just how much you are being charged at the new price in relation to the old price before comparing make sure both values your previous and current values refer to the same product if one is better in some way your costs are not directly comparable 1 x research source research historical cost information in some cases locating previous cost information is not as simple as remembering the former cost of an item for example when comparing costs from long ago to now or finding cost increases on an item you ve never purchased you ll need to locate cost information elsewhere the same is true for cost measures rather than items such as the consumer price index cpi a measure of average consumer prices in the u s or the purchasing power of the u s dollar 2 x research source in these cases you will need to do some online research to locate previous cost figures try typing in the item and year you are interested in along with cost or value to locate cost information for that time for example cost information for various consumer goods from 1900 until the present can be found at http mclib info reference local history genealogy historic prices locate modern cost figures for all historical cost information you locate you will also need a modern figure to compare it with try to locate the closest modern version of whatever item or measure you are comparing make sure to avoid comparing items that are different due to different levels of quality or additional features for example use the most current information from the current year in your calculations 3 x research source understand the percent increase formula the percent increase formula calculates the percent increase in a cost as a percentage of the previous cost written out in full the formula is percent increase new cost previous cost previous cost 100 displaystyle text percent increase frac text new cost text previous cost text previous cost times 100 the 100 displaystyle times 100 at the end converts the difference from a decimal to a percentage 4 x research source subtract the previous cost from the new cost start your calculation by putting your variables into the formula then simplify the part of your equation in parentheses by subtracting the previous cost from the new cost 5 x research source for example if you bought a gallon of milk a month ago for 2 50 and today it is 3 50 subtract 2 50 from 3 50 to get the dollar amount of the change or 1 00 in this case divide the difference by the previous cost your next step is to divide the result of the last step by the previous price this essentially converts the different between the new and old costs to a proportion of the previous cost 6 x research source in the example this would be 1 00 the result of the previous step divided by 2 50 the previous cost the result is 0 40 which is expressed as a number rather than a dollar amount convert the answer to a percentage multiply the answer by 100 to get the percentage increase the result will be the percentage that the previous cost has been increased by to arrive at the new cost 7 x research source in the example this is 0 40 100 displaystyle 0 40 times 100 which is 40 percent so the cost of a gallon of milk has increased by 40 percent between the previous and new costs calculate an increase in your expenses you can use the results of your cost increase calculations to calculate increases in cost for all of your expenses you can then track these increases over time and see if some items are increasing faster or slower than other costs then compare the increases to increases or lack thereof in your income to see whether your pay raises are keeping pace with your cost of living 8 x research source track business expense increases businesses can use cost increase percentages to determine the increases effects on projected or actual profit margins this information can then be used to weigh the savings from a change in suppliers or justify a selling price increase for example if a business sees that the price of one of its inputs to production is rising regularly it may choose to seek an alternative input or supplier of that input alternately the business might choose to raise prices accordingly 9 x research source determine appreciation on collectibles collectibles like vintage cars watches and art might appreciate in value over time this appreciation can be measured using the cost increase percentage calculation process compare previous prices of the collectible with current market prices to assess the increase for example if a watch sold for 100 in 1965 but is now resold on the used market for 2 000 this represents a 1900 percent price increase 10 x research source use the same process for other types of percent increase the same formula and process used to find percent cost increase can be used to perform a number of

how to write an email asking for donations,creating an effective email that solicits contributions requires a tone that creates excitement about your organization the use of email as a medium for fundraising is increasing because the cost is less than mail or phone solicitations and the communication is immediate there are ways to create engaging actionable emails so that you get the results you want plenty of donations,write a strong headline a headline is the first line of an email and functions like a title only about 15 of emails are ever opened so writing a great headline is extremely important for keeping the attention of that 15 and compelling them to keep reading in fact in most email accounts you can read the first line of an email in the field next to the subject so headlines are not only a reason to keep reading an email they are a reason to open one in the first place use active verbs and nouns to grab attention as well as bolding centering and a larger font make the headline short and to the point making the purpose of your email clear from the get go compel the reader to think that reading this email will be useful timely and very relevant to their lives answer the question the reader wants to know what s in it for me 1 x research source your subject line can tease the reader be a call to action be a current events subject or be about a local place or event if your organization is strictly community based a good headline example is new york city challenges state natural gas regulations in court tell everything in the first paragraph get to the point right off the bat readers don t want to be wondering what your email is about halfway through which is a reason they might delete the email without making any donation be very clear in this paragraph what you want the reader to do and why you are sending this email in this first paragraph you should ask the reader for their donation although in person you might want to break it to them gently that you want money emails demand your ask right at the beginning make this request easy to see such as in bold or larger font 2 x research source in your ask tell readers what their money will do if a small amount will do something if not everything tell them for example if 50 will feed 100 children you might get more responses than saying that you need 1 000 to build a hut tell them it s ok to say no statistics shows that more people give when they feel freedom to make the choice about giving rather than feeling pressured to do so 3 x research source explain and describe your cause in this first paragraph so that it s clear that you want the money in order to do something not just get money for the sake of having money use your microcontent wisely microcontent is all the short phrases and subheadings that decorate an email you want to use your microcontent to highlight your main points so that readers who like to scan through the email before reading feel compelled to read the text 4 x research source microcontent includes headings subheadings the subject line and links and buttons use active verbs descriptive adverbs and nouns your goal is to get them to read the actual text a good heading might look like this donate 50 to save a dolphin make them bold or larger text so that they stand out they tend to appear at the beginning of paragraphs or new sections write simple subheadings you may or may not have subheadings but they are useful to include when you feel that a heading is too short follow the same principles short actionable bold tell a story telling a story with your email is more engaging to readers the body of your email will contain this story remember that stories have a beginning middle and end you may want to use an emotionally charged story to compel readers to join your cause financially one that has actually happened within your organization or as a result of your activity write short body paragraphs craft the body of your email in short to the point paragraphs this is because readers are worn down by the sheer amount of emails they receive limiting the length of your email makes you stand out 5 x research source bring in only one or two main points be very concise no matter how many edits and revisions the email needs to go through in order to achieve this don t include the history of why you re asking for money the uses that you give in the opening paragraph and your story in the body paragraphs are sufficient to explain why you need money provide links and buttons but stay on message it may be tempting to add tons of links to your email but this can become a distraction and easily derail the reader from your main message to get a donation an easy way to provide the curious reader with information without adding many distracting links is to have all relevant information on your website then include a link to your website only for instance if there is research proving your statements are true instead of linking directly to a long complicated study for the reader to get lost in have a link to that study on your website and make sure the option to donate is prominent on your website add images carefully you may want to add one or two images to emphasize your point but this is not necessary in fact colors and images can make emails feel like spam 6 x research source try to insert images only at the top or bottom and restrict their use to when you feel an image is absolutely necessary for communicating your point or eliciting sympathy a useful image might be a subject of your charity experiencing the effects of donations like an impoverished little girl receiving new clothes for the first time inserting your logo in an unobtrusive location like a bottom corner can be an exception to this rule as it provides instant reader recognition write a direct next step call to action the final portion of an email is the call to action and making it stand out allows readers to scan it before they read all the reasons why they should donate this serves to inform readers why you re emailing them so that they stay engaged be clear about how to make the donation if a reader doesn t know why they re reading an email they are much more likely to discard an email make sure this final ask stands out from the rest of the email and be very clear about what you are asking for make it have its own paragraph be in bold or larger different font and contain a brightly colored link or donate button if readers have to click the button or link tell them to do so if they have to reply to the email for further instructions tell them to do this is no uncertain terms click the button to save a monkey right now or hit your reply button this very instant and type the phrase donation information into the body it makes more sense to readers to be able to click a link right then and you will likely get more donations this way so try to provide a link or button to your organization set up a website or online donation page so that readers can contribute online this is what readers expect from a donation email anyway keep it short if your email is long it s not easy to scan keeping paragraphs and headings short will ensure that your email gets a proper scan before the reader decides to continue reading or not keep the tone more casual than a letter a formal letter sent in the mail from an organization to an individual is often formal and distant because of the mode of communication 7 x research source however an email like a blog is less formal in its tone use second person you when addressing the reader use familiar expressions to help the reader relate to you like it cost an arm and a leg or he was knee high to a grasshopper use direct honest open language when addressing the reader so that they feel connected and see you as authentic make words easy to read use basic fonts and streamline the visual appeal of the email don t try to use a fancy cursive font just a basic serif font will do and don t use two different fonts for the headings and text simply bolding or making some text larger than others will emphasize points just fine your email should also be easy to read from a language standpoint your writing should be at an 8th grade reading level don t get too wordy or complicated your writing should be clear mistake free no grammar or spelling mistakes and easy to read sign up for an email service if you want to make sure that your emails are being opened or determine what kind of people read your emails more than others you don t have to wait for replies or donations if you sign up for an email service like mailchimp you can measure a whole list of different metrics each time you send an email in order to tailor your emails to your actual readers 8 x research source you can review metrics like click through rates open rates and read reports open rates are especially helpful for determining what subject lines are popular increasing how many people read your emails another reason an email service is helpful is if you regularly send mass emails asking for donations your email provider may become suspicious even cutting you off as a suspected spammer it also takes a lot of time to compile lists break down your send to list to fit the requirements of your email account most email providers set a limit of around 50 recipients per email responding to individuals and dealing with emails that come back from inactive email addresses make sure your list cares about your cause regularly review your email list to make sure you are sending it to people who are more likely to read it especially ensuring that people who have expressed interest are on it your metrics will improve this way and you will waste less time personalize by segmenting use a different tone with different groups of donors for example if you have a group of people who regularly respond to your emails send them an email with a personal tone compile another list of readers you know don t usually open your emails with a less formal tone and have an email with an explanatory tone for first time emails with an email service provider you can also customize individual emails with the names of your addressees like dear henry include data that supports your fundraising to keep your audience engaged you may want to provide them with encouraging data showing them how their money worked or is going to work this information can go in the opening paragraph or the call to action or both people like to give when they know they are already doing good things say thank you after receiving a donation don t forget to send personal thank yous to donors after you receive a donation this is a simple act that can guarantee a repeat donation in the future you want to send this email as promptly as possible look at it as a type of receipt if you get a large amount of donors each month you may want to consider creating a template so that you can paste it into an email draft and quickly customize it don t buy an email list selling and buying a list of email addresses of potential donors is illegal according to the can spam act of 2003 9 x trustworthy source federal communications commission independent u s government agency responsible for regulating radio television and satellite and phone communications go to source there are companies that will allow you to rent a list for one time use but this can be very expensive as you will likely have to buy thousands of email addresses to see even small returns it is probably better to put that money toward something else and look for more solid ways to build your email list collect names at events 10 x research source any time your nonprofit hosts or is involved in an event make sure you provide a way for people to sign up for your email list put out a pen a clipboard and a few sheets of paper with space for interested parties to write their name and email address make sure the paper states that they are signing up for your email list try a raffle or contest to get more names at the event try hosting a raffle or contest for those who sign up to your email list 11 x research source use social networking 12 x research source make sure your nonprofit has a strong presence in social media from twitter to facebook to instagram it is easy to reach people through social media and if you have compelling content people may begin sharing your posts or calls for donations ask your followers to sign up for your email list so they never miss an important announcement make it easy your website should give visitors the opportunity to sign up for your email list it doesn t need to be flashy but it should be easy to find and sign

how to calculate intrinsic value,many analysts believe that the market price of a particular stock does not represent the true value of the company these analysts use intrinsic value to determine if a stock s price undervalues the business there are four formulas that are widely used for the calculation the formulas consider the cash and earnings generated by the firm and the dividends paid to shareholders,look at your investment choices intrinsic value is used to measure the true value of an investment so it s important to understand the basics of investing a company has two ways to raise money to run the business they can issue stock or bonds companies issue common stock by selling ownership in the business when you buy stock you are an owner investor in the business your shares of stock represent a small percentage of ownership in the company 1 x research source a bond represents a company debt investors who buy bonds are considered business creditors the bond owner receives interest income on the bond investment usually twice a year the original amount invested is returned to the bond investor on the maturity date 2 x research source consider how a business becomes profitable intrinsic value is based on the ability of a business to generate cash flow into the company and earn a profit when a company s revenue or sales are higher than their expenses the firm generates earnings 3 x research source for this discussion you can think of earnings and profit as the same thing companies must use cash to buy inventory make payroll and advertise that type of spending is considered a cash outflow when customers pay for a product or service the business has a cash inflow the ability to generate more cash inflows than outflows over time indicates a valuable company 4 x research source choose an investment option investors have hundreds of investment choices a bond investor for example expects a certain amount of interest income a stock investor is interested in seeing the value of stock increase over time or in receiving a share of the earnings in the form of dividends the intrinsic value formulas make assumptions about an investor s required rate of return you can think of this return as the investor s minimum expectation if the investment cannot meet the expectation it s assumed that an investor would not invest 5 x research source understand the definition the dividend discount model ddm considers the dollar value of dividends paid to shareholders this model also factors in a projected growth rate of the dividend dividends are discounted to their present value using a discount rate if the dividend discount model values the stock at a higher price than the current market value the stock s price is considered to be undervalued the ddm formula is dividend per share discount rate dividend growth rate 6 x research source consider the growth rate for dividends a dividend is a payment of a company s earnings to shareholders if a company s earnings are expected to grow an analyst may also assume that the dividends paid to shareholders may grow you should assume a growth rate for the ddm formula 7 x research source say for example that your company has earnings for the year of 1 000 000 you decide to pay 500 000 to shareholders in the form of a dividend if your firm had 500 000 shares of common stock outstanding you would pay a 1 dividend on each share of stock assume that the company earns 2 000 000 in the following year the firm may decide to pay a larger dollar amount as a dividend say 1 000 000 if the number of common stock shares is still 500 000 each share of stock would receive a 2 dividend apply a discount rate the discount rate is the percentage rate used to discount future payments into today s dollars discounting payments to the current day allows the analyst to make a apples to apples comparison of cash flows from different periods of time 8 x research source remember that for this formula the discount rate is the rate of return required by the investor it should take into account the stability of the dividend payment for example if the dividend payment is erratic the discount rate should be higher assume that you expect to receive a 100 payment in five years assume also that the discount rate each year will be 3 9 x research source you can use a present value table to determine the present value factor for 100 received in 5 years at a discount rate of 3 the factor is 86261 other tables or calculators may be slightly different due to rounding 10 x research source the present value of the payment is 100 multiplied by 86261 86 26 input your assumptions into the ddm formula the ddm formula is dividend per share discount rate dividend growth rate dividend per share is the dollar amount of dividend paid for each share of common stock assume the dividend is 4 per share the discount rate is the investor s required rate of return assume a 12 discount rate assume a 4 percentage rate of dividend growth each year the ddm formula is 4 12 4 50 if the current market price of the stock is less than 50 per share the formula indicates that the stock price is undervalued in other words the intrinsic value of the stock is higher than the stock s current price analyze the concept of dividend growth in perpetuity many companies grow their sales and earnings over time if earnings grow the firm has the option of paying more earnings to shareholders as a dividend the gordon growth model makes an assumption that dividends will grow at a specific rate forever 11 x research source the formula is expected dividend per share one year from today investor required rate of return growth rate in dividend in perpetuity understand that a business can pay earnings as a dividend to shareholders or can keep the earnings for future business use earnings kept by the company are referred to as retained earnings a company s balance in retained earnings is the sum of all earnings less all dividends paid since the business started 12 x research source make some assumptions for the variables in the formula assume the company s expected dividend per share one year from now is 5 decide on an expected rate of return required for an equity stock investor of 10 make an assumption that the annual dividend growth rate in perpetuity is 2 use the formula to calculate intrinsic value the gordon growth model would be 5 10 2 62 50 62 50 is the intrinsic value of the stock using this model if the current market price of the stock is less than 62 50 the model indicates that the stock is undervalued look at book value per common share book value is defined as a company s assets liabilities it can also be defined as a firm s equity if a company sold all of the assets and used the available cash to pay off all remaining liabilities any cash left over would be considered equity book value 13 x research source understand the concept of residual value a company has book value as a starting point the formula then adds new expected earnings that the company generates over and above a required rate of return you re adding extra value to the existing book value of the stock if the company can grow earnings at a faster rate than required the firm will be more valuable if the calculation s intrinsic value is more than the current market value the stock is undervalued add in residual value the formula for residual value has two components it is the current book value of the equity plus the present value of future residual income 14 x research source for example suppose a company will earn 1 00 per share forever and the company also pays out all of this as dividends 1 00 per share the equity capital invested book value is 6 00 per share because the earnings and dividends will offset each other the future book value of the stock will always stay at 6 00 the required rate of return on equity or the percent cost of equity is 10 percent calculate the annual residual income with the formula rit et rbt 1 displaystyle ri_ t e_ t rb_ t 1 where rit displaystyle ri_ t residual income in future periods r displaystyle r required rate of return on equity et displaystyle e_ t net income during period t displaystyle t if the net income is 1 00 per year the book value is always 6 00 and the required return is 10 percent the the annual residual

current book value plus the present value of future residual income the equation is 6 00 4 00 10 00 displaystyle 6 00 4 00 10 00 the intrinsic value is 10 00 learn the formula the formula for the discounted cash flow method is pv cf1 1 k cf2 1 k 2 displaystyle pv cf_ 1 1 k cf_ 2 1 k 2 tcf k g 1 k n 1 displaystyle tcf k g 1 k n 1 15 x research source pv displaystyle pv present value cfi

displaystyle n the number of years in the period including the terminal year to understand the formula you need to understand free cash flow capital expenditures and weighted average cost of capital consider free cash flow free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures operating cash flow is the cash inflows and outflows from your day to day business that includes buying inventory making payroll and collecting cash from customers 16 x research source a capital expenditure represents your spending on fixed assets such as machinery and equipment think about the assets you will use in your business over a period of years successful companies are able to generate most of their cash from operations if you manufacture and sell denim jeans for example selling jeans should be your primary sources of cash if you have free cash flow you have the flexibility to spend cash on areas that can grow your sales and earnings if a competitor s business was up for sale for example a firm could use their free cash flow to buy the operation and expand the company go over weighted average cost of capital wacc capital represents money you raise to run your business if you issue stock to investors they will expect some rate of return on their equity investment bond investors want an interest rate paid on their bond investment 17 x research source issuing bonds debt and stock equity comes with a cost we refer to that cost as the cost of capital if the profit you expect to generate on a project is more than the cost of capital it makes financial sense to raise capital for a project the discounted cash flow method uses wacc in the formula plug in assumptions to the discounted cash flow dcf formula consider the valuation of sun microsystems in 2012 it was traded at 3 25 but the long term growth rate was estimated to be 13 percent this means the stock was valued at 5 50 making the 3 25 price a very good deal 18 x research source changes in the growth rate and interest rates have a huge impact on valuation,Finance-and-Business
how to write a change management plan,there are two types of change management plans one addresses the impact of change on an organization easing the transition the other tracks changes to a single project creating a clear record of product tweaks or alterations to the project scope both of these plans aim to communicate what needs to be done clearly and accurately,demonstrate the reasons for the change list factors that led to the decision to change such as performance gaps new technology or a shift in the organization s mission one approach is to describe the current situation of the organization and the future situation this plan intends to create 1 x research source define the type and scope of change briefly describe the expected nature of the change management project

example 13 x research source team member fills out a change request form and sends it to the project manager project manager enters form into the change request log and updates this log as requests are implemented or rejected manager assigns team members to write a more specific plan and to estimate the effort required project manager sends plan to the project sponsor for approval or rejection change is implemented stakeholders are informed of progress frequently create a change request form the following data should be included with every change request and entered in the changelog 14 x research source date of change request change request number assigned by the project manager title and description submitter name email and phone number priority high medium or low urgent change management plans may require specific deadlines 15 x research source product and version number for software projects add additional information to the changelog the changelog must also track decisions and implementation besides the information copied from the change request form you ll need space for the following mark of approval or rejection signature of the person approving or rejecting the request change implementation deadline change completion date track major decisions in addition to the day to day changelog the project may benefit from a record of major decisions this record may make it easier to track long term projects or projects that undergo leadership changes this record can also guide communication with clients or senior management for each change in

how to calculate npv,in the business world net present value or npv is one of the most helpful tools available for financial decision making 1 x research source usually npv is used to estimate whether a certain purchase or investment is worth more in the long run than simply investing an equivalent amount of money in a savings account at the bank while it s often used in the world of corporate finance it can also be used for everyday purposes generally npv can be calculated with the formula npv p 1 i t c where p net period cash flow i discount rate or rate of return t number of time periods and c initial investment alternatively calculate the present value of your expected profits then subtract your expenses cash outflow to calculate nvp for a given period,determine your initial investment this is c in the above formula in the world of business purchases and investments are often made with the goal of earning money in the long run these sorts of investments usually have a single initial cost typically the cost of the asset being purchased 2 x research source for example let s imagine that you operate a small lemonade stand you are considering buying an electric juicer for your business which will save you time and effort compared to juicing the lemons by hand if the juicer costs 100 then that 100 is your initial investment determine a time period to analyze this is t in the above formula as noted above businesses and individuals make investments with the goal of making money in the long run to determine the npv for your investment you ll need to specify a time period during which you re trying to determine whether the investment will pay for itself this time period may be measured in any unit of time but for most financial calculations the unit of measure is years 3 x research source in our lemonade stand example let s say that you ve researched the juicer you intend to buy online according to most reviews the juicer works great but usually breaks after about 3 years in this case you ll use 3 years as the time period in your npv calculation to determine whether the juicer will pay for itself before it s likely to break estimate your cash inflow for each time period this is p in the above formula you ll need to estimate how much money your investment will make you during each time period for which it s earning you money these amounts or cash inflows can be specific known values or they can be estimates 4 x research source in the latter case companies and financial firms sometimes devote a great deal of time and effort to getting an accurate estimate hiring industry experts analysts and so on let s continue with our lemonade stand example based on your past performance and your best future estimates you assume that implementing the 100 juicer will bring in an extra 50 the first year 40 the second year and 30 the third year by reducing the time your employees need to spend juicing and thus saving you money on wages in this case your expected cash inflows are 50 in year 1 40 in year 2 and 30 in year 3 determine the appropriate discount rate this is i in the above formula in general a given amount of money is worth more now than it is in the future this is because the money you have today can be invested in an interest earning account and gain value over time in other words it s better to have 10 today than 10 one year in the future because you can invest your 10 today and have more than 10 in a year this concept is called the time value of money for npv calculations you need to know the interest rate of an investment account or opportunity with a similar level of risk to the investment you re analyzing this is called your discount rate and is expressed as a decimal rather than a percent 5 x research source in corporate finance a firm s weighted average cost of capital is often used to determine the discount rate in simpler situations you can usually just use the return rate on a savings account stock investment etc that you might put your money in instead of making the investment you re analyzing in the lemonade stand example let s say that if you don t purchase the juicer you ll invest the money in the stock market where you feel confident that you can earn 4 annually on your money in this case 0 04 4 expressed as a decimal is the discount rate we ll use in our calculation discount your cash inflows next you ll weight the value of your cash inflows for each time period we re analyzing against the amount of money you ll make from your alternate investment in the same period this is called discounting the cash flows and is done using the simple formula p 1 i t where p is the amount of the cash flow i is the discount rate and t represents time 6 x research source you don t need to worry about your initial investment yet you ll use this in the next step in the lemonade example you re analyzing 3 years so you ll need to use your formula 3 times calculate your yearly discounted cash flows as follows year one 50 1 0 04 1 50 1 04 48 08 year two 40 1 0 04 2 40 1 082 36 98 year three 30 1 0 04 3 30 1 125 26 67 sum your discounted cash flows and subtract your initial investment finally to get the total npv for the project purchase or investment you re analyzing you ll need to add up all of your discounted cash flows and subtract your initial investment 7 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source the answer you get for this calculation represents your npv the net amount of money that your investment will make compared to the alternative investment that gave you the discount rate in other words if this number is positive you ll make more money than if you had spent it on an alternative investment such as the hypothetical 4 you would have earned in the stock market above if it s negative you ll make less money for the lemonade stand example the final projected npv value of the juicer would be 48 08 36 98 26 67 100 11 73 determine whether or not to make the investment in general if the npv for your investment is a positive number then your investment will be more profitable than putting the money in your alternate investment and you should accept it if the npv is negative your money is better invested elsewhere and your proposed investment should be rejected note that these are generalities in the real world much more usually goes into the process of determining whether a certain investment is a wise idea 8 x research source in the lemonade stand example the npv is 11 73 since this is positive you ll probably decide to buy the juicer note that this doesn t mean that the electric juicer only made you 11 73 in fact this means that the juicer made you the required return rate of 4 annually plus an additional 11 73 on top of that in other words it s 11 73 more profitable than your alternative investment calculate the value of your company s profits over a given period with a pv equation in many situations you ll need to take recurring expenses into account such as the cost of goods or maintenance expenses in these situations start by using the following equation to calculate your profits for a given period of time pv fv 1 r n displaystyle pv fv 1 r n here pv present value fv is the future amount you hope to make in a given period r is the rate of return or interest rate and n is the number of periods you ll be looking at 9 x research source for example imagine if you re hoping to make 2000 over 10 years with a rate of return of 3 the present value of this amount of money would be 2000 1 03 10 1488 18783 displaystyle 2000 1 03 10 1488 18783 or about 1488 19 add up your expected expenses to find your cash outflow to get a more accurate picture of your present value consider the various expenses you might need to pay for instance you might need to pay for maintenance supplies or fees associated with running your business tally up these expenses to determine your cash outflow over the period in question 10 x research source for example say you need to invest 150 in a piece of equipment for your home business then pay 50 in maintenance on it every 5 years your cash outflow for a period of 10 years would be 150 50 50 250 subtract the cash outflow from the present value to find the npv your net present value is the difference between the present value and your expected cash outflow or total expenses for the period for example 11 x research source if your pv is 1488 19 and you expect your cash outflow to be 250 then your npv 1488 19 250 1238 19 compare investment opportunities by their npv finding the npvs for multiple investment opportunities allows you to easily compare your investments to determine which are more valuable than others in general the investment with the highest npv is the most valuable because its eventual payout is worth the most in present dollars because of this you ll usually want to pursue the investments with the highest npvs first assuming you don t have enough resources to pursue every investment with a positive npv 12 x research source for instance let s say that we have three investment opportunities one has an npv of 150 one has an npv of 45 and one has an npv of 10 in this situation we d pursue the 150 investment first because it has the greatest npv if we have enough resources we d pursue the 45 investment second because it s less valuable we wouldn t pursue the 10 investment at all because with a negative npv it will make you less money than investing in an alternative with a similar level of risk use pv fv 1 i t to find present and future values using a slightly modified form of the standard npv formula it s possible to quickly determine how much a present sum of money will be worth in the future or how much a future sum of money is worth in the present simply use the formula pv fv 1 i t where i is your discount rate t the number of time periods being analyzed fv is the future money value and pv is the present value if you know i t and either fv or pv it s relatively simple to solve for the final variable 13 x research source for instance let s say we want to know how much 1 000 will be worth in five years if we know that at bare minimum we can get a return rate of 2 on this money we ll use 0 02 for i 5 for t and 1 000 for pv and solve for fv as follows 1 000 fv 1 0 02 5 1 000 fv 1 02 5 1 000 fv 1 104 1 000 1 104 fv 1 104 research valuation methods for more accurate npvs the accuracy of any npv calculation basically depends on the accuracy of the values you use for your discount rate and your future cash inflows if your discount rate is close to the actual return rate you can get on your money for an alternative investment of similar risk and your future cash inflows are close to the amounts of money you ll actually make from your investment your npv calculation will be right on the money 14 x research

how to write a briefing paper,a briefing paper outlines a particular issue and its background usually for a government official or other policy maker these decision makers have to make hard choices about many different topics every day and they do not have time to research each one in depth a briefing paper helps bring a single issue to someone s attention and fills in key details he or she

paper how much detail will you go into how many different topics will you cover this will vary based on how much information you re able to find as well as how much information you ll need to include in order to support your claims determining the scope of the briefing paper is important because it will allow the reader to know exactly what information is covered and what is not know your audience before you begin writing your briefing paper it is important to consider who will be reading it this will drive the choices you make throughout the document before you start think about the following questions and if you don t know the answers try to find out 1 x research source 2 x research source who will read this paper government officials business executives journalists some combination of these how much does the audience already know about this issue do they know anything at all what does the audience need to know what authority does the audience have over the issue what changes are he she they capable of making plan out key points before you get started writing your briefing paper you should map out either mentally or in an outline the key points you want to make because a briefing paper is typically only a page or two long it needs to be condensed policy makers are very busy and yours is not the only issue on their plates there s no room for unnecessary information or long winded explanations decide on your key points in advance to craft a concise briefing paper 3 x research source consider using a template while the formatting of a briefing paper isn t overly complex you can save yourself some time by downloading one of the many free online templates for creating briefing papers in ms word 4 x trustworthy source state of oregon official website for the state of

the paper was submitted the subject line should describe in a few words the main topic of the briefing paper such as the prevalence of bullying in the north county school district this lets the reader know without even skimming the document the issue that will be addressed consider a summary section some briefing papers include a summary section at the start of the paper summarizing the entire paper in a few bullet points decide whether you d like to do this and if so set aside space for this section 6 x research source for a very busy reader the summary offers the key points in advance thus allowing skimming over of the rest of the document a well crafted briefing paper is often concise enough that this section is unnecessary however for issues that require immediate action this can be a way to highlight the urgency of the paper by clearly indicating the deadline within the summary the summary should be no more than three to four bullet points craft an opening that summarizes the issue the next part of the paper must describe the issue or problem in some detail start with a brief opening usually labeled issue or purpose that describes in a sentence or two the main issue the paper focuses on and or why you are submitting this paper 7 x research source for example you might write something like violent incidents related to bullying are on the rise in schools within the north county school district current disciplinary policies may not be adequate for addressing this issue outline the key facts background the next section labeled considerations or background should provide some detailed information about the state of the problem or issue focusing on the recent development and or current state of the situation 8 x research source this section should include the information necessary for the reader to make a decision about this issue information not necessary for this purpose however interesting it may be should be excluded if you haven t already do some research before writing this section you want the information in section to be as accurate specific and up to date as possible 9 x research source when necessary translate the information for your audience to make this section clear and simple avoid jargon technical language or information that isn t of central concern to the audience 10 x research source use statistics and data as appropriate but explain things in terms that your audience will be able to quickly and easily understand keep your opinions out your views on this situation and or what should be done about it should not appear in this section keep it strictly factual you may however choose to discuss the pros and cons of various proposed or current actions highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each 11 x research source make it relevant your briefing paper should wrap up with sections labeled conclusion and or recommendations or next steps this closing should make it clear why this issue should be considered important by your reader 12 x research source try to link the issue directly to the reader s self interest to make your paper more persuasive for example you might say something like bullying related incidents are leading parents to consider private school options they are linked to lower test scores and graduation rates making our schools appear less effective in the eyes of the community they reduce our district s opportunities to supplement funding with federal and private grants propose a solution many briefing papers will provide a proposed solution to the issue that has been described linking the issue to a policy change aimed at improving the situation some briefing papers will outline the proposed solution s in a section labeled recommendations but some writers prefer next steps believing this has a softer feel that is less presumptuous or aggressive 13 x research source remember that the reader will be the one who makes the final decision on this issue not you this section need not be balanced as the background considerations section was this can be a place for you to express your view as to what should be done it should be noted however that you do not have to endorse a particular solution you can also just lay out some options with their pros and cons and simply urge the reader to consider these choices and take action of some kind to address the issue you don t necessarily specify which action would be most appropriate use the facts to back your argument your proposals in this final section should flow logically from the information presented in previous sections use the facts you have laid out to show why the solution you are proposing is a good one 14 x research source make sure any solution you propose is clear and directly related to the issue as you have outlined it 15 x research source for example imagine you have highlighted the lack of bullying prevention programs in your previous section here it will make sense to suggest such a program and perhaps point to their effectiveness at other schools if prevention programs haven t already come up a solution like this may feel like it came out of nowhere cut it down a briefing paper should only be about two pages if after you are done the paper is longer than this your first pass through for editing purposes should look for places to cut it down 16 x research source look for information that is off topic or less important and remove that material especially if it doesn t relate to the solution s you offer by the same token make sure there aren t key pieces of information missing that are necessary to make your argument clear and convincing you may need to swap out one piece of information for another try to put yourself in the shoes of a politician or bureaucrat as you edit think about how many pieces of information these individuals receive every day don t contribute to the problem be part of the solution by providing the information necessary to make a decision no more no less remove technical language as you edit keep an eye out for technical language or jargon that could make your paper less accessible even if you sought to avoid this in writing the paper it s possible that some challenging language made its way into the document especially if you are an expert on a topic you are writing about it s easy to forget at least momentarily that language that is every day for you may be difficult for others to understand 17 x research source keep in mind that it is likewise not always immediately obvious why something is important to people who aren t already familiar with a topic policy makers usually can t be experts on every topic they have to make decisions about make sure the structure is logical ensure that the key facts you have included flow logically from the issue as you have summarized it be doubly certain that any solutions you propose address those key considerations as well 18 x research source carefully proofread after dealing with the length and flow of the paper give it one more careful look to ensure that it is free of all errors 19 x research source a paper with spelling style or grammatical errors may be taken less seriously by your reader you may be doing more harm than good by submitting such a paper as it may discredit your perspective,Finance-and-Business

aren t in school consider signing up for a community college or online class to learn something new like cooking or marketing you can also seek out activities that are fulfilling in similar ways to your favorite games for instance playing paintball instead of a shooter style video game or trying out tabletop rpgs instead of computer rpgs set a timer to prevent yourself from binging a game in one session it s easy and fun to keep powering through a game as the hours pass by before you know it it s 5am and you ve already beat your brand new game if you avoid binging it will take longer for you

platform for gaming check your recent purchase history if you see a long list of games that you haven t touched yet close out and don t buy that new game resell or trade in games and use that money to buy new ones if you buy physical games you can save a lot of money by reselling the ones you finish on ebay in a gaming community or through another platform then use that money to buy new games you can also trade your games in at local gaming stores for store credit and use that to buy games 8 x research source consider checking out the used games section of your local gaming store or on ebay to save money on games these games may not be new but they re new to you save up for games that you really want instead of buying cheap games it s hard to stop yourself from buying new games when they re on sale the price seems like such a good deal eventually you end up with a bunch of subpar games that you re not all that interested in playing get more bang for your buck by only allowing yourself to buy games that you re really excited about 9 x research source research games first to make sure they re really worth your money purchases feel more meaningful when you re selective about what you buy avoid new launches and wait for the better and cheaper version the anticipation hype and online chatter surrounding a new launch is easy to get swept up in keep in mind that most new games are pretty flawed when they first come out if a game sells well the makers usually release an improved version of the game with bonus material and other goodies about 6 months later the price tag for this is a lot cheaper 10 x research source after a game launches creators quickly revamp the game after getting feedback from users and usually try to get the re release out that same year limit your time on digital gaming platforms digital gaming platforms like steam are very convenient but you never really own anything you buy on these platforms you don t have physical copies of the games you can t trade them in or resell them and digital versions usually have fewer bonus goodies 11 x research source if you can t resist buying digital games wait for a seasonal sale steam usually has sales around halloween and christmas avoid buying copies of games to play on different platforms it can be hard to resist buying an old favorite when the game is re released on a new platform and has updated features you may love a certain game but do you really need to play it on every device or console for example over the years final fantasy iii has been released on playstation gameboy advance and ps vita to name a few keep in mind that you can always play the original version and borrow the updated version from a friend 12 x research source,Finance-and-Business

how to prepare for a financial crisis,the prospect of a looming financial crisis is a scary thought especially since it s basically impossible to predict when the next downturn will happen and what it will look like however preparing for a possible financial crisis doesn t necessarily mean you have to do without little treats and everyday luxuries looking after your financial health and well being when the economy is strong will help you weather the storm when the next crisis hits 1 x research source,create a household budget and spending plan if you haven t already done so a household budget will help you track your spending and understand where your money goes each month by allocating specific amounts to each type of expense you can control your spending and increase the amount of money you save 2 x research source for example if you spend an average of 100 on groceries each week you might allocate 400 per month to groceries if you think you can reduce that amount you might decide instead to budget 80 per week for groceries and identify items that you don t need such as soft drinks or snack foods prioritize your expenses and create other strategic budgets that you can switch to if your financial circumstances change for example you might spend 20 a month on music streaming services that you could cancel to create more room in your budget if things got tight make strategic budgets for different possible financial situations strategic budgets allow you to rework what will happen with your budget and spending if your financial situation changes working through different scenarios in advance gives you a sense of control so if something does happen it s less scary and stressful because you already have a plan to deal with it 3 x research source for example if you and your partner both work you might create 2 different strategic budgets to figure out what happens if either of you loses work you might also get together additional information or documents related to a strategic budget for example if you re working on a strategic budget in which you re laid off from work you might find out what you would have to do to apply for unemployment and how much you might expect to receive in benefits set up automatic transfers to a savings account include savings as an expense in your budget then use automatic transfers to save that money on a regular schedule so you don t have to think about it if it s already a part of your budget you shouldn t have to worry about dipping into savings to pay bills 4 x research source for example suppose you ve budgeted 400 a month in savings you might set up an automatic transfer of 100 a week on payday some banks have features that allow you to set up a minimum balance for your account and arrange for any amount above that minimum that remains at the end of the month or another period you choose to automatically be transferred to savings build an emergency fund to cover expenses for 4 6 months experts recommend that you keep enough in savings to cover 6 months worth of expenses but if that s out of reach for you try to save at least 4 months it might take some time but you ll get there eventually even if you aren t able to save the full amount a little is still better than nothing don t shrug off an emergency fund just because it seems like it ll take too long to accumulate the total you re supposed to have 5 x research source for example if your expenses total 2 000 a month you re looking at having an emergency fund of 8 000 to 12 000 if you re only able to save 200 a month it ll likely take you 3 to 4 years to build up that fund assuming you don t need to use any of that money in the meantime keep in mind that emergency funds are meant to be used they re not long term savings don t save your emergency fund in an account that you can t access immediately whenever you need it including situations such as car repairs or unanticipated medical expenses open a savings account at a different bank to diversify your accounts if you already have a good amount of money saved moving part of your savings to a different bank can help you in a financial crisis if banks start to fail put at least a third of your savings in a bank that s too big to fail such as a large international bank to protect and diversify your savings 6 x research source if you have significant savings avoid keeping more in any one account than can be ensured the fdic federal deposit insurance corporation protects up to 250 000 in principal and interest from loss 7 x research source keep enough cash at home in a safe to cover 1 2 weeks of expenses in a large scale financial crisis it s possible that banks could go down and your debit or credit cards might not work however stores and service providers will still take cash if you have enough on hand to cover expenses for a week or two you ll still be able to fulfill basic household needs 8 x research source any cash you keep at home isn t earning any interest so you don t want to have too much set aside however it s still a good idea to keep at least a few hundred to a thousand dollars in a safe so you re prepared if you can t access your savings and other money check your credit report and score at least once a year in the us you can get free copies of your credit report from all 3 major credit bureaus once a year by visiting https www annualcreditreport com while these free reports won t include your score you can use a free app or online service such as wallethub credit karma or nerdwallet to monitor your score 9 x trustworthy source usa gov official website for the united states federal government go to source if you have a consumer credit card you might also have access to your credit score through your credit card company many have credit monitoring programs you can use for free if you re a cardholder when a financial crisis hits you might end up needing to borrow money having a good understanding of your credit score and what s on your credit report can help you get the best possible terms on a loan clean up any errors on your credit report when you check your credit report if you see any items that are incorrect or unfamiliar contact the credit bureaus and dispute the item getting errors removed from your credit report will improve your score 10 x research source the federal trade commission ftc has a sample dispute letter that you can use to dispute errors you can also dispute errors with the credit bureaus on their websites if you see the same error on 2 or 3 reports you have to dispute it with each of the credit bureaus separately getting the error fixed on one report doesn t mean it ll get fixed on the others if you have an ongoing relationship with the lender responsible for the mistaken entry file your dispute with them instead of with the credit bureau pay down or eliminate high interest debt high interest debt on consumer credit cards becomes even more expensive once a financial crisis hits while the economy is relatively stable total your high interest debt and work to pay it off 11 x research source for example suppose you owe 10 000 on 2 credit cards 2 000 on a card with a 17 interest rate and 8 000 on a card with a 12 interest rate pay as much as your budget allows on the card with the higher interest rate and the minimum payment on the other card once the first card is paid off roll that same payment amount over to the other card and get rid of it another strategy involves eating away at the larger balance first then paying off smaller balances this makes sense if all of your interest rates are within 1 2 points of each other if you have any small balances that you can pay in full all at once it s also a good idea to go ahead and do that rather than continuing to pay interest maintain offline copies of your financial records in a financial crisis records that you normally have instant access to online might not be available download or print statements and records at least once every 3 months so you have the records in your possession 12 x research source keep your statements in a safe or locked document box so they re protected in the event of an emergency you might also want to save a digital copy on a usb zip drive keep the zip drive in a different location than you keep your paper copies build your portfolio to maximize long term growth make investments based on their ability to grow in decades not in months choose investments based on the financial health and management of the company not the current state of the market 13 x research source diversify your investments across several sectors so that if one sector is hard hit by a financial crisis the others will balance it out for example stock prices for entertainment companies dropped precipitously as a result of covid 19 closures but stocks in companies that sell consumer staples remained strong index funds are automatically diversified and intended to grow long term if you re a beginning investor these are typically your best choice to start a portfolio set stop loss levels for the stocks you hold your stop loss tells your broker how much loss you re willing to sustain before you sell the stock the level you set is based on your investment goals and your personal preferences however it s best to create those orders during good times when the economy is strong then forget about them 14 x research source when you re notified that a stop loss order is about to be executed resist the temptation to cancel it stick to your orders once you ve set them and you ll have cash to re invest in more recession proof stocks and funds put aside some cash to buy stock when prices fall have 3 5 of your total portfolio value set aside so you can take advantage of some bargains if the stock market plummets blue chip stocks staples and commodities often perform well even when a financial crisis temporarily sends their prices crashing 15 x research source consumer staples include things people buy regardless of the state of the economy such as foods beverages and household supplies buy stock in these crash proof companies and consider getting rid of stock in electronics retailers and other companies that rely on consumers with ample discretionary income invest in gold or silver to balance your portfolio gold and silver are strong investments that can balance your portfolio and protect you against substantial losses during a financial crisis unlike other investments the value of gold and silver tends to increase in times of crisis or uncertainty 16 x research source you can buy physical gold if you have a strong safe or other secure place to store it however it s much easier to buy shares in gold or silver etfs exchange traded funds which you have access to through your regular broker,Finance-and-Business

how to prepare a statement of cash flow using an indirect method,the statement of cash flow is part of a business s financial report typically completed once a year the information on the statement of cash flow can be compiled using one of 2 accounting methods direct or indirect with the indirect method you start with the business s net income from the income statement then adjust that amount depending on the business s operating financing and investing activities the indirect method is simpler than the direct method for businesses that keep records on an accrual basis accounting for revenue when earned and expenses when incurred 1 x research source,start with the net income listed on the income statement the income statement you prepared as part of your company s financial report includes a net income line list the amount first in the operating section on your statement of cash flow 2 x research source net income is also referred to as earnings before interest and taxes abbreviated ebit add expenses that don t affect cash flow back into income expenses such as depreciation amortization and depletion reduce your company s profit even though they don t affect cash flow since you re preparing a statement of cash flow these expenses are added back into the net income 3 x research source if one of the expenses is a negative amount put the amount in parentheses on your statement when you add the expenses back into the net income either subtract the amounts in parentheses or add negative numbers to arrive at the correct income total list the total as net operating cash flow find your company s net operating cash flow by adding together the net income and the non cash expenses this amount listed on the last line of the operating section of your statement of cash flow is the total amount of cash provided by or used in your company s operating activities 4 x research source for example if your company s net income is 150 000 and your total non cash expenses are 50 000 you would have a net operating cash flow of 200 000 total any money spent purchasing capital assets or investment instruments if your company purchased any fixed assets including real estate equipment or technology the total amount is listed on this line since this amount is money taken from cash flow it s a negative number enclosed in parentheses this category typically includes 5 x research source purchases of equipment property or technology typically abbreviated pp e which stands for property plant and equipment purchases of stocks and bonds lending of money list proceeds from sales of any capital assets or investments this line represents positive cash flow money that came into your company as a result of investing activities the following types of activities are typically included here 6 x research source sales of fixed assets including equipment or real estate sales of stocks and bonds collection of loans proceeds from insurance settlements related to damage of fixed assets compute the net cash used in investing activities add the positive and negative investing cash flow items together to find the net investing cash flow this number might be expressed as either a positive or negative amount 7 x research source for example if your company purchased equipment totaling 25 000 sold stocks for 50 000 and collected a 10 000 loan it would have 35 000 in net investing cash flow 25 000 50 000 10 000 35 000 on the other hand if your company purchased equipment totaling 25 000 but didn t have any positive cash flow related to investing activities your company would have a net investing cash flow of 25 000 or 25 000 list transactions in which funds were provided to the company for larger companies these transactions expressed as positive cash flow can be a substantial source of money coming into the company items listed as positive cash flow from financing activities include 8 x research source sales of company stock issuance of debt instruments such as bonds donor contributions for long term use for a nonprofit organization provide the amount of money that was returned to owners or lenders these transactions involve money that the company paid to owners or lenders with the amount expressed on the statement in parentheses small businesses that don t issue dividends and have little debt may not have any negative financing cash flow the following items might be included in this total 9 x research source repurchase of company stock repayment of debt payment of dividends to stockholders add all entries together to get your net financing cash flow combine the lines in this section just as you did in the operating and investing sections the resulting net financing cash flow could be positive or negative generally you want to avoid having a negative net financing cash flow particularly if it isn t significantly offset by positive operating and investing cash flows 10 x research source if this amount is negative you may need to look into your company s financing in more detail particularly if your company is trying to manage a significant amount of debt if you have a relatively small business that doesn t issue dividends or have any debt you may not need a financing section in your statement of cash flows at all combine net cash flows from operating financing and investing activities take the last 3 lines of each section in your statement of cash flow and add them together if you have negative cash flow in any category subtract that amount you can also add a negative number and get the same result 11 x research source for example if your business has 135 000 in net operating cash flow 20 000 in net financing cash flow and 12 000 in net investing cash flow you have a positive net cash flow of 103 000 for the period 135 000 20 000 12 000 103 000 copy the beginning cash balance from the previous year s balance sheet go to the financial statement prepared for the previous accounting period the cash balance represents your starting cash for the period covered by this statement 12 x research source if you don t have a report for a previous accounting period either use the amount of cash on hand that you started with or simply skip this step your ending cash balance will be the total net cash flows you calculated on your statement of cash flow for the period add the total net cash flow to the beginning cash balance the total net cash flow you found on your cash flow statement plus the cash balance you started with is your business s ending cash balance list this amount on the last line of your statement of cash flow 13 x research source for example if your company had a beginning cash balance of 250 000 and a total net cash flow of 103 000 your ending cash balance would be 353 000 250 000 103 000 353

how to prepare for capital expenditures capex,capital expenditures or capex is the money you invest back into your company so that it can grow and continue operating typically these expenses take the form of purchases of real estate buildings equipment or technology that your company will use for several years to plan for capital expenditures create a budget separate from the day to day expenses of running your business that takes into account company growth and the overall health of the economy 1 x research source,separate capital expenditures from operating expenditures operating expenditures are the day to day expenses required to keep your business running such as office supplies and utilities capital expenditures on the other hand are expenses for equipment tools property and other assets that your company will use for several years 2 x research source keeping your capex budget separate from your operating budget makes it easier to do your taxes because deductions for capital expenses are made over a number of years as depreciation while operating expenses are deducted in full in the year you incur them 3 x research source capex budgets often span longer than a year which is another good reason to keep them separate from your operating expenses 4 x research source for example you might anticipate building a new factory or warehouse which could take several years to construct and put into operation total your company s need for capital expenditures assess your current equipment buildings technology and other capital assets determine when each will need upgrades or maintenance and how much those things will cost this will give you a rough idea of how much your company needs to budget for capital expenditures 5 x research source many of these needs are fairly predictable for example if your company relies on desktop computers you might estimate that those computers need to be replaced every 3 years adding up the replacement cost for each computer gives you an idea of how much your company will need to spend on computers every 3 years your needs might also be based on your company s growth for example you might need to upgrade equipment when your production doubles if you have a larger company work with your department heads to determine your capex needs because they work with the equipment and technology on a regular basis they ll have a better idea of what upgrades and maintenance are needed create a maximum spending limit based on your needs the specific costs for necessary upgrades maintenance and eventual replacement of your capital assets give you a base amount for your capital expenditures however you ll need to budget more than that to account for any changes that might occur or unforeseen circumstances that might arise 6 x research source taking company income into account set the top end of your spending range at 1 5 to 2 times the expenses you ve already found when setting your maximum spending limit consider the position of your company and your projections for the future if you re optimistic about growth and your sales are trending upward you might set a higher spending limit than you would if your company was in the midst of a slump in performance time expenditures based on company income and growth some expenses may not be necessary at all for several years careful planning allows your company to save for those expenses in advance so the money s there when you need it 7 x research source for example suppose you know you ll need to spend 10 000 on new computers in 5 years if you budget 2 000 a year towards those computers you ll have the money when you need to purchase them other expenses might be triggered by a specific event for example if you know you ll need to upgrade your production equipment when your sales double look at the amount of money you ll need to complete the necessary upgrades and determine when your company will have that money available this helps you plan your growth strategy and sales goals so that your company doesn t grow beyond its means adjust your capex budget based on the economy national and global economic trends may affect your capex budget since it s difficult if not impossible to predict the state of the economy 5 to 10 years down the road adjustments are necessary in the event of a downturn 8 x trustworthy source financial industry regulatory agency non governmental organization responsible for regulating brokerage firms and exchange markets go to source for example if the economy is currently booming and your sector is doing well you might optimistically plan to invest more of the company s income on capital expenses however if a recession is looming 2 years later you d want to go back and adjust your capex budget accordingly so you could keep your business ahead of the curve find the value for depreciation on the income statement your business s most current income statement has a line with a value for depreciation and amortization of capital assets use this value to infer net capital expenditures indirectly 9 x research source make sure you have full financial reports for the same period since you ll need entries from other reports to calculate net capital expenditures check the balance sheet for pp e look in the assets section of your company s balance sheet for a line that provides the value of your company s property plant and equipment often abbreviated pp e you ll see the value for the current accounting period in the second column the first column gives you the value for the previous period 10 x research source the value of assets decreases over time through depreciation so don t be surprised if the amount for the current period is lower than the value for the previous period subtract the prior period s pp e from the current pp e subtracting the prior period s pp e from the current period s pp e gives you the net increase in pp e for the period if your current pp e is lower than the prior period s pp e you ll end up with a negative number which means the value of your pp e assets is decreasing 11 x research source for example suppose your company s pp e is 25 000 for the current period and 27 000 for the previous period you would have a net increase in pp e of 2 000 which you could also express as a net decrease in pp e of 2 000 add depreciation to infer the net capital expenditures for the period use the depreciation figure you found on your company s income statement adding this expense to the net increase in pp e tells you your net capital expenditures for the period if your net increase in pp e was negative add the depreciation to the negative number 12 x trustworthy source financial industry regulatory agency non governmental organization responsible for regulating brokerage firms and exchange markets go to source for example if your company has a net increase in pp e of 2 000 and depreciation expenses of 4 000 you would have net capital expenditures of 2 000 2 000 4 000 2 000 once you ve calculated your net capital expenditures compare them to your budget if your net capital expenditures exceed the maximum spending limit you budgeted go back and rework your budget accordingly if your company s net capital expenditures are greater than the depreciation this means your company s assets are growing over time conversely net capital expenditures that are less than the depreciation indicate shrinking assets,Finance-and-Business
how to set company values,company values help set your company apart from its competitors and build a sense of solidarity among employees but with so many good qualities to choose from it can be difficult to decide exactly what your company s core values should be take your time and choose the values that most represent who you are as a business owner and the image you want for your company thoroughly integrate those core values into your company s operations and they will become a seamless part of your branding 1 x research source,choose a team to work on company values if you have a relatively small company your team may only consist of you and a couple of managers or other key employees in a larger company however take care to ensure that the people on the team are people who have a track record with the company and feel passionate about the same things you do 2 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source choose people who you know are loyal to your company and will likely be with you for the long haul they should also be ideal employees who go above and beyond in their roles every day it isn t usually the best idea to just allow all of your employees to work on setting your company s values this could mean including employees who aren t truly dedicated to your company and won t be with you for long including all employees can also send the message that everyone s opinion is equally important when that might not necessarily be the case typically the opinions of the company s owners would be more important when it comes to something as important as the company s values brainstorm values that are important to you individually particularly if you started the company yourself it s likely that the company reflects your own personal values personal values are also some of the easiest to convert into company values because you already use these principals to make your decisions 3 x expert source lauren krasny executive strategic personal coach expert interview 27 march 2020 for example if you value creativity you ve likely already used a more creative approach to tackling challenges that arose in business it s also likely that you ve asked potential employees if they consider themselves creative or sought out creative ideas to help your business expand and grow look at examples from other companies for ideas values that are important to competitors and other companies in your sector might also be strong values for your company other companies value statements can also give you ideas about what not to include in your own statement 4 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source choose values that distinguish you from other companies particularly from your competitors for example suppose one of the values you have listed is integrity this is a fairly common value particularly in the financial sector however it won t distinguish you from the field unless your company happens to hold a standard of integrity higher than the rest distinguish between core values and aspirational values your company s core values are a part of every company action and inform every decision often they reflect the values of the company s founders aspirational values on the other hand are things you want but that your company currently lacks 5 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source for example suppose you have bravery listed as a value if your company operates traditionally and makes conservative decisions there s nothing brave about that you may want your company to grow into a business that has the courage to make riskier decisions but if it s not there yet bravery can t really be one of your core values while there s nothing wrong with aspirational values you can t use them to define your company as it currently exists choose core values that your company currently embodies narrow down your list to 3 5 core values you want your company s values to be easy for your employees and customers to remember if you list too many values it might be difficult to keep up with all of them and they ll also be difficult to integrate into your business discuss the list you have with your team to decide which are the most important for your company as a whole 6 x research source think about the ways the values interact with each other if you have values listed that would frequently conflict with each other eliminate at least one if not both of them for example you wouldn t want two of your values to be traditionalism and uniqueness because those would frequently be at odds one way to narrow down a long list of values is to group them into related values then choose one that the others or most of the others in that group could fall under for example in a group with values such as compassion love caring charity and empathy you might decide that the word empathy encompasses all of the other words 7 x expert source lauren krasny executive strategic personal coach expert interview 27 march 2020 create a summary heading for each of your values a single word or catchy phrase makes your values more memorable using a single word to define each of your core values also enables you to plug your values into a lot of different aspects of your business easily 8 x research source while it s not always possible you might be able to arrange your core values so that the first letter of each word creates a single word that exemplifies your values as a whole for example you might use heart which stands for honesty empathy acceptance reliability and teamwork if the first letters of your core values don t create an existing word make one up you can use it as a code and build it up into an important part of your company s culture 9 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source for example suppose you have an outdoors company and your values are challenge humor adventure risk taking and passion you can put those together to spell charp which may not be a real word but it s one you can use to unite your team around those values add detail to describe exactly what the value means to your company after your heading add a couple of sentences that put that value into context and describes exactly how your company exemplifies that value use we and us to emphasize that the company as a unit embodies these values 10 x research source for example if one of your values is adventure you might describe that by writing we believe that every challenge is an opportunity and every opportunity is an adventure we thrill to find small adventures in everyday life get employee input on how core values are expressed you have your core values and you have a good idea of what you mean by them and what they mean to your company come up with at least a couple ways to express those ideas that you can float to your employees to find out which resonates best 11 x research source for example if one of your values is adventure your employees might prefer a description that emphasizes that not all adventures are necessarily fun while they re happening because they might be concerned that requiring an element of fun puts too much pressure on them your company values will help define your company culture and hopefully motivate your employees if you describe them in a way that your employees don t understand or believe in they won t work teach your core values in employee orientation and training sessions hold training sessions specifically related to your company s core values that don t involve anything else if you have a larger company ensure that executives are on hand for these training sessions to show your employees how important your core values are 12 x research source when you re onboarding new employees have orientation on the core values before you provide training on anything else this cements the fact that these values are integral to company operations and also gives you the opportunity to reinforce those values throughout the training and onboarding process abide by your company s core values if you own your own business make your company s core values your core values as well your employees are watching what you do and the decisions you make if something doesn t line up with your company s core values they may come to view you as insincere 13 x research source if you show to your employees that the company s core values don t mean anything to you those values won t mean anything to your employees either they won t see any point in striving to live up to them if you don t bother to do the same print posters and signs so your team can see them every day if you simply mention your company s core values once during training and then never bring them up again they won t affect the behavior of your employees or the direction of your business creating signs and putting them up everywhere ensures that those values become a part of the regular working vocabulary 14 x research source if your employees are frequently in front of computers create a logo or graphic for your company s core values to use as a desktop design or screensaver use your core values to guide all business decisions frame your decisions in terms of how they might impact your values

how to find funding for research,having an idea for a research project can be exciting and inspiring the problem though is how to pay for the project different projects have different needs and grants can be tough to find and even tougher to actually get fortunately there are many resources at your disposal to help you find the grant opportunities you need especially if you re affiliated with a university after that your only challenge is writing a compelling grant application that sells your project to the granting body so they ll award the funding you need to get your project off the ground 1 x trustworthy source science magazine respected multidisciplinary scientific journal go to source,check the requirements for grants from government agencies government agencies often offer the largest number of grants for research and many of these agencies are interested in a broad range of research interests government agencies are often particularly interested in projects that don t have any immediate commercial use 2 x research source for example in the us you might apply for a grant from the national institutes of health nih or the national science foundation nsf nsf grants are most frequently awarded for projects that study fundamental scientific questions rather than how to prevent treat or diagnose a particular disease or condition check the website for the government agency offering the grant for specific guidelines and more information about the funding available government agencies also typically publish statistics reflecting the number of applications the average grant awarded and the number of grants awarded government grants are often very competitive if you re applying for a government grant get help from experienced researchers who have been awarded the same grant in the past create a budget for the project not only do you need a rough idea of how much money you need overall but you also need to know how much different categories of expenses will cost some narrower grants are designed to cover specific types of expenses so you can look to these if you have a need for them 3 x research source for example you might need money to advertise for study participants buy supplies and testing materials for the participants and rent office space to use when conducting your study if you re planning on using university facilities for all or part of your study find out your university s average rate so you can factor those costs into your budget some grants also exclude specific types of expenses if you expect significant expenses in an excluded category you probably wouldn t want to apply for that grant for example if you re looking at a grant that excludes travel expenses and the bulk of your project s expenses are travel related that grant likely wouldn t help you much talk to people in your university s research office if you re connected to a university the research office has resources to help you find funding for your project they can also advise you on how to describe your project and research team to take full advantage of opportunities that present themselves 4 x research source explain who you are the study you want to do and that you re looking for funding if you ve never applied for a grant or sought funding for research let them know full service research offices typically have professionals who can give you advice on your odds at getting particular grants help you with your grant application or even hook you up with other researchers who ve been awarded that grant in the past even if your university doesn t have research professionals ready to assist you personally there might be workshops or online sessions that you can take advantage of if you want to learn more about applying for grants and using the resources the university has available join academic associations and trade organizations in your field many of the organizations and government agencies that offer research grants advertise with academic associations and trade organizations you can also be assured that if you find a grant opportunity this way the organization or agency offering the grant is looking for a project like yours 5 x research source if you re connected to a university talk to professors in your department about the associations or organizations they re members of playing an active role in academic associations and trade organizations also looks good on your grant applications making you seem like a more worthy grant recipient usually this requires maintaining an active membership for several years use a funding opportunity database to find grants these databases typically require a paid subscription if you re affiliated with a university the institution may have an account that

must be submitted in a particular way outlined in the application instructions if you re submitting your application through your university s research office make sure you get it to them several weeks before the final deadline for the grant 17 x research source if your university research office has additional feedback on your application implement that feedback as soon as possible to submit the most polished final product possible once you ve submitted your application the waiting game begins expect it to take several months for the granting body to make a final decision some grants have

how to buy abandoned storage units,when someone fails to pay the rent on a storage unit for three months straight the storage facility seizes the unit and its contents since sorting and selling the items in an abandoned unit is time intensive storage facilities simply auction the units off to random buyers you can find live auctions in your area and attend them in person or bid online through one of the popular auction sites keep in mind this is essentially a form of gambling while you may be able to make a lot of money on some of the units you buy many of them will cost you money if the items inside turn out to be worthless,contact storage facilities in your area to find out when they host auctions search online to find storage facilities in your area call each facility one by one and ask when they host their abandoned unit auctions after they give you the date and time ask how many units are being auctioned off most storage facilities host auctions on abandoned units every 1 6 months so jot the dates and times for each auction down and pick some auctions to attend 1 x research source generally speaking you will have more luck finding a deal if there are a lot of units being auctioned off if you have to choose between 2 auctions pick the auction with the highest number of available units facilities typically wait until they have 10 20 abandoned units to host auctions larger facilities may host auctions every 2 3 months while smaller facilities usually wait 4 5 months to host auctions the exception is when the storage facility runs out of available units and needs to free up some space these auctions are usually free although larger auctions may require a small entry fee set aside 3 4 hours for an auction and bring some cash most auctions take some time so block off 3 4 hours on your calendar for the event take out as much cash as you re comfortable spending at the auction the price of abandoned units can range from 25 5 000 so only take the cash that you re willing to spend 2 x research source most storage facilities only take cash payment for their units but it s still a good idea to only bid cash even if they accept credit cards or checks it s easy to get carried away when people start bidding and you get caught up in the moment but sticking with a budget will ensure that you don t overspend the prices for storage units fluctuate wildly based on what people are willing to gamble on on rare occasions the prices can exceed 5 000 this happens when a unit appears to contain rare collectibles or expensive electronics take a flashlight and phone with you to make appraisal easier you are typically not allowed to enter an abandoned storage unit or touch its contents this means that you ll need to rely on visual inspections from the edge of each unit s doorway since storage units are dark take a flashlight to see the items at the back more clearly bring a phone with you in case you need to look up the price of items in the unit before bidding starts 3 x research source for example if there is a box labelled beanie babies 1994 you can perform a quick online search with your phone to get an estimate for what the box is worth keep in mind the box may not contain what s on the label but you can get a hint about what may be in there and decide if it s worth the gamble bring some padlocks with you as well if you end up buying a storage unit you ll need locks to secure your unit until you can pick the items up show up on time and listen to the auctioneer s instructions go to the facility s main desk and ask where the auction is being held once everyone has shown up listen to the auctioneer s instructions regarding the format of the auction and the general rules these are different from facility to facility so listen carefully to avoid making illegal bids 4 x research source pay close attention to the fees and cleaning deposit instructions facilities typically charge fees on top of the final closing price most facilities also require a cleaning deposit of 50 100 to ensure that you clean the unit out after you remove the items this deposit is returned after you clean the units you buy go online to one of the popular storage auction sites and sign up there are 2 major auction sites for abandoned storage units storage auctions and storage treasures go to either of these sites and sign up for a buyer s account by entering your name address and credit card information 5 x research source these sites are free to join you only enter a credit card number to pay the auction site s fees when you buy a unit these fees are typically 10 15 a unit you can visit storage auctions at https storageauctions com and storage treasures at https www storagetreasures com search for units in your area using the site s search function go to each site and enter your location into the search bar at the top this will pull up a map of units being auctioned off in your area even though you re buying the unit online you still need to show up to the facility to pay for the unit and collect its contents so start by looking at the auctions closest to where you live 6 x research source any auction that is currently taking place will have a large timer on it ticking down to the end of the auction sort your search if you re looking for something specific while nobody knows what the entire contents of a storage unit the facility usually lists the type of goods that appear to be in the unit if you re looking to acquire or sell a particular item use the filter function on your search to weed out search results you aren t interested in 7 x research source you ll only be able to search and filter out items that are obvious from standing in the doorway of the unit for example furniture power tools and bags of clothes tend to be fairly obvious items just from a precursory glance inspect each unit to assess its contents a big unit with lots of items is not necessarily valuable and a small unit with a few boxes isn t necessarily worthless online inspect the photos carefully to assess them in person use your flashlight to check each section of the unit once the auctioneer opens the door look for labels on boxes and assess the shape of bags and boxes to determine what may be inside 8 x research source cheap items like toys old tvs broken furniture and clothes are generally not worth buying online you may not have much to go on since there are usually only 2 5 photos for each auction inspect the images carefully to look for hints about what may be hiding in the background pay attention to the smell of a room if you re attending an auction in person take a strong whiff of the unit from the doorway if the room smells like smoke rotted food or urine the items may need to be scrapped you won t be able to sell anything that has a permanent odor even if the goods in the unit would normally be expensive 9 x research source the opposite of this is equally true a room with no odor has likely been well taken care of and is more likely to have sellable goods inside you won t be able to do this if you re bidding online this is one of the reasons that online bids tend to be less competitive than live auctions in terms of bidding estimate the value of the room and keep it in mind once you inspect the contents of a room make an educated guess about what the contents may be worth in resale if there looks like there s at least 100 worth of goods in the room and you think you can make at least 75 selling them set your estimate at 50 keep this number in the back of your mind as you bid to set a limit for yourself 10 x research source for example if you think a room can get you roughly 75 in resale and you get outbid past your personal limit of 50 don t place another bid give up on the unit and try again with the next one this can be tricky to do if you re buying online and the photos aren t particularly good look for well kept units that appear to be carefully organized if there are ripped bags thrown all over the place and items appear to be tipped over the previous owner of the unit has likely already taken everything valuable and left the rest to be auctioned however the unit is more likely to have expensive items in them if boxes are beautifully organized bags are carefully stacked and everything looks like it was handled with care 11 x research source bid on a unit until you buy it or drop out of the bidding for in person auctions once everyone has inspected the unit bidding opens up respond to the auctioneer by announcing the price you re willing to buy the unit for once you re outbid the auctioneer will ask for the next bid level continue bidding until you purchase the unit or decide that it is no longer worth the asking price 12 x research source if you re bidding online simply press the place bid button the auction page to place your bid only bid on units that you re willing to purchase do not bid for the sake of bidding you may end up buying something you don t really want if this is your first time doing this bid conservatively and study how other people bid to get a sense for the process it s perfectly fine to skip bidding on a unit if it looks worthless pay for the units you buy and collect your goods for each bid that you win you ll pay the auctioneer as soon as the auction ends if you won the auction online drive to the storage facility and pay the clerk behind the desk you ll receive the keys to the unit or be asked to lock it yourself collect the items in the storage units you bought and return the unit to the facility you are typically given a 1 2 day grace period to collect your things 13 x research source this is a real pain if you don t have a truck if you have a large number of items rent a moving truck to take your new items be sure to sweep and clean the unit before returning it to the facility so that you can get your cleaning deposit back when it comes to larger storage units it is common practice for the winning bidder to rent the storage unit they bought for 1 month to give themselves time to find storage space or unload some of the goods sort through the goods after you purchase the unit start by going through every box purse and container to see if there are items inside then if you want to keep anything set it aside sort your items based on where you re going to sell them and throw out any damaged or worthless items this will give you a better sense for how you re going to go about making your money 14 x research source for example you may have one pile for a garage sale one pile for the scrap yard and one pile of goods that you re going to sell individually online have a place to store your goods while you work to sell them many people that buy abandoned units for a living rent a warehouse or large storage unit to store their goods for your first couple of buys feel free to store the goods in your home basement or garage while you work out where to sell the items 15 x research source you can always keep some of things you buy from the unit if you d like host a garage sale to get rid of a lot of everyday items one of the easiest ways to get rid of your things is to host a garage sale wash the clothes wipe down furniture and clean other objects set signs out all over your neighborhood listing the date and location of the sale post this information on social media as well on the day of the sale set your goods out in front of your home or open the garage door and sell to the people that show up 16 x research source this is the best option for getting rid of items that people use regularly but don t have a high resale price this includes clothing kitchenware exercise equipment and holiday decorations list larger items in decent condition for sale online selling online is the best way to make money on items that may fetch a higher price like power tools cameras furniture and sporting equipment take high quality photos of your goods and list them on ebay craigslist and facebook marketplace wait for interested parties to contact you and meet with them to sell them your goods 17 x research source take specialty items and collectibles to shops that buy them if you have unique items collectibles or jewelry take them to a shop that specializes in these goods and sell them for example if you have a box of vinyl records take them to a music shop video games can be taken to a game store and comic books can be sold to comic shops 18 x research source take jewelry to get appraised before selling it you never know if you have something truly special on your hands sell broken or worthless items to scrap yards or throw them out anything that can be turned into scrap metal like broken washing machines or bed frames can be sold for scrap at a scrap yard for a small profit find a scrap yard near you and haul your things over to sell them for a few bucks any other broken or worthless items are simply going to take up space donate what you can to local charities and throw the rest of it out 19 x research source a lot of the items that you get from storage units aren t going to be worth anything these items are only going to take up space in your storage area so don t waste your time trying to sell them,Finance-and-Business
how to run a silent auction,silent auctions are auctions held without an auctioneer people place their bids on sheets of paper instead they re often used by charities to raise money but they can be tricky to put together with good planning however it s easy to set up an auction and get the most out of your items soon enough you ll have raised a good amount of money in just a few hours,recruit volunteers a contact list especially an email list is handy for this you will need volunteers to help set up volunteers to monitor and close tables at the appointed time and make sure minimum bid and minimum increase requirements were met a bank crew to organize bid sheets especially of multiple winners and collect money from winning bids and a clean up crew select volunteers willing to be officials these people will need to know the rules of the silent auction and who to go to for questions they can t answer during the event they will wear something hat vests jackets or sashes that designates them as officials ask for donations to make money for your charity you ll need items or services to sell at the silent auction many businesses and even individuals within your community will likely be happy to help if you tell them what the purpose of the auction is and who will benefit from it don t forget to ask for services as well as tangible goods perhaps a local salon will donate a haircut and or style or a local golf course could offer a round of golf with a trainer make a master list of the value of all the items if you are going to do this again next year it is nice to have the same people go to the same businesses each year include space on your master list to write who donated the item the value of it the donor s contact information who won the item their phone number and how much they paid this way you can make sure they get their items and you know how much money you made when making a master list consider using a computerized program such as excel another volunteer might be willing to input the information if so make columns for donor name address and phone number item number item description and value put a number on each item use small blank stickers or labels available at general stores and office supply businesses if you have more than a few items and if any of them are similar it makes keeping track much easier put the same number next to the item on your master list 1 x research source put the item number on the bid sheet as well so bidders can match the bid sheet to the item make a list of supplies you think you ll need and go shopping you ll need clipboards paper and pens at minimum also purchase some whiteout tape extra bid sheets and an extra roll of tape to tape your bid sheets down if you aren t using clipboards try to buy supplies at a warehouse store with a generous return policy if the store requires a membership keep that in mind when sending someone on a run for last minute supplies and make sure that person has a cell phone and that a key person at the event has that number after they have left for a supplies run you ll surely find something else that needs to be picked up if you don t already have one you ll also need a secure cash box if you plan to take credit cards which is a very good idea get a card reader services such as square offer readers that attach to tablets and smartphones print bidding sheets write the name of the item a short description of the item how much it is worth and who donated it include a minimum bid generally 40 of the retail value and minimum bid increase increments one rule of thumb for minimum increase 1 for items up to 50 2 for 50 100 5 for items over 100 make sure there is space for the bidder s name phone number and the amount they bid if you like add a buy it now price to each bid sheet in case someone wants to leave before the end of the auction 2 x research source have a volunteer make up certificates for services if the donated service didn t come with a gift certificate you can print up your own you can also use your own certificates for gift certificates with small print that are hard to read start setting up early try to set up a day before the event you ll need extra time not only to set up but to allow for any mistakes if you can set up a day or two before the auction so you don t have to stress about it consider designating someone who is willing to go to the store to buy forgotten items 3 x research source lay out all the items and the bid sheets so people can see them if you have a lot of items you may have to be pretty creative for example some things might be better hung on walls or placed on display easels don t worry if the bid sheet isn t right next to the item just make it close that s what the numbers are for 4 x research source secure the bid sheets it s easy for bid sheets to get blown or knocked around the best way to secure them is to clip each bid sheet to a clipboard with an attached pen this is an easy and convenient setup 5 x research source you can also use painter s tape to secure the bid sheets have volunteers monitor the tables monitors will help make sure bid sheets are staying in place and people are following the minimum bid and minimum increase rules people will probably have questions about some items so try to prepare the volunteers to answer them give people plenty of warning as closing time approaches make announcements at least 10 and 5 minutes before if you have one closing announce it loudly and clearly if you have interval closing times announce loudly and clearly which closing it is people will want to bid right up to the very end end at that time choose one person s watch to use and put them in charge of the time since everyone s watch is different collect the bid sheets and pens once bidding is over have the volunteers quickly pick up all the pens and sheets so no one can be sneaky and try to slip in a late bid volunteers need to circle the winning bid and draw a line through the empty spaces of the bid sheets so no one can add their name after the closing time if you have many items consider closing the tables at intervals such as every 15 minutes doing so helps keep the volunteers from being overwhelmed at table closing time 6 x research source check to make sure the winning bids have followed the minimum bid and minimum increase rules if a minimum bid was not met set that sheet aside organizers can decide later how to deal with it if a minimum increase was not met select the most recent high bidder above the minimum bid who did meet the minimum bid the volunteers then take the bid sheets to the bank 7 x research source have bank volunteers sort the sheets it s easy to sort by last name in alphabetical order if anyone has won more than one item a common occurrence staple those sheets together that way you only need to have them pay once if you have just a few items you can call people s names and have them come get their stuff cordon off the bank area and ask everyone to wait if your bidders are able to take their items home with them after the auction ask them to wait while the bids are verified it s helpful to have a game or other entertainment available to keep bidders from getting bored 8 x research source call people to the bank when the bankers are ready either call bidders up one at a time by name or just have them form a line if you are using the latter method the bankers will have to search through the bid sheets for the bidder s name so it s important that the bid sheets are alphabetized set aside bid sheets for people who don t come to the bank if someone has won one or more items and doesn t appear on their own set those bid sheets aside when you re just about done with the people in line have the emcee announce their names in case they are still at the event if the bidder still doesn t appear note it on the bid sheet you can arrange an alternate pickup or give the item to the next highest bidder depending on the rules you established have a volunteer collect the items as people pay you could send people to collect their own items but silent auctions often attract people who want a good deal and might not particularly support the cause for which you are raising money most people are very honest but one bad apple can really spoil the event for others deal with the leftover items after the line of people is gone you will probably have things left over these people went home didn t know they won or whatever that s why you have their phone number on the bid sheet if you can t leave the items at the event location you will probably have to take them home make sure you or a volunteer has the bid sheets with the phone numbers for items that met the minimum bid but weren t picked up you or a volunteer will need to call the bidder sort out all the bid sheets that go to the same person they may have bought one thing or twenty add up their total and call to tell them they have won ask if they could please come get their things you may have to be flexible about arranging a time to meet them if you have lots left over divide up the pile so no one has to call 20 people this part can be a big hassle so divvy the work to make it easier prepare for derelict bidders undoubtedly there will be people who don t want to pay for the things they bid on call the next person on the bid sheet and see if they still want it count the money and checks before going to the bank bank tellers can make mistakes look for checks that are made out improperly the bank may still accept them but you should be aware of them give thanks and recognition to those who donated and bought if you have volunteers on your email contact list send out an email thank you and let them know how successful the event was send a personalized thank you to vendors and businesses who donated goods and services contact any newspaper columnists or radio disc jockeys who promoted your event to thank them and let them know it was a success write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper thanking people who helped if the winning bid was more than the value of the item the person may want need a tax deductible receipt for the amount donated over the value along with the thank you 9 x research source if your organization has a business office or accounting department you may want to ask them about

of the assigned preview time to examine the items you have shortlisted from the catalogs evaluate their quality to your best ability and carefully check for any visible defects speak to the auction house experts and clarify any questions you may have remember that the information they could reveal about previous owners and history is often limited at seized asset auctions since these are confiscated items nevertheless there s no harm in asking check certifications of appraisals and other inspection reports by the auction house never purchase high value jewelry without checking these documents if possible bring someone with a sound knowledge about appraising fine jewelry they can help verify its quality and the information provided by the auction house inquire about the delivery process seized asset auctions prefer to process payments and clear out the inventory as soon as possible so if you win a jewelry item you can often take it home straight after the auction once the official documentation processing is done bid when you enter the auction room select a seat where you can observe the rest of the bidders it s also important for you to clearly see the items auctioned and ensure that you are visible to the auctioneer as well wait for the lot you have shortlisted to be brought forward and start bidding many auction houses would give you a paddle with a bidding number raise this whenever you want to place a bid and ensure that the auctioneer has seen you each auction will have a bidding increment amount to outbid others so find this out ahead of time once

earlier if you re the highest bidder then you ve won pay and take the item home once you ve outbid others the auctioneer and the auction house staff will note down your bidding number and the hammer price which is the last bid you ve placed to win the item each live auction will have its own preferred payment methods which often include cash and credit cards cards will require an id for verification purposes you can pay at the end of the auction or right after you ve won the item if you want to leave early after making the payment you can simply take the item home most auction houses

how to run a business to business online auction,this article addresses the business to business online auction approach for auction values in excess of a quarter of a million dollars or pounds,the first step is to pick your category to take to auction this can be a daunting task owing to the complexity the average business faces in their purchased goods and services aim for categories that can be clearly defined and specified that are likely to attract the interest of bidders and that have a sufficient number of bidders in the market ideally you would have at least three motivated and capable bidders taking part in your auction once you have chosen a category the next step is to define it and all the items contained within it generally e auction software allows you to upload drawings specifications photos brochures and any other file that can help to clarify what exactly it is that you are looking to buy or sell depending on whether it is a forward or reverse auction that you wish to run the third step is to find and engage the bidders to take part in your auction this is known as the sourcing exercise cast your net far and wide to make sure you find the best bidders in the market speak to each bidder in person if time allows as this will give you a chance to establish a relationship and gain an understanding on how you can mutually benefit each other beyond just a question of price at this stage you may wish to obtain qualification prices this allows you to gain an understanding of any discrepancies in the information you gave them by seeing if certain submitted prices are wildly different it will also enable you to get a provisional understanding of which bidders are in the right ball park and which are either much too expensive or much too cheap in which case you may wish to have further conversations with them with perhaps a view to eliminate them from the auction the final advantage of using this qualification price stage is to assess whether any items that you have included should be removed from the auction for example if no one has bid for them or if the only bids you have received are not competitive now that you have defined what it is that you are taking to auction have established who your bidders are and made sure that they are all motivated and keen to take part and confirmed that the items you are taking to auction have received competitive quotes then you are ready for the auction itself right before the actual auction you may wish to take your bidders through a training exercise on perhaps a test auction to make sure they know how to bid and to confirm with them exactly what it is that they are bidding for the final step is to run the auction most e auction software allows you to monitor your bidders and who is presently logged on any absent bidders should be chased up by telephone to ensure they are able to take part the auction itself would most commonly be set for a 30 minute duration with the ability to auto extend should a bid be placed in the last few minutes make sure you are present throughout to answer any questions that may be posted during the auction once the auction is completed be sure to thank all your bidders for their time and commitment to your request and reassure them that you shall give them the feedback that they deserve,Finance-and-Business

how to avoid online auction description mistakes,sometimes sellers get carried away with listing so much stuff they feel justified in typing nothing more than as pictured and not bothering to provide better details other than what the online auction site forces you to generate at other times a seller may not realise how maddening this can be to buyers who are trying to find as much solid information as possible about an item in order to weight their bid amount and to make a choice between buying your item or somebody else s either online or at the store this article sets out some common errors to avoid in writing your online auction sales description,don t assume the buyer understands what you want them to understand with a picture the adage a picture is worth a thousand words comes with as many stories of why this saying isn t always accurate a picture can be doctored it can be dark and it can be dismal a buyer cannot make up the description that is lacking simply by viewing your pictures even stellar sets of photos with arrows to features cannot ever make up for a good solid description to help allay a buyer s fears and assumptions avoid relying on the pictures alone and definitely avoid using such cop out terms as as is item as pictured item purchased in condition seen don t be lazy no matter whether you are a one time seller or a full time seller you need to take the time to detail the key points about the item you are selling if you don t do this then perhaps the local pawnshop is a better bet for you a description of key elements will help the buyer assess readily whether or not this sale is worth pursuing and if your item is the one that beats the other similar items hands down there is no need to make it overly long or flowery but there is a need to make clear concise statements about the elements of the item that matter then use the photos or illustrations to back up your written points avoid using subjective language nobody really cares if you think this item is the best thing since sliced bread buyers in wagga don t know sellers in oregon from a bar of soap so why should they trust your say so that this item is the best thing anywhere in the world unless you ve travelled all over the world examining this item in great detail you really don t have a leg to stand on making such a broad sweeping statement if you have done so state such along with your business or professional qualifications don t overstate the value or rarity there is a bizarre tendency for enthusiastic amateur sellers to believe that they are holding the only stock of its kind in their collection because they don t take the time to look further afield and some even don t bother to look on the online auction site itself for duplicates avoid such lines as there s no better deals anywhere else or this is rare and it s unlikely you ll find another one anywhere that is just an invitation to go and find another one and the more a buyer turns up the lower on the list goes yours stick to factual statements such as it s in excellent condition for its age it is brand new it is less than cost price in insert your region has no foxing is still in original box etc factual statements those are things buyers do want to know when comparing apples with apples and can often check do not be ambiguous when you leave things out or you use euphemistic language you do your sale and your buyer an injustice one of two things can happen with ambiguous language the buyer may buy and then be angry or disappointed when they assumed things arising out of the unclear description and leave you poor feedback or the item won t sell because savvy buyers haven t a clue what you re getting at again be clear concise and straightforward in your description if the item has bad points be honest this will enable buyers to pay a price reflecting the problem whilst accepting it and it may even be a problem that is easily remedied or is outweighed by rarity or uniqueness never stoop to criticising anybody else whether it be other online sellers or stores or a non paying bidder just do not do it it is poor taste it reflects badly on you and it is often untrue because you just do not know the full story behind what other sellers or buyers are doing and this could land you in hot water with them let alone putting off future buyers buyers don t like a bad sport and the more negativity written into a sale the more a buyer will be hesitant even if only subconsciously friendly open and welcoming language without being condescending or deriding of others is what makes for the best read on an auction page avoid auction fatigue by listing lots if part of your despair at writing descriptions is due to trying to list single items that would be better sold as batches for example knitting patterns used stamps baby s bibs etc then don t hesitate to do so and to put your writing efforts into fully describing the lot and explaining the bargain being received by the buyer in getting a lot rather than a single item this can be a very helpful way for buyers who have accumulated too many items in a burst of enthusiastic collecting,Finance-and-Business

item the bank statement balance would need to be credited or increased to reflect the true amount of cash for example assume your bank balance was 5 000 you deposited 1 500 on july 31st your july bank statement does not include the 1 500 deposit to reconcile the balance you would add 1 500 to the bank statement balance increasing the bank balance to 6 500 the 1 500 is a reconciling item decrease the bank balance for all outstanding checks a cleared check refers to a check that has posted to the bank s records any check that has not been cleared by the bank is called an outstanding check this

account for deposits properly you increase the bank balance for 1 500 in deposits in transit your change adjusts the bank balance to 5 000 1 500 6 500 say that 5 checks totaling 3 000 are outstanding at the end of the month to account for outstanding checks you decrease the adjusted bank balance by 3 000 your new adjusted bank balance is 6 500 3 000 3 500 make sure to check the prior month s statement as well to ensure that any outstanding checks from the previous period have cleared this month if a check has yet to clear contact the payee the person who should receive the payment to learn why if the check is still outstanding after a month it may be lost check for any errors made by the bank s processing department if you re reconciling a business cash account your accounting is

remove the reconciling item if the discrepancy isn t a bank error it may represent fraudulent activity assume that a secretary manages a dental office the checkbook is on the front desk when the secretary is at lunch a visitor steals a check from the checkbook and cashes it when the check posts to the bank account it is a fraudulent transaction assume also that the dentist notices the cashed check in the bank statement the dentist calls the bank and the bank adds funds back to the account that removes the reconciling item verify that all checks have posted when your company receives the bank statement you should print a report listing all of the checks written and deposits made during the month a company will probably have accounting software that can provide reports if you re reconciling your personal bank account you should review your check register and your deposit slips a company should print the cash reports and also review the check register and deposit slips review all of the checks you have written in numbered order verify that the check posted to your bank statement if the check cleared your bank indicate that in your records you can document the cleared check using accounting software or using a manual report you should also review checks written in the prior month review to see if those checks posted to the current month s bank statement if the check cleared indicate that fact in your records if the check has not cleared contact the payee the check may be lost when you finish your review you should create a list of each check that has not posted to the bank account that list should include the check number the dollar amount and the payee the total dollar amount represents your outstanding checks for the month outstanding checks are a reconciling item confirm that all deposits have posted a business should print a list of all deposits made for the month the company should also review all deposits slips if you re reconciling your

that list should include the deposit amount and the date of the deposit the total dollar amount represents your deposits in transit for the month deposits in transit are a reconciling item subtract any service charges and automated debits you need to deduct all bank charges from your cash account one type of bank charge is a monthly service charge you may also be charged if you overdraw your account balance most of these charges are posted to your bank statement but may not be posted to your cash account at month end you also need to adjust your cash records for interest earned on your bank account balance 6 x research source if a 10 service fee is posted to the bank statement for example it would need to be deducted from the cash account until you post the amount to your cash

bank has credited to your cash account balance until you post the interest to your records the amount is a reconciling item deduct any automatic payments many accounts may have automatic monthly payments set up for certain recurring bills if you don t have the payment date for auto payments on your calendar you may not see the withdrawal until it appears on the monthly bank statement review your bank statement post any missing automated debit payments to your cash account this step will remove a reconciling item deduct any nsf checks if the bank statement indicates that a not sufficient funds check bounced during the month that means that the check amount was not deposited to your account you will have to deduct the check amount from your cash account records if the bank charges you a fee for depositing a bad check you will also need to deduct that amount you will also be charged if you overdraw your account check for any errors you ve made during the month as you compare your cash account activity to the bank you may find errors that you made for example you might post the wrong dollar amount for a check or deposit to your cash records those errors will create a reconciling item 7 x research source if your balance is off by a multiple of nine for example 270 or 630 you have likely made a transposition error this means you accidentally switched the order of two digits in a deposit for example you may have filled out a check for 310 but recorded it in your records as 130 once you finish all of your reconciliation work your cash account balance plus or minus all reconciling items should equal the balance per the bank statement if that formula does not equal review your work until you account for all of the reconciling items correctly 8 x research

how to avoid being charged overdraft fees,if your checking account shows a negative balance your financial institution can penalize you with a charge known as an overdraft fee such a fee can be expensive and frustrating 1 x research source this article discusses several ways to prevent overdraft fees from occurring,select an overdraft option your bank may offer a service that limits or completely eliminates overdraft fees typically you have three such options overdraft coverage a limited coverage in which the bank will honor a check that pulls your balance below zero anticipating that you will reimburse them in the immediate future overdraft protection the bank will automatically withdraw funds from another of your accounts or grant you a line of credit in the event of an overdraft a line of credit typically involves interest payments and transaction fees complete opt out you re under no obligation to have any overdraft protection at all if you opt out one or more of your checks could be rejected in such a case you might be charged an overdraft fee ask to have an overdraft charge eliminated if you very rarely overdraw an account you ve maintained for a long time approach a customer service representative about having the overdraft fee removed many banks will waive such a fee for normally reliable customers negotiate if you have a series of overdraft charges your bank may consider waiving a series of charges stemming from the same overdraft if you re willing to set up a savings account for automatic overdraft protection as an added incentive you could offer to accept other services with the bank in exchange for eliminating the fees avoid relying on your available balance it s tempting to accept the available balance shown on your atm receipt however that figure does not reflect checks that haven t yet been presented for payment outstanding checks or bank card purchases that haven t been processed yet you may also have some automatic payments that will occur within the next few days keep your check register up to date the best way to ascertain your available balance is to keep your check register up to date immediately record every transaction so that you have an accurate record of checks that will soon be presented for payment that will let you know how much money you have available find out if your bank or credit union has an app to help you maintain your check register 2 x research source check with your bank about online services many banks offer a portfolio of services to help their customers manage money if you prefer managing your register on paper do it consistently so that you know that your available balance is accurate balance your checkbook a pending overdraft fee may indicate that you haven t balanced your checkbook lately do this regularly in search of arithmetical errors or failure to record transactions include bank card purchases in your register if you occasionally make bank card purchases be sure to note them in your register such purchases like checks often take a few days to clear remember that deposited checks including paychecks take time to post to your account it s best to wait a day or two before drawing on those deposits the bank can tell you when those funds will be available for use try the envelope system one way to avoid overdraft fees is to use mainly cash in your transactions you can do that and stay within budget by using the envelope system 3 x research source take several envelopes and label them according to budget items gasoline eating out groceries etc at the beginning of the month take out cash from your account and put the amount that s budgeted for each expense item in the envelope with the appropriate label for example if you ve budgeted 100 for gasoline for the month put 100 in the envelope labeled gasoline when you want to buy something within your budget do so by pulling the cash out of the appropriate envelope if it s time to spend 20 for gasoline pull 20 out of that envelope and use it to pay for your fuel create an artificial buffer give yourself a cushion in the event something goes wrong or you make an error when balancing your checkbook set a lower limit for your balance and never let it fall below that for example you might prefer never to let your account fall below 100 perhaps 500 if you write a lot of checks or often write big checks 4 x research source some accounts require a minimum balance to avoid fees fees for going below a minimum balance are generally smaller than overdraft fees but they are still an unnecessary expense ask your bank or credit union if they have such fees and what their requirements are for your minimum balance if you re trying to build up savings maintain your own minimum balance above whatever the bank requires and raise that minimum every month besides creating your own insurance against overdraft fees you ll also be providing a cash cushion which can help you avoid going into debt in case of a financial emergency or unexpected expense ask about your bank s policy regarding deposits and payments some banks will process payments prior to processing deposits that means if you have a deposit and a payment on the same day your account could drop below zero if the payment is processed before the deposit understand the policy and schedule your payments accordingly look into your bank s policy regarding the crediting of deposits you might find that corporate paychecks clear sooner than handwritten checks do familiarize yourself with the bank s policies about how long it takes certain checks to clear so that you know when you can expect the money to be credited to your account,Finance-and-Business

to try to change conditions you can t agree to for instance you may be able to only cover the debt or transaction up to a certain amount or avoid covering additional fees accrued after the initial transaction open a document in a word processing program you should type the letter rather than hand writing it because this is an important legal document many word processing programs even have templates you can use for formatting letters this will make formatting your guarantor letter much easier especially if you have limited experience with word processing if a guarantor form has been supplied to you simply fill in all the required information and return it to the institution from which it came begin by dating the letter at the top left or top right of the page also include your name address email address and phone number at the top 4 x research source some word processing programs include this information automatically in your letterhead so make sure you are not repeating this information in the header and the body of the letter address the letter to the company requiring the guarantee not the specific company officials you have been dealing with be sure that the tone of your letter is official and straight forward 5 x research source for example dear pine street property management is a simple but appropriate way to start your letter begin writing your first paragraph by identifying yourself and your relationship to the person you are guaranteeing ultimately this section explains to the reader why you are willing to take on this responsibility on someone else s behalf state what you are guaranteeing in your own words whether you are guaranteeing a rental agreement a house loan a visa application or a business deal for instance you should state plainly in your own words what you are agreeing to do this will serve to lay out the terms you are comfortable with and will make it clear to the reader what you have generally agreed to do 6 x research source explain why your guarantor letter is necessary in the first place if it is at all unclear while this is probably not necessary in all circumstances but this is a chance to clarify for the reader any special circumstances that need to be addressed there is no need to be vague about why you need to guarantee the transaction as the entity you are writing to should have all pertinent financial information already just simply and quickly state why you are needed if possible immediately follow this information with why you believe the person you are signing for will make their own payments without you in fact to enter into this agreement tin the first place you should have a sense that this will be the case state it to reassure your reader and yourself in cases where you know you are actually going to make all the payments for instance if you are guaranteeing the lease for your child s apartment while they are attending college just make your responsibility clear finish your letter by making a separate clear and concise statement summarizing what your guarantor letter covers state your name the name of the person you are signing for and the exact transaction that you will guarantee this is also where you can be explicit about any financial or date limits you have placed on the transaction be as specific as possible 7 x research source for example i richard pearson hereby agree to guarantee and be liable for the payment of rent at 745 sperry street springfield mo for the terms of the lease as signed by amy pearson this guarantee will remain in effect until december 22 2012 or upon termination of the lease if you are guaranteeing someone for visa purposes you should state the applicant s name application number address and possibly their date of birth it is a good idea to check with the applicant and the issuing consulate about what is expected in the letter supply any other information as requested by the company this may include a bank account number annual income social security number home address or date of birth 8 x research source be absolutely sure that this information is needed before including it in your letter providing this type of sensitive financial information should only be done with caution and with certainty about the security of the institution you are submitting it to spell check the letter its also a good idea to ask someone to proofread it two sets of eyes are always better than one print the letter on personal or company letterhead if you are writing a bank guarantee letter this is necessary but a letterhead always looks more official for any type of transaction you may also be asked to have your supervisor sign and date the letter for example if your company is guaranteeing a transaction as opposed to you personally employ a notary public to witness your signature and sign and stamp the letter this may or may not be required by the entity asking for the guarantor letter if it is remember to wait to sign and date your letter by hand in front of the notary and to leave space for a notary signature and stamp in your formatting make personal copies of the letter for yourself before turning it in it is important that you have your own copy of what you have actually agreed to don t assume that the company you are submitting your letter to will provide you a copy later on 9 x research

how to calculate effective interest rate,when analyzing a loan or an investment it can be difficult to get a clear picture of the loan s true cost or the investment s true yield there are several different terms used to describe the interest rate or yield on a loan including annual percentage yield annual percentage rate effective rate nominal rate and more of these the effective interest rate is perhaps the most useful giving a relatively complete picture of the true cost of borrowing to calculate the effective interest rate on a loan you will need to understand the loan s stated terms and perform a simple calculation,familiarize yourself with the concept of the effective interest rate the effective interest rate attempts to describe the full cost of borrowing it takes into account the effect of compounding interest which is left out of the nominal or stated interest rate 1 x research source for example a loan with 10 percent interest compounded monthly will actually carry an interest rate higher than 10 percent because more interest is accumulated each month the effective interest rate calculation does not take into account one time fees like loan origination fees these fees are considered however in the calculation of the annual percentage rate determine the stated interest rate the stated also called nominal interest rate will be expressed as a percentage 2 x research source the stated interest rate is usually the headline interest rate it s the number that the lender typically advertises as the interest rate determine the number of compounding periods for the loan the compounding periods will generally be monthly quarterly annually or continuously this refers to how often the interest is applied 3 x research source mathforum org dr math faq faq interest html usually the compounding period is monthly you ll still want to check with your lender to verify that though familiarize yourself with the formula for converting the stated interest rate to the effective interest rate the effective interest rate is calculated through a simple formula r 1 i n n 1 4 x research source in this formula r represents the effective interest rate i represents the stated interest rate and n represents the number of compounding periods per year calculate the effective interest rate using the formula above for example consider a loan with a stated interest rate of 5 percent that is compounded monthly using the formula yields r 1 05 12 12 1 or r 5 12 percent the same loan compounded daily would yield r 1 05 365 365 1 or r 5 13 percent note that the effective interest rate will always be greater than the stated rate familiarize yourself with the formula used in case of continuously compounding interest if interest is compounded continuously you should calculate the effective interest rate using a different formula r e i 1 in this formula r is the effective interest rate i is the stated interest rate and e is the constant 2 718 5 x research source calculate the effective interest rate in case of continuously compounding interest for example consider a loan with a nominal interest rate of 9 percent compounded continuously the formula above yields r 2 718 09 1 or 9 417 percent after reading and fully understanding the theory calculation can be simplified in the following way 6 x research source after familiarising the theory do the maths differently find the number of intervals for a year it is 2 for semi annual 4 for quarterly 12 for monthly 365 for daily number of intervals per year x 100 plus the interest rate if the interest rate is 5 it is 205 for semi annual 405 for quarterly 1205 for monthly 36505 for daily compounding effective interest is the value in excess of 100 when the principal is 100 do the maths as 205 200 2 100 105 0625 405 400 4 100 105 095 1 205 1 200 12 100 105 116 36 505 36 500 365 100 105 127 the value exceeding 100 in case a is the effective interest rate when compounding is semi annual hence 5 063 is the effective interest rate for semi annual 5 094 for quarterly 5 116 for monthly and 5 127 for daily compounding just memorise in the form of a theorem no of intervals x 100 plus interest divided by number of intervals x100 raised to the power of intervals the result multiplied by 100 the value exceeding 100 will be the effective interest yield,Finance-and-Business

how to make ach payments,automated clearing house ach payments are an electronic funds transfer from one bank account to another ach payments have been around for over forty years and were developed with the intention of being faster safer and more efficient than the use of paper checks to transfer funds many businesses and government entities have long used ach payments to direct deposit paychecks for instance and they have also gained popularity among individuals as a way to pay taxes and recurring bills setting up ach payments is normally a fairly simple process that said it is helpful to understand how they work the variations and risks involved and the basics of setting up ach payments either through your intended payee or your financial institution,learn the basics of ach the national automated clearing house association nacha was established in 1974 by several u s regional clearing houses the entities that facilitate money transfers between financial institutions 1 x research source ach was essentially an agreement among these organizations to streamline the process of clearing funds for transfer the nacha now estimates that 40 trillion per year passes through the ach network find out how ach transactions work making a paperless payment to your electric company for instance involves electronic transactions between you and your bank the electric company and its bank and the two banks and one of two ach operators which clear the transaction 2 x research source the payment originator you initiates an ach payment with his her financial institution the originating depository financial institution odfi your bank records the ach entry the odfi batches together and sends multiple ach requests to one of two ach operators the chosen ach operator the federal reserve or the clearing house clears the request and transmits it in a batch to the receiving depository financial institution rdfi the electric company s bank the rdfi credits the receiver s the electric company account within 1 2 business days compare ach to alternatives with elements such as paperless transactions clearing of payments between banks and credits to accounts an ach payment has some similarities to wire transfers writing paper checks and credit card charges but it is different from each and has strengths and possible weaknesses vis a vis these alternatives a wire transfer is a direct paperless transaction between payer and payee cutting out the middle man that clears the transaction the wire transfer company such as western union only facilitates the process and charges a fee for it wire transfers are faster happening almost immediately but cost more because of facilitator fees and may run more risk of fraud because the lack of a middle man to clear the transaction if you need to get money to someone right away a wire transfer is still the fastest way to go 3 x research source paper checks follow almost exactly the same process as ach payments but they are physically bundled cleared and exchanged between financial institutions sending a paper check in the mail may seem safer to those who fear online hacking but remember that a paper check has your name address phone number account number and routing number this is more than enough information for a criminal to wreak havoc on your finances 4 x research source if you are debating whether to set up automatic payments by either ach payments or credit card charges your fraud liability level is one factor to consider by federal code your liability for fraudulent credit card charges is 0 while with ach payments or debit card transactions for that matter the maximum liability is 50 if you notify your bank within 48 hours or 500 if you do so within 60 days 5 x research source also keep in mind that if your credit card number is stolen then this can reduce your available funds on the credit card but will not affect your bank account balance however ach debit will affect your bank account and you may end up with a bounced check or not be able to pay your bills if the number is stolen distinguish ach credit payments from ach debit payments there are actually two forms of ach payment you can make you may want to think of them as a push and a pull payment method respectively 6 x research source an ach credit payment is the form most common to online bill paying through your bank you authorize your bank to send payments single or recurring to the designated payee an ach debit payment however is more common to online bill paying through the recipient s website for example setting up automatic payments via your electric company s site essentially you are authorizing the payee to take payments single or recurring from your account ach debits thus require you to provide your account number and routing number to a third party the payee so they can withdraw funds ach credits avoid this potential security risk because such information remains in house with your bank therefore if you have the option of setting up automatic payments for your electric bill either through your bank ach credit or through the electric company s website ach debit there may be less risk to your personal financial information by choosing the former having all of your bill pay information together in one account can also be quite convenient if you need to change or verify anything then it is all in the same place contact your financial institution regarding your access to online bill pay features online bill pay has become a standard feature of bank accounts and is usually free with your account because you are setting up online payments through your own bank you don t have to worry about providing your bank account information if you have multiple accounts with that bank though you ll have to choose which to use for online payments online bill payment interfaces vary by financial institution but there is no reason yours should be anything but intuitive and easy to use if it isn t you may want to shop around for a new bank see if your intended recipient is eligible for ach credit payments via your bank most banks should permit you to make an online payment to virtually any company or individual just as you can write a check to just about anyone likewise just about any potential payee should be able and willing to receive payments from your bank but it cannot hurt to contact them and make sure your online bill pay interface probably has information on common payees credit card companies local utilities etc already on file and ready to go you may have to search or choose your electric company from a list for instance then provide your account number and payment zip code from your electric bill often this is enough to get you started other less common payees or individuals may require additional information to be provided look at your account statements and or contact the company directly to obtain the proper billing information determine if you are making an ach credit or a paperless paper transaction some smaller payees such as perhaps your local water authority and almost certainly individuals may not be set up to receive paperless ach credit payments in this case your bank may actually print up and mail a paper check for you as part of its online bill pay service instead of you remembering to write out and send a check to the water company then what may be happening is that you are authorizing your bank to create and send a check to the water company for you each time payment is due this isn t actually an ach credit payment but you will probably set it up in the same manner as one examine your online billing statements which usually now contain check images you should be able to see the image of the check drawn up by the bank on your behalf to pay the water bill while you ll save on postage please note that these paper checks drawn up for you will have your account and routing numbers on them so they are no more secure in that regard than sending a check yourself many people use online bill pay instead of purchasing paper checks regardless of whether they use an ach credit or their bank account set up recurring payments if desired for your rent payment or electric bill you ll almost certainly want to set up a monthly payment thereby giving yourself one less thing to forget about each month you can set up a recurring ach credit in the same amount at the same time each month which is good for something where the amount due remains steady such as a mortgage payment if your bank is able to receive online statements for your from the payees you designate when available from a payee this is usually an option when you add a new online bill payee you can set up recurring payments in varying monthly amounts for instance you can have your total balance due or minimum balance due for your credit card bill paid automatically each month without you having to take any action if you have multiple automatic payments happening each month keep a close eye on your account balance to make sure you maintain sufficient funds if you have insufficient funds to make an ach credit payment the payment will not be made see if your intended recipient allows ach debit payments call or more likely visit the recipient s website if you are setting up ach debit payments you will more than likely be doing so via signing up on the biller s website most companies of any significant size have embraced online bill payment because it cuts down on their costs think of all the time and staff it takes to open all those envelopes stuffed with paper checks and payment stubs follow the recipient s procedures for setting up ach debits these will naturally vary by recipient but there are some typical features of the process if you are signing up online you will have to provide along with standard information about yourself your bank account and routing number you ll find these numbers along the bottom of your checks if you don t have paper checks you can find your account number on statements or other documents and contact your bank and request your routing number just a reminder when setting up online payments or sending out a check whether voided or active be careful regarding whom you are providing access to your account and routing numbers some security experts recommend that you treat these numbers in the same way you do your social security number so think before you provide them 7 x research source if you are signing up by filling out a form to be mailed faxed or scanned you may have to provide a canceled check which will give the payee your account and routing numbers write void across the middle of the check in bold large letters and in ink keep an eye out for a small test transaction if you are setting up automatic payments for your phone bill you may see an ach debit for a few pennies or even 0 00 from globofone or whatever it may be on your bank statement such a test transaction is the recipient s way of confirming that your information is correct and that it is able to pull funds out of your account set up your payment parameters and wait for your ach debits to begin establish the timing and amounts recurring amount balance due minimum due etc to be withdrawn each month or other time period you may be able to set up automatic notifications by email or text when you have a new bill when a payment is posted etc this is usually a wise choice there may be a delay of up to 1 2 billing cycles before an automatic payment plan takes effect so be prepared to pay another bill or two as you did before make sure you have sufficient funds so that an automatic ach debit does not overdraw your account if the electric company tries to pull out 100 from your account and you only have 80 in it expect to pay overdraft fees with your bank as well as any interest penalties imposed by the payee,Finance-and-Business

how to react if your bank closes your account,when you open a bank account the bank is under no obligation to continue the banking relationship and technically may close your bank account at any time and for virtually any reason in many countries they aren t even required to tell you why they ve decided to close your account if your bank closes your account you must act fast to uncover the reason and try to mitigate the damage so you can open another bank account as soon as possible 1 x research source,find out why your account was closed when you get notification from the bank that your account is being closed that notification also may give you a reason but not necessarily even if it does it s still a good idea to call your bank s customer service number and ask 2 x research source your country may have laws forbidding the closure of an account for a discriminatory reason such as because of your race or gender aside from that banks generally are free to close accounts for any reason or for no reason at all typically accounts are closed because you are significantly overdrawn have had frequent overdrafts or have bounced a number of checks keep in mind that in most cases the bank is not required by law to tell you why they closed your account and may refuse to give you a reason 3 x research source determine if you re entitled to any notice in some countries banking law requires a bank to provide you with reasonable notice if they are going to close your account what constitutes reasonable may differ significantly 4 x research source for example new zealand requires at least 14 days notice while at least 30 calendar days notice is required in the u k for personal accounts 5 x research source the amount of time that constitutes reasonable notice also may depend on whether your account is a business or personal account and whether you are the only account holder or hold the account jointly with someone else review your recent purchases if you only use your debit card for purchases you may not have any pending transactions however if you ve recently written a check and it hasn t cleared your account yet you ll need to make arrangements with the merchant 6 x research source if you have online access to your account check the list of transactions and reconcile them with your own receipts or records of purchases to figure out what s still outstanding if you can t access your account online go to a branch and ask for a print out of your recent transactions get a check for the balance if your account balance is positive when the bank closes your account it should issue you a check for the balance if your account is over drafted on the other hand you ll need to make arrangements to pay that off 7 x research source if you do have an overdraft on the account try to make arrangements with the bank to get it paid as quickly as possible owing money to a bank can devastate your credit and may impede you from being able to get another bank account keep in mind that while the account remains overdrawn you also may incur additional fees increasing the cost the longer you go without paying it suspend automatic payments if you have automatic payments set up through your bank they likely have already been stopped however if you have any automatic payments set up through the company you have to pay you ll need to contact that company to have the payments stopped 8 x research source go through your records and make sure you ve gotten everything look out especially for payments that may only come every other month or once a year take care of any direct deposits if you get your paycheck direct deposited to your bank account you ll need to make other arrangements before the bank closes your account for good you may want to let a check go through however if you have an overdraft 9 x research source take a look at the balance and if there is an overdraft talk to someone in customer service at your bank about the situation if you over drafted soon before your check hit the bank may be willing to work with you to reinstate your account if reinstatement isn t an option call your employer or the payroll department as soon as possible to make sure the situation is corrected so you ll have access to your paycheck if your employer requires direct deposit of paychecks you may have to open another bank account first but your employer needs to know about the situation as soon as possible look at your chexsystems report if you bank in the united states the account closure may have been reported to chexsystems a consumer reporting service that provides banks with information about your banking history and relationship with banks 10 x research source there are several different companies in the u s that do this but chexsystems is the most popular you may want to contact your bank to find out which system they use you can get a copy of your report by visiting consumerdebit com or calling 1 800 428 9623 if there are any inaccuracies on the report you can dispute them with chexsystems and they will work with the reporting institution to correct them file a complaint with your government banking authority if you believe the bank s closure of your account was illegal or unfair you can take the issue to your government s banking authority search online to find the correct office to file your complaint 11 x research source for example in the u k you would file a complaint with the financial ombudsman service in the u s if you feel the bank has closed your account unfairly go to consumerfinance gov and file a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau 12 x trustworthy source us consumer financial protection bureau u s government agency for protecting consumers in the financial sector go to source before you file your complaint gather as much information and documentation as you can of the account closure the more information you provide the government the better they can help you identify banks that do not use chexsystems if your bank closed your account you may have negative information on your chexsystems report however not all banks use chexsystems there also are some that review all applications on a case by case basis 13 x research source likewise if your bank used a different service you should look for banks that don t use that service these banks will be more likely to open an account for you because they won t know about what happened between you and the bank that closed your account you may be able to find this information on the bank s website if not you can always call the toll free customer service line and ask many branches also have the logo of the service they use on their doors try a small community bank smaller community banks are far more likely to review applications on a case by case basis and typically are more forgiving if you had your account closed because you over drafted or made a mistake 14 x research source if you apply for an account at a small community bank go into the branch in person rather than applying online many of these small banks don t even accept applications online dress presentably in clean neat clothing so you make a good impression with the banker be as open and honest as possible about your past relationship with your old bank and the reason you want to open an account this can prevent you from having problems again with this bank if they discover you lied on your application or failed to disclose important information consider a credit union since credit unions are owned by their members they tend to be more forgiving of past mistakes credit unions also typically offer more assistance with budgeting and financial responsibility if that has been a problem for you in the past 15 x research source credit unions typically only allow certain types of people to be members for example they may only accept employees of certain companies people who live in a certain community or people who fit other criteria check the credit union s website to find out if you meet their membership criteria before you apply you also might ask your employer if there are any credit unions you qualify for because you work there look for a second chance checking account in the united states and some other countries a number of large banks offer second chance checking accounts for people who have a history of troubled banking relationships 16 x research source use these accounts as a last resort they typically have annual fees and may require you to maintain a fairly substantial minimum balance at all times they also may have other requirements that you would have difficulty meeting if you do get a second chance checking account you typically have the option of converting it to a regular account after you maintain it responsibly for a year or longer take a financial education class in the united states the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic which insures consumers bank deposits offers free financial education programs that you can take online in other countries you may be able to find similar services 17 x research source you also can find a lot of information online or in personal finance books at your local library to help you get your financial life in order if your bank account was closed due to overdrafts or bounced checks you may want to use these resources to get a better handle on your finances closely monitor your bank account if you ve had problems in the past keeping up with your finances you may want to check your bank account on a daily basis and make sure you know what s coming in and what s going out and when 18 x research source set up online access to your new bank account so you can check the transactions in real time use a debit card rather than checks which will make it easier for you to keep track of your money since checks can take several days to clear your account stay on top of fees if you open a new bank account make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully and understand what fees you ll be charged and when you ll be charged them this is especially important if you have a second chance checking account as these typically come with more fees than a standard checking account 19 x research source if you regularly take out cash at atms try to do so at your own bank s atm rather than the atm of another bank or third party even if the fee is small these can add up and are easy to forget when you re mentally calculating how much money you have reconcile your bank statement every month your bank will send you a statement every month whether electronically or in the mail even if you review your transactions online regularly it s still important to go through this statement deadlines to report errors or fraudulent transactions or to dispute transactions or fees often are connected to the date the statement was issued for this reason it s important to review your statement and make sure everything is correct keep your own records and keep track of your receipts you may want to use an online finance app for this purpose most require you to pay for a subscription but some are free set up reminders for automatic payments if you ve set up automatic payments for your bills a reminder a few days or even a week before will ensure that you check your bank account and make sure there s enough money there to cover the bill 20 x research source the reminder also puts the payment to the front of your mind so you remember to mentally discount your balance by that amount link a savings account if you have the means to do so opening a checking and savings account at the same bank and linking the two accounts can help you avoid overdrafting your checking account in the future 21 x research source when you have a linked savings account if your transactions exceed your balance your bank will automatically transfer money from your savings account or draw from the savings account rather than from your checking account check for and be aware of fees for doing this some banks will only withdraw a certain amount from your savings account at a time to cover overdrafts and others charge a fee for this service which may be as high as the fee they would charge for an overdraft or bounced check,Finance-and-Business
how to write a bank authorization letter,if you d like to authorize someone else to handle money in your bank account most banks give several options you have the option to give the person financial power of attorney and specify which transactions they re allowed to make alternatively you can change your account to give someone else access each bank has its own requirements and special forms you ll need to fill out so it s a good idea to contact your bank directly to find out what method is best for your situation,look into granting financial power of attorney for limited transactions most banks won t allow someone not listed on your account to make transactions in your name unless you have given explicit permission in legal terms this means granting the person financial power of attorney fpoa by signing a legal document stating what transactions the person is allowed to make by giving someone fpoa you can authorize them to make withdrawals write checks for you and take other actions in your absence 1 x research source a limited fpoa puts a limit on what the person can do with your account you can authorize them to make a few specific transactions if that s all you want them to do if you want the person to have longer term access to your account you can grant a durable fpoa this enables the person to make decisions for you and handle your finances in the event that you become incapacitated contact your bank for a power of attorney form most major banks have a specific power of attorney form sometimes called a third party authorization form for you to fill out with the details of your situation 2 x research source you ll provide information on to whom you re granting power of attorney which transactions you want the person to be able to take and for how long they re authorized to have access to your account either visit your bank in person to speak to an agent or visit your bank s website to obtain a power of attorney form online fill out and submit the form according to your bank s instructions create your own power of attorney form if your bank doesn t have a specific power of attorney form you can create your own listing exactly what transactions the person is allowed to make in order for the document to be legally valid you will need to follow your state s laws in order to draw it up using the correct language execute sign the power of attorney form with the person to whom you re giving fpoa 3 x research source you may want to have a lawyer help you draw up the form to make sure it s legally sound the execution of the document must also be done according to your state s laws some states require that you have a witness and others require that you have the document notarized present the document to your bank once you have your forms filled out and signed according to the requirements of your state laws visit your bank and meet with an agent to submit the form and make your intentions clear once the form is put on file the other party will now be authorized to make the transactions you laid out consider opening a convenience account about half the states in the us provide the option of opening convenience accounts the other person would have access to the account but would only be authorized to use it on your behalf in other words the person could use it to pay your bills but they couldn t withdraw cash to use for their own purposes 4 x research source this is not an option in every state see if your state s laws permit convenience accounts contact your bank to find out whether a convenience account will meet your needs look into adding someone as a co owner every bank gives you the option of adding a co owner to the account to create a joint account this person would have the exact same ability to make transactions as you do go online or talk to a bank representative in person to add another person to your account 5 x research source in order to add a co owner you ll need to fill out forms that are signed by both parties once the forms are completed and submitted the other person will be granted full access to the account use caution when allowing someone else full access to your account opening a convenience account or a joint account are both risky options adding a co owner gives that person free reign to use your account in whatever way they please even if you just open a convenience account you have to trust the person to use your money wisely in either situation be sure you have full trust in the person who has access to your account 6 x research source you may want to meet with a lawyer to discuss which option is best for your situation the lawyer may advise you against getting a joint account and instead recommend getting a durable fpoa it s a good idea to think it through with an expert before making a decision this is especially true if you re considering adding your children to your bank account so they can take care of your bills unanticipated problems could arise at a later time so make sure your finances are well protected 7 x research source authorize someone to make a deposit if all you want to do is allow someone to deposit money in your account some banks allow people to do this without special authorization depending on what bank you use you may not need to write an official letter or fill out any forms contact your bank for more information on its policies regarding third party deposits 8 x research source authorize someone to make a withdrawal giving someone your bank card or account information is a way to self authorize them to make a withdrawal however banks advise against doing this since you won t have control over how much the person withdraws from your account some banks have explicit policies in place to prevent non account holders from making transactions so using fpoa or listing the person as a co signer may be a better bet,Finance-and-Business
how to calculate bank interest on savings,while interest earned on savings deposits may sometimes be simple to calculate by multiplying the interest rate by the principle in most cases it is not quite so easy for instance many savings accounts quote an annual rate yet compound interest monthly each month a fraction of the annual interest is calculated and added to your balance which in turn affects the following months calculation this cycle of interest being calculated in increments and added to your balance continuously is called compounding and the easiest way to calculate a future balance is using a compound interest formula read on to learn the ins and outs of this type of interest calculation,know the formula for calculating the effect of compound interest the formula for calculating compound interest accumulation on a given account balance is a p 1 rn n t displaystyle a p 1 frac r n n t p is the principal p r is the annual rate of interest and n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year a is the balance of the account you are calculating including the effects of interest t represents the periods of time over which the interest is accumulating it should match with the interest rate you are using e g if the interest rate is an annual rate t should be a number fraction years to determine the appropriate fraction of years for a given time period simply divide the total number of months by 12 or divide the total number of days by 365 determine the variables used in the formula review the terms of your personal savings account or contact a representative from your bank to fill in the equation the principal p represents either the initial amount deposited into the account or the current amount that you will be measuring from for your interest calculation the interest rate r should be in decimal form a 3 interest rate should be entered as 0 03 to get this number simply divide the stated percentage rate by 100 the value of n is the number of times per year the interest is calculated and added onto your balance aka compounds interest most commonly compounds monthly n 12 quarterly n 4 or yearly n 1 but there can be other options depending on your specific account terms 1 x research source the standard interest rates for many savings accounts are typically around 1 8 2 x expert source benjamin packard financial advisor expert interview 11 march 2020 plug your values into the formula once you have determined the amounts of each variable insert them into the compound interest formula to determine the interest earned over the specified time scale for example using the values p 1000 r 0 05 5 n 4 compounded quarterly and t 1 year we get the following equation a 1000 1 0 054 4 1 displaystyle a 1000 1 frac 0 05 4 4 1 interest compounded daily is found in a similar way except you would substitute 365 for the 4 used above for variable n 3 x research source crunch the numbers now that the numbers are in it s time to solve the formula start by simplifying the simple parts of the equation this includes dividing the annual rate by the number of periods to get the periodic rate in this case 0 054 0 0125 displaystyle frac 0 05 4 0 0125 and solving the object n t displaystyle n t which here is just 4 1 displaystyle 4 1 this will yield the following equation a 1000 1 0 0125 4 displaystyle a 1000 1 0 0125 4 this is then further simplified by solving for the object within the parenthesis 1 0 0125 1 0125 displaystyle 1 0 0125 1 0125 the equation will now look like this a 1000 1 0125 4 displaystyle a 1000 1 0125 4 solve the equation next solve the exponent by raising the result of the last step to the power of four aka 1 0125 1 0125 1 0125 1 0125 displaystyle 1 0125 1 0125 1 0125 1 0125 this will give you 1 051 displaystyle 1 051 your equation is now simply a 1000 1 051 displaystyle a 1000 1 051 multiply these two numbers together to get a 1051 displaystyle a 1051 this is your account value with 5 interest compounded quarterly after one year note that this is slightly higher than 1000 5 displaystyle 1000 5 that you may have expected when the annual interest rate was quoted to you this illustrates the importance of understanding how and when your interest compounds the interest earned is the difference between a and p so total interest earned 1051 1000 51 displaystyle 1051 1000 51 use the accumulated savings formula first you can also calculate interest on an account to which you are making regular monthly contributions this is useful if you save a certain amount each month and put that money into your savings account the full equation is as follows a p 1 rn nt pmt 1 rn nt 1rn displaystyle a p 1 frac r n nt pmt frac 1 frac r n nt 1 frac r n 4 x research source an easy approach is to separate the compounding interest for the principal from that of the monthly contributions or payments pmt to begin calculate the interest on the principal first using the accumulated savings formula as has been described with this formula you can calculate the interest earned on your savings account with recurring monthly deposits and interest compounded daily monthly or quarterly 5 x research source use the second part of the formula to calculate the interest on your contributions pmt represents your monthly contribution amount identify your variables check your account or investment agreement to find the following variables principal p the annual rate of interest r and the number of periods per year n if these variables are not readily available to you contact your bank and ask for this information the variable t represents the number of years or portions of years being calculated and pmt represents the payment contribution made each month the account value a represents the total value of the account after your chosen time period and contributions the principal p represents either the balance of the account on the date that you will be starting the calculation from the interest rate r represents the interest paid on the account each year it should be expressed as a decimal in the equation that is a 3 interest rate should be entered as 0 03 to get this number simply divide the stated percentage rate by 100 the value of n simply represents the number of times the interest is compounded each year this should be 365 for interest compounded daily 12 for monthly and 4 for quarterly similarly the value for t represents the number of years you will be calculating your future interest for this should be either the number of years or the portion of a year if you are measuring less than a year e g 0 0833 1 12 for one month 6 x research source input your values into the formula using the example of p 1000 r 0 05 5 n 12 compounded monthly t 3 years and pmt 100 we get the following equation a 1000 1 0 0512 12 3 100 1 0 0512 12 3 10 0512 displaystyle a 1000 1 frac 0 05 12 12 3 100 frac 1 frac 0 05 12 12 3 1 frac 0 05 12 simplify the equation begin by simplifying the object rn displaystyle frac r n where possible by dividing the rate 0 05 by 12 this simplifies to a 1000 1 0 00417 12 3 100 1 0 00417 12 3 10 00417 displaystyle a 1000 1 0 00417 12 3 100 frac 1 0 00417 12 3 1 0 00417 you can also simplify by adding one to the rate within the parentheses the equation will now look like this a 1000 1 00417 12 3 100 1 00417 12 3 10 00417 displaystyle a 1000 1 00417 12 3 100 frac 1 00417 12 3 1 0 00417 solve the exponents first solve the figures within the exponents n t displaystyle n t which give 12 3 36 displaystyle 12 3 36 then solve the exponents to simplify the equation to a 1000 1 1616 100 1 1616 10 00417 displaystyle a 1000 1 1616 100 frac 1 1616 1 0 00417 simplify by subtracting the one to get a 1000 1 1616 100 0 16160 00417 displaystyle a 1000 1 1616 100 frac 0 1616 0 00417 make the final calculations multiply the first part of the equation to get 1 616 solve the second part of the equation by first dividing the numerator by the denominator of the fraction to get 0 16160 00417 38 753 displaystyle frac 0 1616 0 00417 38 753 multiply this number by the value of the payment in this case 100 to get the second part of the equation our equation is now a 1616 3875 30 5 491 30 displaystyle a 1616 3875 30 5 491 30 the account value under these conditions would be 5 491 30 displaystyle 5 491 30 calculate your total interest earned in this equation actual interest earned would be the total amount a minus the principal p and the number of payments times the payment amount pmt n t so in the example interest 5491 30 1000 100 12 3 displaystyle interest 5491 30 1000 100 12 3 and then 5491 30 1000 3600 891 30 displaystyle 5491 30 1000 3600 891 30 7 x research source open a new spreadsheet excel and other similar spreadsheet programs e g google sheets allow you to save time on the math behind these calculations and even offer shortcuts in the form of built in financial functions to help you calculate compounding interest label your variables when using a spreadsheet it s always helpful to be as organized and clear as possible start by labeling a column of cells with the key information you ll be using in your calculation e g interest rate principal time n payment type in your variables now fill out the data you have about your specific account in the next column over this not only makes the the spreadsheet easier to read and interpret later it also leaves room for you to change one or more of your variables later on in order to look at different possible savings scenarios create your equation the next step is to type in your own version of the accumulated interest equation a p 1 rn n t displaystyle a p 1 frac r n n t or the extended version which takes into account your regular monthly contributions to the account a p 1 rn nt pmt 1 rn nt 1rn displaystyle a p 1 frac r n nt pmt frac 1 frac r n nt 1 frac r n use any blank cell begin with an and use normal math conventions parentheses as necessary to type the appropriate equation instead of entering variables like p and n type in the corresponding cell names where you have stored those data values or else simply click the appropriate cell while editing your equation use financial functions excel also offers certain financial functions that may help your calculation specifically future value fv may be of use because it calculates the value of an account at some point in the future given the same set of variables you ve now become accustomed to to access this function go to any blank cell and type fv excel should then bring up a guidance window as soon as you open the function parenthesis in order to help you insert the appropriate parameters into your function 8 x research source the future value function is designed with paying an account balance down as it continues to accumulate interest instead of with accumulating savings account interest because of this it automatically yields a negative number counteract this issue by typing 1 fv displaystyle 1 fv the fv function takes similar data parameters separated by commas but not exactly the same ones for instance rate refers to r n displaystyle r n the annual interest rate divided by n this will calculate automatically from within the fv function s parenthesis the parameter nper refers to the variable n t displaystyle n t the total number of periods over which interest is accumulating and the total number of payments in other words if your pmt is not 0 the fv function will assume you are contributing the pmt amount across each and every period as defined by nper note that this function is most often used for things like calculating how a mortgage principal is paid down over time by regular payments for instance if you plan to contribute every month for 5 years nper would be 60 5 years 12 months pmt is your regular contribution amount over the entire period one contribution per n pv aka present value is the principal amount your account s starting balance the final variable type can be left blank for this calculation when it is the function sets it automatically to 0 the fv function allows for you to do basic calculations within the function parameters for instance the completed fv function could look like 1 fv 05 12 12 100 5000 displaystyle 1 fv 05 12 12 100 5000 this would signify a 5 annual interest rate which compounded monthly for 12 months over which time you contribute 100 month and your starting principal balance is 5000 the answer to this function will tell you the account balance after 1 year 6483 70,Finance-and-Business

how to prepare a bank reconciliation,a bank reconciliation is a critical tool for managing your cash balance reconciling is the process of comparing the cash activity in your accounting records to the transactions in your bank statement this process helps you monitor all of the cash inflows and outflows in your bank account the reconciliation process also helps you identify fraud and other unauthorized cash transactions as a result it is critical for you to reconcile your bank account within a few days of receiving your bank statement,examine the bank statement balance access your bank statement as soon as possible if you have online access to your account your bank statement should be available shortly after that last day of the month when you get the statement note the month end balance your goal is to reconcile any differences between the bank balance and your cash account records 1 x research source this means checking whether each transaction appears both in your own records and on your bank statement in a bank statement debits refer to withdrawals from the bank account and credits refer to deposits to the bank account these definitions are different from how the accounting profession uses these terms if an item appears only in one place the bank statement or your cash account it is a reconciling item your goal is to identify the reason the two records don t match and correct them until they do a bank reconciliation can be thought of as a formula the formula is cash account balance per your records plus or minus reconciling items bank statement balance when you have this formula in balance your bank reconciliation is complete your cash account balance defined as your book balance or balance per book the bank statement balance is the balance per bank the difference between these two balances is due to reconciling items increase the bank balance for any deposits that have not posted also known as deposits in transit there may be a delay between the time you make a deposit at the bank and the time the deposit is posted as an increase to your bank account if you deposit funds at an atm or at the bank branch the delay may be brief if you mail a deposit the delay can be longer 2 x research source you increase your cash account for the amount of the deposit immediately the bank s delay in posting the deposit means that you have a reconciling item the bank statement balance would need to be credited or increased to reflect the true amount of cash for example assume your bank balance was 5 000 you deposited 1 500 on july 31st your july bank statement does not include the 1 500 deposit to reconcile the balance you would add 1 500 to the bank statement balance increasing the bank balance to 6 500 the 1 500 is a reconciling item decrease the bank balance for all outstanding checks a cleared check refers to a check that has posted to the bank s records any check that has not been cleared by the bank is called an outstanding check this situation occurs when checks are written in the last day or two of the month outstanding checks need to be deducted from the bank balance 3 x research source assume that the bank balance is 5 000 to account for deposits properly you increase the bank balance for 1 500 in deposits in transit your change adjusts the bank balance to 5 000 1 500 6 500 say that 5 checks totaling 3 000 are outstanding at the end of the month to account for outstanding checks you decrease the adjusted bank balance by 3 000 your new adjusted bank balance is 6 500 3 000 3 500 make sure to check the prior month s statement as well to ensure that any outstanding checks from the previous period have cleared this month if a check has yet to clear contact the payee the person who should receive the payment to learn why if the check is still outstanding after a month it may be lost check for any errors made by the bank s processing department if you re reconciling a business cash account your accounting is posted to general ledger a business should compare the cash account s general ledger to the bank statement activity you may come across a transaction that you cannot fully explain if you re unclear about a business or personal bank transaction contact your bank 4 x research source one possible error comes from transposing or reversing the numbers on a deposit amount or check for example the bank may mistakenly record a 570 deposit instead of a 750 deposit this always results in an error that is a multiple of nine 180 in this example contact your bank and ask them to make a correction to remove the reconciling item if the discrepancy isn t a bank error it may represent fraudulent activity assume that a secretary manages a dental office the checkbook is on the front desk when the secretary is at lunch a visitor steals a check from the checkbook and cashes it when the check posts to the bank account it is a fraudulent transaction assume also that the dentist notices the cashed check in the bank statement the dentist calls the bank and the bank adds funds back to the account that removes the reconciling item verify that all checks have posted when your company receives the bank statement you should print a report listing all of the checks written and deposits made during the month a company will probably have accounting software that can provide reports if you re reconciling your personal bank account you should review your check register and your deposit slips a company should print the cash reports and also review the check register and deposit slips review all of the checks you have written in numbered order verify that the check posted to your bank statement if the check cleared your bank indicate that in your records you can document the cleared check using accounting software or using a manual report you should also review checks written in the prior month review to see if those checks posted to the current month s bank statement if the check cleared indicate that fact in your records if the check has not cleared contact the payee the check may be lost when you finish your review you should create a list of each check that has not posted to the bank account that list should include the check number the dollar amount and the payee the total dollar amount represents your outstanding checks for the month outstanding checks are a reconciling item confirm that all deposits have posted a business should print a list of all deposits made for the month the company should also review all deposits slips if you re reconciling your personal account you should have a list of deposits in your checkbook along with your deposit slips 5 x research source when you receive your bank statement review the deposits that posted to the bank s records for the month review all of your checkbook deposits in order by date confirm that each deposit posted to the bank statement you should also review any deposits in transit at the end of the prior month confirm that those deposits posted to the bank statement for the current month when you finish your review you should create a list of each deposit that has not posted to the bank account that list should include the deposit amount and the date of the deposit the total dollar amount represents your deposits in transit for the month deposits in transit are a reconciling item subtract any service charges and automated debits you need to deduct all bank charges from your cash account one type of bank charge is a monthly service charge you may also be charged if you overdraw your account balance most of these charges are posted to your bank statement but may not be posted to your cash account at month end you also need to adjust your cash records for interest earned on your bank account balance 6 x research source if a 10 service fee is posted to the bank statement for example it would need to be deducted from the cash account until you post the amount to your cash records it is a reconciling item add any interest earned on your account balance you don t typically know about interest your account has earned until a bank statement arrives add any interest the bank has credited to your cash account balance until you post the interest to your records the amount is a reconciling item deduct any automatic payments many accounts may have automatic monthly payments set up for certain recurring bills if you don t have the payment date for auto payments on your calendar you may not see the withdrawal until it appears on the monthly bank statement review your bank statement post any missing automated debit payments to your cash account this step will remove a reconciling item deduct any nsf checks if the bank statement indicates that a not sufficient funds check bounced during the month that means that the check amount was not deposited to your account you will have to deduct the check amount from your cash account records if the bank charges you a fee for depositing a bad check you will also need to deduct that amount you will also be charged if you overdraw your account check for any errors you ve made during the month as you compare your cash account activity to the bank you may find errors that you made for example you might post the wrong dollar amount for a check or deposit to your cash records those errors will create a reconciling item 7 x research source if your balance is off by a multiple of nine for example 270 or 630 you have likely made a transposition error this means you accidentally switched the order of two digits in a deposit for example you may have filled out a check for 310 but recorded it in your records as 130 once you finish all of your reconciliation work your cash account balance plus or minus all reconciling items should equal the balance per the bank statement if that formula does not equal review your work until you account for all of the reconciling items correctly 8 x research

require any special training to determine its value is considered damaged damaged bills typically include dirty worn out slightly torn or defaced bills these bills can be simply exchanged at your local bank make sure the currency you are exchanging is valid in the united states this is typically not a problem however elsewhere it is important to make sure the currency is still accepted as legal tender or exchangeable this can typically be determined either by searching online for the name and value of the currency or by calling a bank and asking check values if it is very old currency it may be worth more than face value there are some notes that are worth more to collectors than the face value for example silver backed one dollar bills from the u s typically sell for more than 1 in decent condition if this is the case you should always confirm its value if you think your currency is old and may have value check websites that post values by searching collectible currency values this will provide a list of price guides papermoneyguide com or coinquest com could be good starting resources this is important to consider before simply replacing the currency at the bank if you have currency from the early 1900s for example it may be worth more than the face value and is therefore worthwhile to confirm its value before exchanging generally the older the currency the more valuable it could be call around to find a local bank that can exchange currency some banks will only exchange worn ripped or currency in poor condition for its own customers other banks are willing to do it for anyone it is probably a good idea to call the branch to check if you are headed to a bank where you do not have an account exchange worn currency at a local bank currency that is still valid but is simply worn ripped or in otherwise poor condition can be replaced at a bank deposit the money into any account and the bank s relationship with their country s central bank and minting service will ensure that it is swapped for fresh currency you can also just ask to swap it out without depositing it 4 x research source find out if the currency is still exchangeable sometimes a new government or central bank takes over and phases out an old currency other times a merger with another currency replaces another the most common example of the latter is the euro replacing francs lira german marks and other european currencies most countries that went to the euro set a final date to exchange old currency for the first countries that made the change such as france and germany the final date was in 2012 this means that after this point old francs are just paper with no value for exchange 5 x research source locate a bank to make the exchange if you are in the currency s home country it should not be hard to swap the old currency for a new one follow the same steps in method 1 at this point however if you are not located in the currency s home country you will have to call banks to see if they can make the exchange check different banks for the best exchange rate and lowest fees if you are making the swap outside the home country for that currency find the best exchange rate and check on the fees since few financial institutions will have the new notes on hand a bank will often require you to change the money into dollars or a common currency every institution will use a slightly different exchange rate so call around to find the best one exchange the money the actual exchange process is very simple the bank will simply take in your old notes and issue new ones if you are exchanging a foreign currency for dollars the bank should also provide a receipt that includes the exchange rate used and any fees find a third party dealer or currency exchange service third party money changers can often handle notes that some banks will not accept for exchange banks sometimes will not accept money from a country that is not frequently visited other times they will not deal with changing an expired currency for a new one shop for the best rate and lowest fees at a third party service every dealer and currency exchange will make money on the spread this is the difference between what they pay for a currency and what they sell it for because the differences are dramatic at times search for the best rate and lowest fees by calling and writing down the rates from different dealers don t forget to ask about any additional fees a dealer should be able to quote you an exchange rate based on the spot price for that currency remember currency markets move so the rate today is not necessarily the rate tomorrow replace old european currency using a third party service if you can t get to a bank in the issuing country you can contact a third party company that handles currency redemption while if you hold old francs you are out of luck lithuanian litas for example are still convertible into euros 6 x research source companies like travelex specialize in changing currencies 7 x research source several companies of this type exist to provide redemption for defunct currency these companies work by buying old money from customers at a low rate and exchanging it in bulk with national banks the currency commission is one such company using this type of service will provide a lower rate for your exchange but may be your only option once the issuing government s exchange deadline has passed deal with expired currency if the currency is past its deadline there may not be any option for exchanging sometimes collectors may have interest if it is rare otherwise you may just have some nicely decorated paper check ebay to see if it has any value to anyone,Finance-and-Business

how to calculate apy on a bank savings account,when you put money into a savings account the bank generally reports the annual percentage rate apr and the frequency of compounding interest a lower interest rate with more frequent compounding could result in higher earnings calculating annual percentage yield apy tells you how much you can expect to earn by the end of the year using the formula apy 1 rn n 1 displaystyle text apy 1 frac r n n 1 will let you calculate the apy if you know the interest rate and compounding frequency,gather the necessary data you need to know two pieces of information to perform this calculation 1 x research source interest rate r this is the interest rate that the bank quotes for savings accounts of your type pay attention to the different rates for different types of accounts for example a money market account will generally have a higher interest rate than a savings account and a savings account will have a higher interest rate than a checking account if the checking account earns any interest at all the rate should be expressed as a decimal so a number like 3 would be used as 0 03 compounding frequency n ask a lending official at the bank how often the bank compounds interest per year use the apy formula there is a fairly simple formula for calculating the apy based on the annual interest rate and the number of times interest is compounded this formula is 2 x research source apy 1 rn n 1 displaystyle text apy 1 frac r n n 1 apply the data and perform the calculation suppose for example your bank advertises a 1 interest rate on savings accounts and compounds interest quarterly this means that r 0 01 displaystyle r 0 01 and n 4 displaystyle n 4 apply these figures to the calculation as follows 3 x research source apy 1 rn n 1 displaystyle text apy 1 frac r n n 1 apy 1 014 4 1 displaystyle text apy 1 frac 01 4 4 1 apy 1 00254 1 displaystyle text apy 1 0025 4 1 apy 0 010038 displaystyle text apy 0 010038 you probably need an advanced calculator to perform the exponent function for this calculation most simple calculators have at most a button for squaring a number you will need a more advanced calculator with a button to raise the number to any chosen exponent interpret the result notice that for this example the apy result is very nearly the same as the bank s interest rate the increase is only 0 0038 even so if you have a large amount of money invested over time this increase can add up 4 x research source try a different example suppose as a second example the bank offers the same 1 0 interest rate but compounds the interest daily rather than quarterly in this case the rate is the same r 0 01 displaystyle r 0 01 but n 365 displaystyle n 365 5 x research source technically the number of days in a year is probably more accurately represented as 365 25 that difference could become meaningful with large amounts of money for this example however just use n 365 displaystyle n 365 apy 1 rn n 1 displaystyle text apy 1 frac r n n 1 apy 1 01365 365 1 displaystyle text apy 1 frac 01 365 365 1 apy 1 0025365 1 displaystyle text apy 1 0025 365 1 apy 0 01005 displaystyle text apy 0 01005 interpret the new result when the same interest rate is compounded daily rather than quarterly the apy increases from 1 0038 to 1 005 again when working with large amounts of money over time this difference gains higher significance 6 x research source collect information about your savings another way to calculate the apy is to work backward from your actual savings to determine the rate that you earned to perform this calculation you need the following information 7 x research source interest this is the amount of interest that you earned over a specified period of time you will need good bank records or a periodic bank report to get this number principal this is the amount of money that you held in your account to earn the interest if the amount of principal changes over time you will need to perform separate calculations for each time period that the principal is constant and add them together days this is the number of days that the principal remained in the account when the interest accrued use the alternate apy formula when you know the amount of money in your account and the amount of interest that you earned you can calculate the apy with the following formula 8 x research source apy 100 1 ip 365d 1 displaystyle text apy 100 1 frac i p frac 365 d 1 i displaystyle i is the interest earned p displaystyle p is the amount of principal d displaystyle d is the number of days insert the data and perform the calculation suppose you learn that you earned 60 interest on a savings account that started with 5 000 over half a year 182 5 days use this information to calculate the apy that you received 9 x research source apy 100 1 ip 365d 1 displaystyle text apy 100 1 frac i p frac 365 d 1 apy 100 1 605000 365182 5 1 displaystyle text apy 100 1 frac 60 5000 frac 365 182 5 1

4144 the final step of the calculation multiplying by 100 is just to transform the decimal figure into a percentage search the internet while the calculations for apy are not too difficult you can simplify the job even more by using an apy calculator online many banks or other websites offer this simple service run a search for apy calculator and you should find what you want the calculation is standard so you will want to choose one that has a style and presentation that you can read easily 10 x research source be careful to read the calculator site carefully some offer to help you calculate apy while others offer to calculate your savings after you enter the apy either is fine as long as you know what you are using this article focuses on calculating the apy itself enter the advertised percentage rate the first box of the online calculator will usually ask you to enter the bank s interest rate usually you will be prompted to enter the figure as a percentage rather than a decimal 11 x research source for example if the calculator asks you to enter a percentage you will enter the number 1 for a 1 interest rate if you were asked for a decimal then you would have to convert it to 0 01 enter the compounding frequency you may be asked to enter the number of times that the interest is compounded in that case you enter a number alternatively you may be asked for a compounding frequency with options like daily monthly or quarterly read the choices carefully and select the correct one 12 x research source for example if you are working with a bank that compounds interest quarterly then you would either enter the number 4 for 4 times a year or the word quarterly you will have to read the instructions on the website to make the correct choice press the button to calculate after you enter the information you should find a calculate button when you press that the equivalent apy should appear 13 x research source,Finance-and-Business

how to avoid being charged overdraft fees,if your checking account shows a negative balance your financial institution can penalize you with a charge known as an overdraft fee such a fee can be expensive and frustrating 1 x research source this article discusses several ways to prevent overdraft fees from occurring,select an overdraft option your bank may offer a service that limits or completely eliminates overdraft fees typically you have three such options overdraft coverage a limited coverage in which the bank will honor a check that pulls your balance below zero anticipating that you will reimburse them in the immediate future overdraft protection the bank will automatically withdraw funds from another of your accounts or grant you a line of credit in the event of an overdraft a line of credit typically involves interest payments and transaction fees complete opt out you re under no obligation to have any overdraft protection at all if you opt out one or more of your checks could be rejected in such a case you might be charged an overdraft fee ask to have an overdraft charge eliminated if you very rarely overdraw an account you ve maintained for a long time approach a customer service representative about having the overdraft fee removed many banks will waive such a fee for normally reliable customers negotiate if you have a series of overdraft charges your bank may consider waiving a series of charges stemming from the same overdraft if you re willing to set up a savings account for automatic overdraft protection as an added incentive you could offer to accept other services with the bank in exchange for eliminating the fees avoid relying on your available balance it s tempting to accept the available balance shown on your atm receipt however that figure does not reflect checks that haven t yet been presented for payment outstanding checks or bank card purchases that haven t been processed yet you may also have some automatic payments that will occur within the next few days keep your check register up to date the best way to ascertain your available balance is to keep your check register up to date immediately record every transaction so that you have an accurate record of checks that will soon be presented for payment that will let you know how much money you have available find out if your bank or credit union has an app to help you maintain your check register 2 x research source check with your bank about online services many banks offer a portfolio of services to help their customers manage money if you prefer managing your register on paper do it consistently so that you know that your available balance is accurate balance your checkbook a pending overdraft fee may indicate that you haven t balanced your checkbook lately do this regularly in search of arithmetical errors or failure to record transactions include bank card purchases in your register if you occasionally make bank card purchases be sure to note them in your register such purchases like checks often take a few days to clear remember that deposited checks including paychecks take time to post to your account it s best to wait a day or two before drawing on those deposits the bank can tell you when those funds will be available for use try the envelope system one way to avoid overdraft fees is to use mainly cash in your transactions you can do that and stay within budget by using the envelope system 3 x research source take several envelopes and label them according to budget items gasoline eating out groceries etc at the beginning of the month take out cash from your account and put the amount that s budgeted for each expense item in the envelope with the appropriate label for example if you ve budgeted 100 for gasoline for the month put 100 in the envelope labeled gasoline when you want to buy something within your budget do so by pulling the cash out of the appropriate envelope if it s time to spend 20 for gasoline pull 20 out of that envelope and use it to pay for your fuel create an artificial buffer give yourself a cushion in the event something goes wrong or you make an error when balancing your checkbook set a lower limit for your balance and never let it fall below that for example you might prefer never to let your account fall below 100 perhaps 500 if you write a lot of checks or often write big checks 4 x research source some accounts require a minimum balance to avoid fees fees for going below a minimum balance are generally smaller than overdraft fees but they are still an unnecessary expense ask your bank or credit union if they have such fees and what their requirements are for your minimum balance if you re trying to build up savings maintain your own minimum balance above whatever the bank requires and raise that minimum every month besides creating your own insurance against overdraft fees you ll also be providing a cash cushion which can help you avoid going into debt in case of a financial emergency or unexpected expense ask about your bank s policy regarding deposits and payments some banks will process payments prior to processing deposits that means if you have a deposit and a payment on the same day your account could drop below zero if the payment is processed before the deposit understand the policy and schedule your payments accordingly look into your bank s policy regarding the crediting of deposits you might find that corporate paychecks clear sooner than handwritten checks do familiarize yourself with the bank s policies about how long it takes certain checks to clear so that you know when you can expect the money to be credited to your account,Finance-and-Business

courts however some government entities like the irs or creditors could allow you to enter into payment arrangements decide how to move forward prepare the paperwork to appeal the assignment in tandem with trying to reach an agreement with the creditor the timeline is short often only ten days to challenge the attachment if you do not successfully resolve the dispute directly with the creditor you

state is different but exempt funds can include those for basic life necessities wages child support retirement funds and social security you will need to identify the reasons the funds are exempt or that the attachment is not valid 2 x research source the treasury department has rules in place that prevent attachments of funds that are linked to social security benefits paid in the prior two months the bank is supposed to review the account for any social security deposits and it is not supposed to freeze these funds attach supporting documentation to the filing you will need to support any claims so attach pay stubs utility bills bank statements court ruling for child support or anything else that helps demonstrate your case to the court file the paperwork with the court sheriff or levying officer make at least three copies of every form to file with the court sheriff or levying officer the directions for where to file the paperwork should be on the notice of levy that you received the process varies by location so the original notice is your best resource for filing location wait for a response if the creditor agrees or takes no action to your filing typically within 10 days the exemption is granted you will have the money returned to you at this time if the creditor opposes the claim you will receive notice of a court hearing follow the local process in some counties and cities there is a tentative ruling released the day prior to the hearing you can check this on the clerk of courts website typically in other states you will have to attend the hearing to receive a ruling get the results if you had the hearing the judge will make a ruling on your exemption claim it can be for all partial or none of the amount in the attachment after the ruling you will

many people open accounts quickly and without planning if you seek to open an account whether savings checking or money market you should find out about the fees that are connected to it some of these fees are within the bank s control while others may be the result of federal regulations in either case it is your duty as the account holder to understand the fees that you face 13 x research source for example federal banking regulations limit the number of withdrawals per month that you can make from a money market account if you need regular access to your money you might get charged excessive fees if you open the wrong account too quickly read and react to notices from your bank if your bank is going to institute a new fee or increase the charges on an existing fee they must provide you with notice before enacting these changes these notices often come in your monthly bank statement too many people disregard the details of these notices and as a result are not aware of the change in fees to avoid getting caught off guard you should check you monthly statement carefully and read the details of any notices that are included 14 x research source if you receive notice of a new or increasing fee you should decide what action you can take to minimize the impact of the change for example if you receive a notice that your bank is going to start charging for atm use you can then

amount of total charges that you could face for example if your bank charges a monthly maintenance fee for each account then having three accounts open will triple the amount of the fee that you pay carrying multiple accounts also increases the possibility that your minimum balances may drop below allowed levels 15 x research source for example some people might open separate accounts for household spending child care expenses and college savings while on the face these seem to make sense you subject yourself to multiple fees a better plan would be to combine these into a single account and then keep your own private records of the subcategories keep your bank aware of any address change if you move you need to notify your bank of your new address right away some banks charge

forgot to record a check that you had written and then did not have sufficient funds to cover the check you could explain this has never happened to me before but i somehow forgot to record the check and i was not expecting the money to come out of my account or i would not have written any additional checks by showing that your conduct was accidental the bank may be more inclined to help you

argument about your loyalty to the bank if you are a longstanding customer you can argue that the bank should remove the fee as a courtesy to you banks do not want to lose their longstanding customers over a fee dispute you can use this to your advantage you can say to the bank employee i have been a loyal customer for a number of years and i would hope that the bank would want to assist a customer who has never really had any issues before this moment if the employee fails to help you you can always state that you think it may be time to transfer to another bank if this is how your current bank wants to treat you while these arguments may not work many banks will waive a fee to keep a good customer 6 x research source ask to speak with a supervisor if the customer service representative

your local branch if speaking to a customer service representative and his or her supervisor doesn t help you should consider visiting your local branch and meeting with a bank employee face to face it is more difficult to turn someone s request down when they are sitting in front of you you should explain what happened and ask that the fee be removed if the fee was for failing to keep a minimum

better than smaller ones that said the convenience of online banking including the availability of easy to use apps for your phone is important at a minimum make sure you re able to check your balances and make deposits and payments online a financial institution that doesn t offer these services yet is clearly behind the times consider the availability of physical locations for many financial institutions though not all there will be certain things you need to do in person proximity to a branch location is therefore another factor worth considering especially if you prefer to do your banking in person the availability of atms is also important if you like to be able to withdraw cash easily while bigger banks often have many atms most credit unions belong to the co op system that allows their users to use other credit union s atms without paying a fee check on the fees for in and out of network atms since the latter can be expensive decide based on interest rates rates may or may not be an important factor depending on how much money you keep in deposit accounts if you do tend to keep money in savings and checking accounts you can make money on those deposits from high annual percentage yields online only institutions are often able to offer higher interest rates and thus better returns on your deposits compared to banks with lots of branch locations ask about specific security features you should only bank with a financial institution you can trust in fact financial institutions are increasingly offering the ability to customize your own security settings for instance you can set up text alerts through many mobile banking platforms to notify you about account activity be sure to ask a bank employee about the specific security features their accounts offer another specific security feature you may want is the ability to lock and unlock your debit card as you wish further ensure that debit cards issued by the financial institution you re considering include a chip take customer service seriously as important as online banking is don t underestimate the importance of being able to talk to someone when you need to in this capacity big banks are notoriously inaccessible it can be especially helpful and comforting to speak with a human being via phone or live online chat about anything you have a question about consider maintaining

checking account but consider opening up a new account at an institution that offers the best rates on auto loans visit the consumer reports website and search financial institutions according to the

options for credit cards and mortgages are often financial institutions that are exclusively online credit unions can also be great for mortgages consider banking with a credit union for many people

do have better online banking interfaces and their size may make accessing your money during international travel easier 3 x research source the main difference between these two types of institutions

reports 2 x research source 3 x research source 4 x research source make a reasonable offer if your offer is too small the company is not likely to accept it but if you offer too much you run the risk of not being able to make the payments find a number in the middle that you believe you can justify 5 x research source offer less for older debts the company is likely to believe that older debts are generally less collectible therefore they are more inclined to accept a lower offer a reasonable offer might be something around 15 to 25 percent of the debt 6 x research source realize that a settlement could well impact your credit score negatively anything other than full on time payment will hurt your score to some extent a settlement however is better than waiting until the account goes to collection because it will show that you took some responsibility and addressed the issue directly address the letter to the proper office find out which office of the credit card company handles settlement offers you can usually discover this by looking up the company online or calling the customer service number on the back of the card itself when you reach someone at the company say that you would like to make an offer to settle your debt and ask what address you should use for sending a letter ask if you should address your letter to a particular individual in most cases you will just write to the collections office or something similar but some companies may refer you to a particular individual clearly identify the account that you are discussing at the top of your letter below the address you should state the account number especially if you have more than one account with the institution it is important to state clearly which account you are trying to settle 7 x research source explain your predicament avoid getting emotional about the problems in your life but you should explain your reason for needing to settle your debt it will help your case if you can refer to a particular cause such as an accident divorce or something else that is not likely to repeat if you ve simply overspent the company will be less inclined to settle because they have no assurance that your spending habits will change in the future 8 x research source as an example your letter might begin by saying due to a recent automobile accident and the medical costs i have incurred i find that i am unable to make all my outstanding credit card payments i am writing in the hope of reaching a settlement with you for an amount that i can realistically pay an explanatory letter for a settlement like this may help you with future lenders as well keep a copy of the letter and be prepared to share it potential lenders will be concerned when they see a settlement on your credit history but your explanation will lend context state your offer clearly provide a precise statement of the amount you re offering to pay you should also make it clear whether you re suggesting a one time payment or a payment plan for a number of months either could be acceptable but you should clearly outline your offer 9 x research source an offer of this type could say something like i am able to make an immediate payment of 4 000 in full settlement of my outstanding credit card debt be sure to use the phrase in full settlement so it is clear that you mean this as a full and final payment and not as part of a payment plan if you intend to begin a payment plan you could offer something like this i would like to start a payment plan whereby i would pay you 1 000 by the first of each month for the next six months this 6 000 would constitute full settlement of my outstanding credit card debt provide a date for a response at the end of your letter ask the company to respond to you by a particular date you should allow at least two weeks for the response however even if you do not receive a reply by that date do not assume that your offer has been rejected you should call the company refer to your letter and try to continue the negotiations 10 x research source correspond with a single individual when possible whether you initiated the negotiation by phone or in writing you should find out the name of the individual handling your account address any follow up correspondence directly to this person by name 11 x research source review your prior negotiations in any letters you should make reference to earlier letters or conversations provide a brief history of the negotiations so far this will help maintain context for your current correspondence 12 x research source for example your opening paragraph may say i am writing to follow up on our telephone conversation of july 16 2016 i made an offer to resolve my credit card account with a single payment of 2 000 but you countered by saying that your company would accept 8 000 present a subsequent offer if possible any negotiation involves give and take between the two parties if you can reasonably increase your offer you should include the newest offer in your letter if however you have reached a point you honestly cannot move beyond you should say so the company will then be forced either to accept your offer or proceed with legal action 13 x research source this latest letter could state i appreciate your request for a payment of 8 000 however i cannot meet your request i am able to offer a final payment of 3 500 in full settlement of my outstanding debt negotiate for the most favorable reporting of the settlement if you pay anything less than the full amount due your credit score is likely to drop however you can try to minimize the damage by modifying the way the company reports the settlement ask them to report your account as paid this is best for you if they won t do that suggest that your account be classified as settled the poorest result for you would be a report of charged off or transferred which indicates you have not paid the full amount in that case you might expect to be contacted by a collection agency 14 x research source realize that you really have very little leverage for controlling the way the company reports your account to a credit reporting agency even so it is worth discussing ask for the most favorable treatment you can get keep a copy of all correspondence retain a file of all letters you send and receive you may need to refer to these in the future as you consider further offers 15 x research source send a final letter to complete your negotiations eventually you and the credit card company are likely to reach a settlement when that occurs you must confirm the agreement by putting it in writing 16 x research source recite the entire agreement accurately in your final settlement letter you must make sure to state the terms of the agreement accurately and completely be careful not to leave out any details include all of the following the amount of your agreement the payment deadline even if the agreement is for immediate payment and you are including a check with the letter you must say so periodic payment dates if you are setting up a payment plan the phrase full and final settlement this binds the company legally to this amount and prevents future collection efforts for any additional amounts a description of how the company will report this debt to the credit reporting agencies it makes a difference whether a debt is reported as paid settled or paid late try to negotiate for a reporting of paid provide a space for both signatures you should sign the letter and provide a space at the bottom for a representative of the company to sign indicating the company s agreement send the company two copies of the letter with your original signature in the body of your letter request that the account representative sign one of the letters and return it to you above the signature space include the words agreement accepted then provide a line for the company representative to sign and insert

promissory note is considered unsecured which means that if the borrower is unable to pay there may not be much that you can do about it to secure a promissory note means that you identify some specific property and attach it to the note then if the borrower defaults on the loan you will be able to repossess the collateral as compensation for the loan the method of securing the promissory note varies depending on the type of collateral and the laws where you live,attach the collateral to the loan to attach collateral is a legal term that means you must identify the specific property that will be the collateral for the loan a motor vehicle is pretty easy to identify by its vehicle identification number vin and by a brief description of the make and model as the lender you will need to have your borrower sign a security agreement that contains this description and makes reference to the loan 1 x research source note the loan and security interest on the vehicle title for a loan secured by a motor vehicle you must make note of the security interest on the actual title certificate itself each state will have a slightly different procedure for doing this in general you first need to obtain the original title certificate 2 x research source the owner of the vehicle who is borrowing the money should have the title certificate in some cases if the owner already is paying on a first loan and you are lending money as a second lien on the vehicle then the first lienholder might have the title certificate the borrower would have to contact the first lender to get the title certificate complete the lien section on the title certificate on the back of the title certificate you will find a section to report the details of your loan you will provide the date amount of the loan and signatures of both the borrower owner and the lender 3 x research source file the documents with the appropriate governmental office in most u s states to finalize the procedure of securing the promissory note with a motor vehicle you must deliver the original title certificate and the signed security agreement to the dmv the dmv will then create a new title certificate with the loan formally recorded on it some states will charge a fee for this 4 x research source check with your state s local procedures for example in south dakota instead of the dmv you will need to send the title certificate and security agreement to the county treasurer in the county where the vehicle owner resides there is a 10 fee 5 x research source in tennessee for example you will need to send the financing statement and title certificate to the local county clerk s office there is a fee of 11 for the lien notation and 5 50 for a state title fee there also may be a local county fee 6 x research source begin by having the borrower sign a loan agreement or promissory note a promissory note is just another term for a loan agreement under either title this is a contract that identifies the loan given to the borrower and specifies the terms of repayment 7 x research source have the borrower sign a mortgage agreement a mortgage is a legal term used to describe an agreement between the parties that certain real estate will be given as collateral to secure a loan the simplest mortgage just needs to identify the parties describe the loan and identify the property depending on the

document for you you should have the mortgage witnessed and notarized in some states this is a requirement such that failure to do so will nullify the mortgage in others it may not be required but is still a good practice file the mortgage and loan agreement with the appropriate office to finalize the secured loan with the real estate collateral you must file the completed mortgage and loan agreement with a state office where the property is located the requirements for filing differ from state to state you should check with a local attorney or the secretary of state s office for the state where the property exists to determine the appropriate filing method 9 x research source for example in massachusetts the loan documents are filed with the registry of deeds in the county where the property is located in connecticut mortgages are recorded with the town clerk where the property exists in new york you must file the mortgage with the county clerk for the county where the

john smith an individual and john smith is the president of xyz corporation you will need to identify carefully whether the collateral is owned by john smith or by xyz corporation the person or company giving the collateral should be the same as the person or company getting the benefit of your loan identify the collateral carefully to complete the financing statement you need to identify the parties to the loan and provide an adequate description of the collateral the description must be sufficiently clear so that any third party reading the financing statement will understand what it is meant to cover 11 x research source for example if you intend to secure the loan with a particular photocopy machine that the borrower owns you should identify it by description make model and even serial number if possible on the other hand if you intend to secure the loan with all of the borrower s office equipment you may use a more general description such as equipment other general descriptive terms that are allowable are goods inventory or fixtures you can describe intangible business assets as accounts which includes the borrower s right to receive payments from its customers chattel paper which includes other secured loans that the borrower may have the right to collect or general intangibles which simply includes other intangible assets that are not covered by the first two categories perfect the security interest by filing the loan documents with the appropriate office the most common and most effective method of perfecting a security interest in tangible or intangible business assets is by filing the security agreement and financing statement each state has different regulations for the proper filing location you will need to check with the secretary of state s office for the state where your borrower is located in order to determine the correct place and method for filing if your borrower operates in multiple states you may need to file your loan documents in more than one state in some states you may be required to file with the secretary of state generally in the state capital and also file in the clerk s office for any county within the state where the borrower does business 12 x research source it is a good idea to work with an attorney who is familiar with the laws of the state where you wish to perfect your security interest in order to be sure that you file appropriately if you neglect to file your loan documents in the appropriate offices you may lose your position of priority the borrower will still owe you the money but if another lender files in a place where you have not then that lender may be able to collect the collateral before you take possession of the collateral to perfect a security interest a second method which may be more difficult than filing is to take actual possession of the collateral this is often referred to as repossession you must be careful if using this method that you do so in a peaceful and lawful manner you may not break in to a property to take possession of collateral and you may not take possession in such a way that creates a disturbance 13 x research source take legal control of the collateral to perfect a security interest a final alternative for perfecting a security interest in property is to take control over the collateral this does not require actual possession of the property but it does require you to take sufficient legal steps so that you control what can be done with the collateral this method generally applies to intangible assets like accounts receivable deposit accounts or investment accounts 14 x research source attach the loan to some identified collateral if you are lending to an individual you may wish to secure your promissory note with some of that person s personal property personal property can be anything that is not a motor vehicle or real estate this could include anything of sufficient value such as a big screen television bank accounts valuable antiques or anything else you identify 15 x research source complete a financing statement to attach the collateral to the promissory note to attach the loan to any personal property you will need to have the borrower complete a financing statement which is sometimes also referred to as a ucc or ucc 1 statement a sample ucc 1 is available at http www fullertonlaw com docs appendices 17 ucc 1_financial_statement pdf 16 x research source the financing statement requires you to provide the borrower s name and address the lender s name and address and a description of the collateral the description must be specific enough to identify the property for any third party perfect your security interest to perfect a security interest in personal property the most common method is to file the loan documents with the secretary of state s office in the state where the borrower resides depending on the laws of your state you may also need to file in the county clerk s office or in some other location you should check with an attorney or the secretary of state to verify the filing requirements for your state 17 x research source as with business loans you may also perfect your security interest by taking possession or control over the collateral if using one of these methods you must do so in a peaceful and lawful manner you may not break in to someone s home

debt but can t make charges the main difference between a guarantor and a co signer is that the lender must exhaust every possibility of collecting against you before they can sue a guarantor a co signer has less protection against liability and can be sued immediately with a joint applicant you can often pool your assets with another person usually a spouse partner family member or roommate to

with will likely have a notary available if it is an auto loan many car dealerships have a notary on staff request a copy of the form once you have completed the guarantor form and returned it ask the entity you signed the agreement with to send you a copy of the form as well as all pertinent documents you will need these for your records you may also need them later if the person you became a

obligations in terms of late fees and back rent 9 x research source make an agreement with the borrower as a guarantor you won t have direct control over the borrower s loan repayments it s a good idea to draft a contract between yourself and the borrower in this contract you can require the borrower to keep you apprised of their financial obligations such as notifying you if they take out another loan you may also want to get written permission to see how much money is in the borrower s accounts additionally you can list terms regarding what parts of the loan you are limited to be sure to include this information into the contract with the lender as well accept that you are financially liable before you complete a guarantor form it is important that you understand your obligations by becoming a guarantor for a loan or an apartment you are guaranteeing to meet the financial obligations of the person you are signing for if they fail to make their payments the responsibility falls on you 10 x research source because you have a better credit score the lender or landlord may sue you first because you will be more likely to pay you may also be charged for any court or attorney

between you determine if becoming a guarantor is worth the risk of destroying this relationship 11 x research source if you would not be willing to loan this person money you should not become a

guaranteeing the loan however if the other person defaults and you are stuck with their debt this may seriously damage your credit score ultimately the small benefit of becoming a guarantor is not worth the much larger hit your credit score could take 12 x research source consider an alternative to becoming a guarantor because being a guarantor can be so financially dangerous and complicated you may want to consider helping in another way although loaning money is also fraught with issues it does not carry any of the legal obligations that becoming a guarantor does if the person defaults or fails to make their payments you will only be out the money that you loaned them and not have to face the possibility of being sued or paying a much larger sum if you feel comfortable with it you might offer to let the person stay with you instead of guaranteeing their lease you might also offer to help them find a loan with a more accommodating interest rate cancel the guarantee to limit your liability if the person you are a guarantor for stops making payments for the rent or loan you ll be responsible for the money typically you can cancel the guarantee at any time while you will still have to pay back the original amount you won t be responsible for any further debt incurred by the borrower,Finance-and-Business

how to write a debt negotiation letter,if you owe a creditor more money than you can afford to pay right now writing a debt negotiation letter is the first step in attempting to pay down your debt in a way that meets your current budget constraints negotiating debt is helpful when you want to save your credit score but can only afford to pay a portion of what you owe consider the following steps to get the attention of creditors with a letter that proposes a compromise when it comes to your payments,confirm your debt obligation this includes late fees taxes interest rates and any other fees that may have been added since the original bill it should also include the terms of repayment and procedures and rights in the event of default contact the creditor before you write the letter to find out these details assess your financial situation create a budget based upon your current circumstances including income and monthly expenses this will help you know how much you can afford to pay in settlement payments to your creditor and will also allow you to prove your case that your settlement is all you can afford to pay make sure to collect documentation of this information so that you can prove your financial details if the creditor requests it a good percentage of net monthly income after tax income to allocate towards debt repayment is 20 percent this way you can save 10 percent and put the remaining 70 percentage towards living expenses this 20 percent should be used for all debt payments so if you have other debts in addition to the one you are negotiating you will have to factor in that monthly cost before determining how much you can pay on the negotiated debt each month 1 x research source for example if your monthly take home income is 3 000 you would be able to put 20 percent of that 600 towards debt repayment each month if your only other debt is your car payment at 200 per month this leaves you 400 to pay off your negotiated debt each month decide what type of settlement you want to achieve your settlement offer if accepted will reduce the total amount of debt you repay or modify your payment terms however this can be done in several ways ask for the solution that fits your situation best you can ask for a balance reduction a lower monthly payment or temporary relief from payments among other options just make sure you can afford the settlement that you ask for 2 x research source for example a temporary respite from payments may be useful if you have a temporary income reduction such as if you ve lost your job but are actively searching for a new one this way you can continue repaying your loan as you were before when your income returns on the other hand someone with more serious long term income reduction or high ongoing expenses such as a serious medical condition may be forced to ask for a balance reduction doing so allows you to reduce your payments to a manageable level indefinitely prioritize debt negotiations when considering your debts and financial situation focus on your most important debts first this depends primarily with whether or not your debts are secured with collateral or unsecured you want to focus first on those debts where default would be the most painful such as losing a home or an automobile letting payments lapse on these debts would be much more difficult for you than say your credit card debt figure out how much to offer you should offer to pay as much as you realistically can given your income and expenses however your creditor will likely expect you to repay between 40 and 60 percent of your total debt amount regardless of what you can afford start at the lower bound 40 percent or your creditor may immediately reject your settlement offer 3 x research source this also depends on the type of debt settlement you are asking for if you are asking for a balance reduction due to medical difficulties or another long term reduction in your ability to pay your lender may realize that they will have to accept what you offer or risk getting nothing in bankruptcy proceedings however asking for a payment break due to a temporary reduction in income may mean that you may be required to make higher payments once you regain your income these payments would be used to make up for the missed payments if you are asking for a monthly payment reduction keep in mind that you can ask for an increase in repayment duration so that you can eventually repay the majority of your debt while paying a lower monthly payment you can also work on negotiating a lower interest rate this would reduce the overall amount paid without changing your principal handle collections agencies differently overdue debt that has been sold to a collections agency should be handled differently than debt still owned by original lenders at this point the debt has been sold for a very small amount and the collections agency just hopes to get back more than they paid this opens them up for a very small settlement as a percentage of the original debt amount for example a collections agency might accept less than 10 percent of the original value especially for old debts know your creditor rights notify creditors to limit communications to letters rather than phone calls you do not need to be harassed during this stressful phase before paying anything make sure the debt is still legally collectible under your state s statute of limitations for debt collections collectors may seek repayment for debts that you no longer have a legal requirement to pay 4 x research source check the statute of limitations for your state and type of debt by visiting http www bankrate com finance credit cards state statutes of limitations for old debts 1 aspx and locating the relevant number of years in the chart you should consider engaging an attorney to work with creditors an attorney is evidence that you are knowledgable of your rights prepared to make collection difficult and capable of filing bankruptcy as a last resort open your letter appropriately address the letter to dear sir or madam you can also use the person s name if you know it place a header on the left side of your letter with the name of the lender their address and re followed by your account number 5 x research source include your account information restate your account number and the name that the account is under in your first sentence state the amount that the creditor claims that you owe and the monthly payment they are asking for 6 x research source describe why you are unable to make the agreed upon payments briefly describe the situation you are in that is preventing you from making your payments many borrowers have unexpected health related expenses and experience job loss for example so creditors are used to hearing these reasons however don t write a sob story to get your creditor to feel sorry for you instead keep it brief and professional explaining the situation in objective terms include a description of your financial situation using actual numbers like your monthly income living expenses and debt payments make it clear that your only other option is to file for bankruptcy but do so in a non threatening way it may help your case to attach proof of your situation to the letter for example you could include proof of unemployment or a doctor s note that specifies your serious illness 7 x research source state your proposal clearly state that your reason for writing the letter is that you owe money and request a compromise be clear about what you are requesting do you want a reduced interest rate longer repayment period or a reduction in loan amount make your offer terms clear in amount and purpose ground them in actual numbers by making your monthly repayment amount as much as you can afford given your income and expenses be sure that any offer of payment made to creditor would be realistic for you to make defaulting on an agreed upon repayment plan can limit future opportunities and your ability to work with future creditors ask the creditor to protect your credit request that the amount you propose be considered payment in full so that your credit report is not damaged when you negotiate your debt creditors can choose what they report to credit reporting agencies so asking them to not report your debt as unpaid or settled may actually work out be clear that you want the debt removed from your credit report rather than just listed as paid as agreed this will protect your credit score 8 x research source specify the form of payment that you will make such as money order or cashier s check indicate a date when the payment or payments will be received by the creditor in order for the contract to remain valid 9 x research source having cash on hand to pay the debt will likely motivate your creditor to accept your settlement 10 x research source write the letter using a professional tone do not threaten the creditor and avoid giving too much information about your personal life keep your letter to the point and short under a page avoid lying pleading or begging with your creditor for sympathy they will only respond to cold hard facts and your offer of repayment end your letter correctly close the letter out with sincerely and then your name underneath include your address and telephone number under your name 11 x research source check over your letter before sending it consider having a lawyer or credit counselor inspect the debt negotiation letter before you send it to make sure the language is professional and the point comes across clearly the letter is considered a legal document so make sure you don t make any statements that can be used against your interests in court threats lies etc send the letter and wait for a response send your letter through certified mail so that you have a record of your creditor s receipt of the letter keep copies of your letter any future letters and any responses you receive in your records they will be useful if you end up in court with your creditor in the future 12 x research source negotiate with the lender if the creditor does not agree to the sum proposed in your debt negotiation letter increase the offer until it is accepted if you cannot afford anything further stress that accepting some payment for you is in their best interest they know that if you file for bankruptcy they will typically receive no repayment so getting something from you is preferable 13 x research source if the loan is secured you may still lose the pledged assets if you file for bankruptcy there is also a probability that co signers will be called upon for payment if you end up negotiating on the phone write down everything that is said write down settlement amounts repayment details who you talked to and when you talked to them 14 x research source always receive a counteroffer before revising an offer previously made consider getting a recording device for collection negotiation calls and let callers know you are recording conversation this is especially useful when dealing with collection agencies obtain a written agreement to make the agreement legally binding you will need a written agreement from your lender make sure that the agreement clearly states the terms of the settlement and that the settlement if fully paid will result in the forgiveness of the original amount make sure that your lender creates and signs this document rather than just signing a copy of your letter and sending it back 15 x research source comply with the settlement terms pay the amount that was agreed upon by the specified date in order to uphold your part of the contract request a receipt from the creditor once you have paid the settlement agreement should be kept for seven years in the event another creditor appears with the same debt check your credit report about 3 months after you negotiate your debt to make sure that the payment appears on it it should be referred to as paid in full on your report so that your credit score is not negatively affected if it does not show up as being paid send a request to the credit bureaus to correct the report and also include a copy of your debt negotiation letter and receipt,Finance-and-Business

say deliver a closing argument after all evidence has been submitted the debt buyer will give a closing argument you go second your purpose in closing argument is to convince the jury that the debt buyer doesn t have a valid legal claim and that you do not owe the debt buyer any money await the verdict when all evidence has been presented the judge will give the jury instructions the jury then retires to deliberate if you are in small claims court then the judge will rule on the case from the bench appeal if necessary you might want to file an appeal if you lose at trial however you should

can confront the witness with the email if you are representing yourself then read question witnesses when representing yourself for tips on how to effectively cross examine a witness deliver a closing argument after all evidence has been presented your lawyer will make a closing argument the purpose of the closing argument is to tie together all of the evidence and show how it supports your case you should refer to specific pieces of evidence in your closing argument the judge might have forgotten some of the earlier testimony for example you can argue we have mountains of evidence that the defendant set out to defraud the plaintiff for example there was the loan document itself which was very confusing the explanation of repayment was buried deep in the document on page eight wait for the verdict the judge should deliver a verdict from the bench however if your case is complicated then the judge might take the issue under consideration and issue a ruling at a later date you might have to fill out the order if you win the lawsuit ask the clerk for where the order forms are write down the substance of the judge s oral ruling and show it to the defendant you then submit the order to the court for the judge s signature generally the court s judgment doesn t become final until it is signed by the judge and filed with the court clerk 26 x research source this might not happen the day the judge delivers the oral ruling file for an appeal if you lose then you might want to appeal if so you need to get a notice of appeal form from the court clerk you can fill it out

how to avoid going to court when filing for bankruptcy,in a chapter 7 bankruptcy any assets that aren t exempt are sold to pay a portion of your debts and the rest are discharged for this type of bankruptcy you typically won t have to go to court you must attend a creditors meeting which doesn t involve the court provided all issues are resolved at your creditors meeting to your trustee s satisfaction there will be no court hearing chapter 13 bankruptcy typically requires at least one hearing during which the judge will approve your plan to repay your creditors however the courts may require additional hearings if you re representing yourself so if you truly want to avoid going to court when filing for bankruptcy hire an attorney 1 x research source,wait several months before you file ideally wait at least three to four months after you decide you want to file for bankruptcy to actually file you can control your financial behavior and avoid questionable transactions that might cause problems with your bankruptcy case 2 x research source in some situations such as if you re trying to prevent an imminent wage garnishment you may not have this luxury if you re getting behind on your bills and experiencing significant financial stress speak to a financial professional or credit counselor as soon as possible they can help you decide if bankruptcy is for you this way you can plan accordingly rather than getting yourself in a situation where you can t spend several months preparing to file when you file for bankruptcy the trustee an officer of the court who oversees your bankruptcy will look back over your expenditures for several months before you filed the best way to avoid having any questionable transactions that happen a few months before you file is to make the decision to file for bankruptcy and then wait several months before you actually file leave your assets where they are any transactions in the months immediately preceding your bankruptcy filing will be highly scrutinized by the court transferring assets to a friend or family member or moving large sums of money from one account to another looks suspect 3 x research source 4 x research source for example if you re filing chapter 7 you typically can exempt one vehicle from liquidation in bankruptcy if you own two cars it may be tempting to transfer the title of that second car to the name of a friend or family member that way you could avoid losing that car when you file for bankruptcy however this defeats the purpose of bankruptcy which is to pay as many of your creditors as possible and give you a second start by discharging all of your other debts the trustee and the court will look back for many months if not years to ensure you haven t been transferring assets in anticipation of filing for bankruptcy if the trustee suspects various transfers are intended to defraud you ll wind up in court to defend or explain those transactions choose payments wisely you may want to pay off certain debts once you ve decided to file for bankruptcy but preferential transfers are a big no no while paying your regular bills is fine you may end up having to go to court to explain or defend any extraordinary payments 5 x research source 6 x research source 7 x research source if you want to avoid going to court you also must avoid paying off some debts and ignoring others while you may think you re simply doing that creditor a favor because they re been nice to you the bankruptcy court looks at this as fraud this also means you can t pay off loans made by friends or family members despite your relationship these are considered legal debts and the bankruptcy court considers preferential treatment to be fraud after you file you can choose to pay back debts such as a loan from a friend or family member even after it s been discharged if you plan to do this let the creditor know you also typically can choose to leave out secured debts such as your mortgage or car loan so that you don t lose your house or car as a result of your bankruptcy resist adding to your debt in the months leading up to a bankruptcy be extremely conservative with your spending and do everything you can to avoid racking up more debt the same concept applies to seeking credit line increases or opening new accounts 8 x research source for example suppose you re planning to file for bankruptcy next month and you get a credit card pre approval in the mail it may be tempting to treat this offer like free money if the credit card company approves you with a 10 000 limit you think you could simply max out this card and then add it to your bankruptcy not so fast if you open a new account just before you file for bankruptcy the bankruptcy court may consider this fraud the same logic applies if you get a credit line increase on an existing card and then run up the balance get your records in order if you file a sloppy petition that you have to amend several times you could find yourself in court having to answer questions about the quality of your paperwork worse significant mistakes could result in your case getting dismissed in its entirety 9 x research source when you speak with an attorney he or she typically will have a checklist of documents you must have to complete the bankruptcy petition make sure you get copies of your credit report from each of the three major bureaus and check each entry on your report carefully it s important to include every debt on your petition even if you haven t heard from the creditor in several years incomplete petitions and schedules are a sure fire way to end up in court ask for recommendations sometimes recommendations from friends or family members can be your best options when you re looking for an attorney these are people who understand you and the specifics of your case 10 x research source 11 x research source if you know anyone near you who has recently filed for bankruptcy ask them which attorney they used and whether they would recommend them ask questions about their experience to get a better idea of whether that attorney might work for you you also might want to ask any attorneys or accountants you know for recommendations even attorneys who don t practice bankruptcy may know good bankruptcy attorneys particularly if they regularly have clients who have filed for bankruptcy for example bankruptcy and divorce unfortunately often go hand in hand so a family law attorney probably knows bankruptcy attorneys they can recommend because accountants may frequently interact with bankruptcy attorneys they also may have recommendations for you or at least be able to tell you who you should stay away from browse internet directories even if you ve managed to score a good recommendation or two you still should look for possible attorneys yourself hit your state or local bar association s website to start and use their searchable directory 12 x research source 13 x research source many bar associations have a bankruptcy section which includes attorneys licensed to practice in your area who specialize in bankruptcy typically attorneys must complete additional tests and submit professional references to be able to say they specialize in a particular area of law these will be the strongest bankruptcy attorneys who practice in your area check each attorney s professional website as well as doing a general internet search for reviews from clients there are multiple websites that allow current and former clients to provide reviews and ratings of attorneys you should value client reviews more highly than any awards or best of lists as these typically are voted on by fellow attorneys who may agree to vote for each other as a professional courtesy schedule several consultations bankruptcy attorneys typically offer a free initial consultation take advantage of this to talk to at least three or four attorneys this way you can get a feel for each attorney s background and practice style and choose your best fit 14 x research source 15 x research source call the office of each attorney in whom you re interested and try to schedule the initial consultation within the next week or two if an attorney is too busy to see you within this time it may be that he or she is too busy to represent you effectively or pay enough attention to your case if you want to avoid going to court you need an attorney who has sufficient time and energy to devote to your case if you re scheduling more than one consultation on the same day make sure to leave several hours between appointments for example you might schedule one in the morning and one in the afternoon provide information in advance the attorneys you interview won t be able to provide you much direct advice on your case unless they have a good breakdown of your financial situation the more detail you re able to provide each attorney to evaluate before your initial consultation the more you ll get out of the meeting 16 x research source 17 x research source the attorney may have forms to fill out before your consultation or a checklist of documents or information you need to bring with you find out how far in advance of your consultation you need to provide this information but don t wait until the last minute send the information as soon as possible to give the attorney plenty of time to look over it if you re mailing documents to the attorney s office clearly mark each page with your name and the date and time of your initial consultation include any reference or confirmation number the attorney s office has given you ask each attorney lots of questions attorneys often have a basic script of information they provide to prospective clients during a free initial consultation but that may not include information that s important to you 18 x research source 19 x research source specifically you need to find out how much experience each attorney has handling bankruptcies similar to yours since it s important to you not to go to court ask each attorney if you will be required to attend any court hearings or what ways there are to avoid having to go to court make sure the attorneys understand that this is a priority for you you also want to find out about the attorney s practice style ask what ways are best to communicate with the attorney for example whether the attorney prefers an email or a phone call and how quickly they return messages if the attorney is part of a larger firm find out how much of the work on your case that attorney will personally do if someone else will be doing the lion s share of the work on your case ask if you can meet them too there is no right answer to any of the questions you ask particularly those that evaluate the attorney s practice style different attorneys have different styles and methods and can be equally effective the true question is how the attorney s work style will work for you compare and contrast the attorneys you interviewed after you ve completed your scheduled consultations take a look at each attorney s characteristics pit them against each other to decide which can best represent you in your bankruptcy proceeding 20 x research source 21 x research source since you re filing for bankruptcy you have limited funds and may consider an attorney s fees paramount however attorneys who handle bankruptcy cases know this and typically are willing to work with you on fees for this reason don t allow fees to be the only or even primary reason you choose one attorney over another instead concentrate on each attorney s experience and their ability to help you achieve the goals you have in filing for bankruptcy above all it s important that you feel comfortable and at ease with the attorney you choose one attorney you interviewed may have had far more experience and lower fees than the others however if he or she intimidated you or made you feel like a loser for filing for bankruptcy do not choose that attorney get a written retainer agreement when you hire an attorney make sure you get a detailed contract that outlines the terms of the representation have the attorney explain it to you and question anything you don t understand or with which you don t agree 22 x research source 23 x research source even though it may not seem this way when the attorney hands you the retainer to sign this agreement is negotiable it won t hurt you to ask for something the worst the attorney can do is say no however keep in mind that most attorneys are willing to negotiate various terms of their retainer agreement likewise if something you talked about in the initial consultation is not covered in the retainer agreement ask the attorney to include it typically the attorney will be willing to give you time to look over the retainer agreement before you sign it you may want to have a trusted friend or family member look it over as well go over your bankruptcy paperwork carefully the trustee will ask you questions about your paperwork at your creditors meeting make sure you are comfortably familiar with the contents of the documents you filed 24 x research source 25 x research source particularly if you re filing bankruptcy under chapter 7 you won t have to go to court at all if all issues are resolved to the trustee s satisfaction at the creditors meeting for this reason it s important that you know the information on the documents filed with the court in your bankruptcy case this may require a bit of study if you have an attorney since you didn t fill out the petition and schedules yourself make any amendments before your creditors meeting in going over your petition you may come across an item that has changed since you initially completed the paperwork file an amendment to set the record straight 26 x research source this also applies if you find something such as a missing account that you want to add to your petition keep in mind that if you add a creditor fewer than 14 days before your meeting you must have those new creditors served with your petition and notice of the meeting the trustee may propose or require you to amend your petition to reflect the information provided in the creditors meeting however you want your documents to be as accurate as possible before the meeting to avoid going to court organize your documents and information the impression you make is important at your creditors meeting one important way to make a good impression is to appear organized and in control having to stop and shuffle through a loose stack of papers will not endear you to the trustee 27 x research source 28 x research source you should receive a checklist of documents you re required to bring to the creditors meeting use this checklist to organize your documents your attorney also may have a checklist or other methods to help you organize your documents before the meeting consider using a binder with tabs to keep your documents together and easy to find answer the trustee s questions completely and honestly even though you re not in court you are under oath during your creditors meeting you could end up needing to go to court if you provide incomplete or inaccurate information 29 x research source 30 x research source even though this meeting is called a creditors meeting your creditors typically will not attend usually it will just be you and the attorney in a meeting room in an office building the trustee will ask you some general questions to confirm that you ve been accurate and honest in the court documents you ve filed he or she also may ask specific questions about accounts or transactions that seem suspicious stick to the facts and answer all questions as completely and honestly as you can if you don t know the answer to a question say i don t know or ask the trustee for clarification if you filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy you ll be on your way to a discharge once the trustee concludes the creditors meeting you just have to wait the 60 days provided to creditors to object to your discharge generally if no creditors object to your discharge you can complete a chapter 7 bankruptcy without having to go to court if you filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy you will have to attend at least one court hearing for the judge to approve your repayment

how to evaluate offshore asset protection,offshore asset protection helps protect you from potential creditors who might sue you in particular you can transfer assets to a trust or a limited liability company llc located offshore in the typical lawsuit a person who sues you wins a judgment for a certain amount of money they can then force you to turn over assets you own in the country to satisfy the court judgment however with offshore asset protection your assets are not in the country and many are no longer in your name furthermore u s court judgments are not recognized in many countries which means that a court in the foreign country will not seize your assets for the benefit of the person who sued you,identify safe assets safe assets are those that do not expose you to potential legal liability for example you are unlikely to be sued because you own cash bonds or shares in mutual funds 1 x research source these are all safe assets check what dangerous assets you won dangerous assets are those that could subject you to legal liability they include real estate and automobiles 2 x research source someone could get injured on your real estate and you could injure someone with your car consider whether you have sufficient assets offshore asset protection isn t cheap in particular you could pay considerable fees managing your assets in the offshore accounts and trusts for this reason you should weigh how much money you have 3 x research source for example a foreign trust generally costs 20 000 to create accounting fees and administration typically costs an additional 7 000 a year 4 x research source identify potential creditors not all creditors are the same for example if you injure someone in a car accident then that person is a private plaintiff in a lawsuit assets held in an offshore account are typically shielded from private plaintiffs offshore trusts offer less protection against a government authority such as the irs or a state taxing authority 5 x research source using offshore protection vehicles probably won t shield your money from these government authorities set up an offshore bank account one protection vehicle is an offshore bank account you can park cash in these accounts and put them out of the reach of creditors from your home country often you can open up an offshore banking account in the name of a private offshore company 6 x research source bank accounts have minimum deposit amounts depending on the country they can range from 450 to 250 000 7 x research source for example opening a bank account in switzerland requires a higher minimum deposit you can work with your attorney to identify the best places to open a bank account often you can have the bank account in a different country from where you have other asset protection vehicles create an offshore corporation or llc with an offshore company you title all of your property to the company because you own the corporation or the llc you still control the assets however because the assets are no longer in your name it is harder for creditors to find them 8 x research source an llc also offers additional protection as the name implies an llc limits the liability of its owners if the llc is sued then the individual owners cannot be liable for the injuries caused by the llc fund an offshore trust in a trust you transfer title to assets to the trust you are called the settlor and the person who manages the trust is the trustee the trustee manages the trust property for the benefit of beneficiaries you can create a trust so that you are both the settlor and a beneficiary 9 x research source a well drafted offshore trust will contain a duress provision this provision states that the trustee will ignore any request by the beneficiary to remove assets from the trust when the beneficiary is compelled by a court order this means that during a period of legal duress the trustee can remove the manager i e the person being sued and protect the assets when the legal duress is over they can reappoint the manager add a transfer clause a transfer clause in a trust gives the trustee the power to move the trust to a different country in certain situations for example you might have a trust in the cook islands if someone files a lawsuit in the cook islands then your trustee could move the trust to a different country the creditor would then have to file a new lawsuit in the new country 10 x research source transfer clauses make it very difficult for creditors to win lawsuits against you in the country where the trust is located before the lawsuit can get too far the trust has been moved avoid delay using offshore trusts is legal so long as you create them before you become liable to a potential creditor 11 x research source you cannot create trusts or other asset protection vehicles to defraud someone or commit a crime for example imagine that you are a doctor you want to put your assets in an offshore trust and an offshore bank account after moving the property offshore you commit malpractice and injure a patient your assets are protected if the patient wins a lawsuit against you now imagine that you injure a patient first and then quickly try to move assets out of the country to protect them in this situation offshore asset protection probably will not protect you 12 x research source find a lawyer with asset protection experience you should get referrals to an attorney especially one with experience in the fraudulent transfer act as well as the creation of offshore asset protection vehicles 13 x research source if you know someone who is using offshore asset protection you can ask him or her for a referral to their attorney however you might not have any leads in this situation you can get a referral to a business attorney be sure to call and ask if they have experience with offshore asset protection analyze which country to move assets to there are a few countries which are quite popular for offshore asset protection cook islands belize nevis and cayman islands each has different laws which are friendly to debtors speak to a local attorney in each possible location to discuss which country has the friendliest laws for example in nevis a person has to hire a local attorney and pay up to 100 000 to start a lawsuit 14 x research source these hurdles can scare off many people from suing you in the cook islands and belize a person who sues you must prove their case for fraud beyond a reasonable doubt which is much higher than the standard in the united states discuss domestic asset protection many u s states are trying to compete with foreign countries for the asset protection market they have adopted rules that make domestic asset protection much more attractive 15 x research source these are self settled trusts meaning once you deposit the cash you can immediately access it then after a certain period of time your creditors supposedly can t access these funds 16 x research source you should talk with your lawyer about whether you can accomplish your asset protection goals using domestic asset protection trusts also compare costs with offshore asset protection trusts for example a domestic trust is generally cheaper you can set up a domestic trust for 10 000 and pay roughly 5 000 a year in fees for accounting and trust administration 17 x research source understand the risks of using offshore protection offshore protection is not risk free for example a judge could still hold you in contempt of court for not turning over assets you own according to some media reports judges are doing this more often 18 x research source with contempt a judge can put you in jail for refusing to obey the court s orders for this reason having assets in a trust might not offer 100 protection talk about the danger of contempt with your lawyer generally a judge will order contempt if they find you made the transfer fraudulently after injuring someone or accruing a debt distribute your assets properly part of a comprehensive asset protection plan involves making sure that assets are not grouped together in the same trust or llc for example if you have cash and real estate in the same trust then someone suing you for an injury sustained on the real estate could get access to both the cash and your real estate 19 x research source you can protect yourself by separating dangerous assets from safe assets for example you should put cash and bonds into a bank account but transfer dangerous assets like automobiles into a trust or an llc you should also separate dangerous assets from each other for example you could transfer them to individual llcs talk to your accountant generally offshore asset protection does not offer tax advantages you still must disclose your income from the trust to the irs though you don t have to pay taxes to the foreign country where the trust has been set up 20 x research source to fully understand the tax consequences you want to involve your accountant or another tax professional make sure that your accountant has experience in this area of the law not every accountant understands how tax rules apply to offshore assets,Finance-and-Business

is the state law that sets a time limit on a creditor s collection efforts if a debt is too old the creditor will not be able to take legal action to collect it if you are nearing a time limit for collection that creditor may be more willing to accept a low settlement 7 x trustworthy source us consumer financial protection bureau u s government agency for protecting consumers in the financial sector go to source the statute of limitations on collection actions generally ranges from three to six years a handy list of time limits is available at http www bankrate com finance credit cards state statutes of limitations for old debts 1 aspx you may wish to consult with an attorney because identifying when a statute of limitations begins and when it expires can be complicated decide if bankruptcy is an option in some cases filing for bankruptcy may be the best choice to deal with your debts and give you a fresh start you can file for chapter 7 or chapter 13 bankruptcy keep in mind that filing for bankruptcy does not discharge all types of debt these are called priority debt and include things like alimony and recent income tax and it will destroy your credit so you should look at all your options before considering bankruptcy 8 x research source not just everyone qualifies for bankruptcy there are certain eligibility requirements to file for chapter 7 you must pass the means test to see if your income is low enough to make you eligible and to file for chapter 13 your debts must not exceed certain limits you will also need to consider things like how much property you own if any if you are facing a lawsuit from your creditors and what you hope to achieve by filing contact the appropriate office if you have received a monthly statement or a demand letter that correspondence probably contains a telephone number for you to contact about the outstanding debt for a credit card you can call the customer service number that is generally printed on your card for a mortgage or car loan you will want to call the lending office whichever number or office you call make it clear right away that you are calling in an effort to negotiate a settlement of the debt you may need to be transferred to a special collections or negotiations office 9 x research source introduce the possibility of bankruptcy even if you are trying to avoid bankruptcy you should mention it in the conversation creditors realize that if you file bankruptcy they will likely receive nothing or very little from the amount that you owe a settlement now is in their best interest instead of a bankruptcy filing later 10 x research source be professional not emotional keep the conversation on a factual professional level even though your financial troubles may be very personal for you settling a debt is a business deal you need to have your financial notes in front of you and have a plan for the conversation if the creditor becomes threatening or demanding try to steer the conversation back to the facts focus on your ability to pay and your effort to avoid bankruptcy if the creditor becomes demanding or if you find yourself becoming emotional or defensive you may just need to end the conversation and call back another time 11 x research source if you find yourself losing control of the conversation or losing control of your emotions just say i m sorry but i need to go now i will call you back to continue this conversation soon confirm the balance due ask some questions to confirm that your information is correct you need to know how much you owe on the particular account before you can make a settlement offer if the creditor reports to you that the balance is much different than you thought it was you need to ask questions to find out why this is so ask for dates of recent charges penalties or interest find out if there are any parts of it that are incorrect which may help you reduce the balance without a settlement 12 x research source make an introductory offer if you have already worked out what you can afford to pay you should now be ready to make an offer start low because the creditor will likely try to get you to pay more leave yourself some room to negotiate for example if you have a balance due of 4 000 and you think you can ultimately afford to pay about half make an opening offer of 1 000 for some debts collecting 25 may be satisfactory if not you have room to negotiate up to your figure of 2 000 keep comprehensive notes of all negotiating conversations most of your negotiations will probably be by telephone you should keep notes of the time and date of your call the person you speak with and the stages of your negotiations you will need these notes in case you have to call back again or to write a final settlement agreement 13 x research source for example a good page of notes for a settlement conversation may look something like this 7 28 16 called 1 800 555 1234 spoke with john smith in collections i offered 1 000 he asked for 3 500 i offered 1 500 he agreed payment in full by august 15 understand the full terms of the final agreement before you end the conversation make sure that you have an agreement and make sure that you know what it is check your notes and read them back if necessary to be sure you have the deal correctly you need to know when any amount must be paid if your settlement is to set up a new payment plan make sure you know which day of the month the payments are due how much each payment is to be and how many payments you are making 14 x research source you should wrap up your discussions by saying i d like to verify my understanding of our agreement i will pay bankcard 1 000 by the first of next month and then 1 000 a month for the next three months and that will settle the full debt is that right confirm every settlement in writing after you reach an agreement with a creditor you must get confirmation in writing the creditor may send you a new notice that includes the agreement it is better if you write the agreement yourself this does not need to be any special form you can write a simple letter that refers to your conversation and contains the terms of your agreement for example a simple settlement agreement letter would look like this dear ____ i am writing to confirm our telephone conversation from july 28 2016 i offered to pay and you offered to accept a single payment of 1 000 in full satisfaction of my debt on credit card number 5555 1234 5678 as we agreed i will pay this amount by august 15 2016 if i have misstated any part of our agreement please contact me right away please sign and return a copy of this letter to me right away it is important to include the phrase in full satisfaction of my debt this is the phrase that will prevent the creditor from continuing any collection efforts for the remainder of your debt verify the settlement on your credit report a few weeks after you have settled any particular debt you need to check your credit report to ensure that the debt has properly been reported as settled some creditors may neglect to report the settlement this leaves the appearance that you still owe the debt if you find that a settlement has not been reported you should contact the creditor directly and ask them to report the settlement right away you can also contact the credit reporting company and dispute the particular item on your report the reporting company will investigate and try to resolve the matter as well 15 x research source to dispute an item on your credit report you need to send the reporting company a letter along with copies of your settlement agreement and proof of payments take care of tax obligations if by settling a debt you succeed in getting any one debt reduced by 600 or more you will have to pay income tax on the forgiven amount the irs treats forgiven or settled debt the same as income reporting forgiven debt is a simple process 16 x research source you can learn more about reporting settlements on your taxes at report canceled debt taxable income as an example suppose you owed 4 000 on a credit card and you managed to negotiate a settlement so that you only have to pay 1 000 the forgiven balance of 3 000 is considered to be income and you will have to pay taxes on it if you are in a 25 tax bracket for example this settlement will cost you 3 000 x 25 750 in taxes this is still a big discount over the original 4 000 debt but you will need to consider the tax obligation when you are settling 17 x research source consult with an attorney you can try to settle your debts on your own but many people find that working with an attorney is beneficial if you have started to receive collection demands either by telephone or letter you should meet with an attorney an attorney can help you respond appropriately to collection demands the attorney can also explain the possibilities that are open to you including settlement consolidation or even bankruptcy if necessary 18 x research source in addition if the negotiations do not succeed and a creditor decides to sue you an attorney can also help you handle the lawsuit and can defend you in court try contacting the bar association in your area to ask for a referral to a legal aid society or other source for free or reduced fee legal service meet with a credit counselor a financial adviser or credit counselor can meet with you often for free or at a low cost to help you review your debts meeting with a credit counselor is a requirement for any one who is considering filing bankruptcy in many cases the counseling services can help people avoid bankruptcy credit counseling can help you set a budget organize your debts and make a plan to pay off your debts if you decide that you still need to settle some debts a credit counselor can help you decide how much you can afford to pay 19 x research source avoid commercial debt settlement companies if you run a simple search online for debt settlement you will quickly find a long list of companies offering to help you get out of debt be cautious about any companies that make bold promises you will usually get better advice from an attorney or accountant than from a so called debt settlement company watch out for these warning signs 20 x trustworthy source us consumer financial protection bureau u s government agency for protecting consumers in the financial sector go to source debt settlement companies often charge high fees be skeptical of a company that encourages you to stop paying your debts many companies will tell you to stop paying as a first step toward settling your debts stopping payment will only add penalties late fees and interest to the amounts that you owe many creditors will not negotiate with commercial settlement companies as a result the company you choose may not be able to help you at all with some of your debts the tactics of some debt settlement companies can actually hurt your credit score,Finance-and-Business

how to subordinate claims during automatic stay as a creditor,during bankruptcy proceedings creditors are usually subjected to an automatic stay that prevents them from conducting collection activities while the debtor is getting their property in order however an automatic stay may not prevent creditors from positioning themselves one way you as a creditor can position yourself for collection is to subordinate creditor claims when a creditor claim is subordinated that debt is paid later than debts that have a more senior right most claims are subordinated between creditors

of specific creditors this ranking becomes incredibly important during bankruptcy proceeding because debts with a higher rank get paid off first 1 x research source under the bankruptcy code a subordination agreement is fully enforceable so long as it is unambiguous and properly executed 2 x research source however because you will be or are in an automatic stay the court may interpret the execution of a subordination agreement as a violation of that stay make sure your lawyer feels confident in the agreement s enforceability before you draft and execute it discuss your options with other creditors if you and your lawyer feel confident that a subordination agreement will be enforceable you and other creditors must discuss how you want the agreement set up most creditors will want their claims to have the highest priority possible this will allow their claims to be paid out first by the debtor therefore you will need to find a valid reason to request that your claim jump other claims that are currently ahead of you common reasons for subordinating a claim include the refinancing of a loan and creditor wrongdoing when a creditor offers a loan on property that has already had one or more loans associated with it the newest creditor will often require as a prerequisite to making the loan the more senior creditors to subordinate their claims this helps the newest creditor feel at ease about making the loan because they know if something happens their money will be paid back first the most common example of this is with mortgages 3 x research source sometimes a creditor

detail the subordination the first substantive paragraph of your subordination agreement needs to lay out exactly what interests are being subordinated and what interests are gaining priority the security interests need to be defined with enough detail so a court can identify what you are talking about for example do not say junior creditor subordinates the mortgage a court will not be able to identify what mortgage you are talking about or how it will be subordinated instead consider saying something like junior creditor hereby subordinates any and all security interests of the junior creditor in any of the debtor s personal property and assets the specific assets at question are outlined in exhibit a in favor of such loan and any other indebtedness present or future of debtor to

collect a certain dollar amount as consideration for entering into the agreement for example one option might be to draft your provision as follows it is agreed that until senior creditor has been paid in full by debtor no payments in cash or other property shall be made by debtor or received by junior creditor another option may be the following it is agreed that until senior creditor has been

implement any enforcement actions to try and collect their debt before you this usually means the junior creditor will need to agree not to ask the debtor for payment enforce any right they have to collect the money or join any legal action to ask for the money for example this provision might read as follows the junior creditor will not i make any demand for payment of or take any action to accelerate any junior indebtedness ii seek to collect payment of or enforce any right or remedies against the borrower related to or supporting any of the junior indebtedness iii commence or join with

appears at the top right hand corner of the check if the check does not have a check number the check is fake if it does have a check number check the number against the number in the magnetic ink character recognition micr line the micr line is the line of numbers at the bottom of a check printed by the issuing bank that gives all the relevant numbers for a check from left to right the long string of numbers contains the routing number the account number and the check number the check number should match the numbers on the far right of the line if it doesn t match the check is likely a fake if the check number is low from 101 400 on a personal check or 1000 1500 in a business check the check may be fake this signals a new account and 90 percent of fake checks are written from new accounts 4 x research source 5 x research source 6 x research source examine the micr line the micr line appears at the bottom of every check issued by a real bank rub your finger over the line to check the feel of the ink also look at the ink s quality the special ink used for the micr line is dull and should print smoothly if it is raised or shiny the check is fake you also need to examine the routing number in the micr line this will be the first series of numbers in the micr line go to the federal reserve bank services website and search the routing number of the institution issuing the check if it exists check the information of the bank against the name and address given to you by the federal reserve if it doesn t match you likely have a fake check 7 x research source 8 x research source feel the paper real checks are typically printed on thick sturdy stock paper rub your fingers along the check notice the thickness of the check bend the check back and forth noticing the resistance the check gives if the check is thin and flimsy it is likely a fake check fake checks are also typically printed on shiny paper if the check is not printed on matte paper it might be fake you can also try an ink test dampen your finger and run it across an inked area of the check if the color smears it was printed on a color printer and is fake 9 x research source 10 x research source notice the signature most signed checks have a consistent signature look for gaps in the signature a digital appearance or shaky and erratic pen strokes these are signs that may indicate the signature was forged or scanned from another source and printed this doesn t always mean it is a fake check but you should look for other clues if the signature seems forced 11 x research source 12 x

legitimate company or sweepstakes will never ask you to send money to them taxes on such winnings should always be paid directly to the government also never send money through wire transfer under these circumstances this is the same as sending someone cash once the scammer picks it up from the wire service there is no way to get your money back once you realize it is a scam double check companies many check scams use legitimate businesses as a cover for their corrupt ventures if you recognize a real company attached to a check you receive and the check looks real contact the company don t use any of the information that was sent with the check these details could have been created by the person scamming you look for information about the company from an independent source to verify if the check you received is real research the company on the web or look up its number in a phone directory most businesses will let you know if they sent you a check or if they are participating in a sweepstakes do not spend the funds before the check is verified a fake check isn t always spotted by a bank you may be able to cash a check even if it is fake a bank may not know a check is fake until the bank tries to clear the check this process can take weeks if you cash the check or deposit the check and then spend the funds you will be responsible for paying the money back to the bank it does not matter that the check is a scam or that you were unaware of it being fake do your due diligence to ensure the check is legitimate then wait until the check is cleared by the bank before spending the money the bank holds you responsible for determining the legitimacy of a check before you try to cash it if you fail to comply with the bank s request to return the money your accounts can be frozen the bank can also take legal action and sue you for the money you can also be charged with fraud even if you were unaware of the circumstances avoid working at home scams some check scams seem like job offers if you are contacted to be a mystery shopper or an account manager at home this is likely a scam most legitimate companies that hire mystery shoppers will never send you checks or money orders ahead of time the scammers will likely tell you that all you need to do is deposit the checks or money orders they send you you take your pay as cash from the checks when you deposit them never deposit checks for someone you don t know or try to make money fast by working at home for an unknown business mystery shopping is a legitimate business but it is not a get rich

long as the person who wrote the check initials the change many banks are suspicious of this it s better to have the person write you another check a valid check has a line at the bottom with the routing number and account number if that line isn t present the bank will not be able to process the check determine who must endorse the check if only your name is listed on the payee line of the check your signature is all that is needed to cash or deposit the check if someone s else name is also listed they only have to sign the check if the word and or the symbol appears between the 2 names 3 x research source the default rule is that a check with 2 or more names can be cashed or deposited individually by any of the people listed on the check if the check says or or includes ambiguous language or symbols such as a dash or a slash either of the people named can cash or deposit the check if the check is written to you meaning care of someone else only your signature is needed they generally cannot cash or deposit the check without your signature however if you have a joint bank account they may be able to deposit the check in that account on your behalf without your signature find the gray lines on the back of the check if you flip over the check you ll see 3 to 5 gray lines these typically appear on the upper short side of the check you ll also see a solid line with

discount or grocery stores you can also go to the bank that issued the check that bank will have its name and logo printed on the front of the check write for deposit only on the top endorsement line

bank for deposit or if you re giving it to someone else to deposit on your behalf include your bank account number some banks require you to include the account number where you want the check s funds deposited even if it s not required it might be a good idea if you have more than one bank account at the same bank 8 x research source for example if you have a checking account and a savings account you would typically want to include the account number for the account you want to use while you ll also include this information on the deposit slip it helps to also put it on the check in case the two get separated additionally checks deposited using an atm or a mobile app may not have deposit slips because it s a security risk if you re traveling to the bank to deposit the check in person wait until you get there to write your account number on the check sign the check below your restrictions once you ve included the deposit restriction sign the check as you normally would using a pen with blue or black ink signing below the restrictions gives them effect if you sign above the restrictions they aren t considered valid 9 x research source you can place your account number below your name

how to calculate the check digit of a routing number from an illegible check,the routing number on a check uniquely identifies the financial institution and the location where the check was printed financial institutions use routing numbers to instantaneously process financial transactions the last or ninth digit of the routing number is important because it is used to verify the authenticity of the routing number if this number becomes damaged or illegible you can use an algorithm to calculate it,understand what a routing number is the routing number is located in the bottom left hand corner of a check it is a nine digit number that uniquely identifies you bank and the location where your check was printed 1 x research source the first four digits are the federal reserve routing symbol this identifies where your check was printed there are 12 federal reserve districts and different cities in each district the next four digits are assigned by the american bankers association aba it identifies the financial institution where you opened your account the ninth digit is the check digit it is calculated using an algorithm the check digit is used to validate the 8 digit bank routing number you can verify the authenticity of a check digit by running the algorithm yourself and comparing the check digit you calculate with the one that is printed on the check understand the checksum algorithm this is the algorithm that is used to validate the authenticity of the routing number it is a series of multiplication and addition operations performed on the digits in the routing number with a valid routing number the sum of the algorithm should be evenly divisible by 10 2 x research source it is also known as the modules 10 straight summation method 3 x research source write down the nine digits of the routing number without any non numeric characters such as dashes or spaces multiply the first digit by 3 the second digit by 7 and the third digit by 1 then multiply the fourth digit by 3 the fifth digit by 7 and the sixth digit by 1 then multiply the seventh digit by 3 the eighth digit by 7 and the ninth digit by 1 add up all of the products and your answer should be evenly divisible by 10 with no remainders for example using the routing number 789456124 do the following calculation 7 x 3 8 x 7 9 x 1 4 x 3 5 x 7 6 x 1 1 x 3 2 x 7 4 x 1 this equals 21 56 9 12 35 6 3 14 4 160 the answer is evenly divisible by 10 so the routing number is valid use the checksum algorithm to find a missing check digit if the check digit is missing or illegible you can use the first eight digits to calculate the ninth digit knowing that the final result must be evenly divided by 10 allows you to back track and figure out the missing or illegible digit 4 x research source for example suppose you only had these first eight digits for the routing number 02100002 use the checksum algorithm on the first eight digits 0 x 3 2 x 7 1 x 1 0 x 3 0 x 7 0 x 1 0 x 3 2 x 7 29 find the next highest number that is divisible by 10 in this case the next highest number divisible by 10 after 29 is 30 subtract 29 from 30 to get the check digit 30 29 1 the check digit is 1 if the you do the algorithm with the first eight digits and you get a number that is already divisible by 10 then you know that the check digit must be 0 learn the history of check routing numbers prior to 1910 banks had no uniform system for identifying checks written from different banks in 1911 the american bankers association aba published a book listing all of the nation s financial institutions and assigned identifying numbers to each of them they established the routing number administration board govern the use and retirement of routing numbers 5 x research source the two forms of routing numbers still in use today are the fractional form and the magnetic ink character recognition micr form the micr form is used for automated processing of checks the numbers and symbols are printed with special shapes that can be read by automated reading equipment this font is used on all u s and canadian checks deposit slips and e commerce drafts 6 x research source the fractional form is outdated and was used when checks were hand sorted it still appears on checks along with the micr form and it can be used if the micr number is illegible you can find it in the upper right hand corner of the check the micr form routing number is printed in the lower left hand corner of the check in a 5 8 inch band understand the federal reserve routing symbol the first four digits identify the location where the check was printed the first two digits refer to one of the 12 federal reserve districts the third digit identifies a specific office of the federal reserve bank within the district the fourth digit refers to geographic areas within a territory 7 x research source understand the aba institution identifier each financial institution receives a unique four digit identifying number from the aba this makes up the second four digits of the routing number the aba institution identifier may be anywhere from one to four digits because it must take up four digits in the routing number a number with less than four digits will have zeroes before it on the check 8 x research source understand the check digit the check digit verifies the accuracy of the routing number it helps to maintain the integrity of electronic and telecommunications transactions it can be calculated with the algorithm or programmers can use a code to validate the routing number understand the fractional form of the routing number this appears in the upper right hand corner of the check it is a multi digit fraction that has a hyphenated numerator and a three or four digit denominator it includes the federal reserve routing symbol and the aba institution identifier 9 x research source understand why banks need to read routing numbers on checks when processing your check financial institutions need a reliable way of identifying your bank it is important that they do not confuse it with other banks 10 x research source sometimes banks have similar names so relying on the name of a financial institution alone could result in confusion some banks may have more than one routing number depending on its location or the type of check being used but no two banks will ever have identical routing numbers banks use routing numbers to automate several common financial transactions routine tasks such as direct deposit and automatic bill transfers rely on accurate routing numbers the routing number is also used to facilitate money transfers such as cashing checks or wiring money 11 x research source since the numbering system and micr form are consistently used across all financial institutions these automated tasks can be processed with hardly any delay find your routing number the routing number is printed on the bottom left hand corner of your check also some banks may publish their routing numbers online this is helpful for customers who need the routing numbers for wire transfers or other transactions 12 x research source having your bank s routing number so easily available is not a security risk it only becomes a security risk if someone has your routing number and your account number,Finance-and-Business

need to do this 3 business days before the payment is due this allows time for the cancellation to be processed a computer in responsible for taking care of this process this means that the information needs to be complete and correct there will not be a person there to figure out the missing information 8 x research source determine the timeline it is important to ask your bank when the

of lined paper will do find out your current balance log on to your account online call or visit your bank or visit an atm and get the current balance on the account you wish to track 2 x research source write this balance in the box at the top of the page or on the empty first line with the note balance forward there may be checks or electronic debits that haven t cleared yet so today s figure while correct will not account for debits that have not been processed yet if you re not sure of your exact current balance keep an eye on your account and check the balance in the next several days record all your transactions write down any debit money being taken out or credit money being added to your account there should be two columns in your checkbook one for debits and one for credits place the dollar amount being taken away in the debits column and the dollar amount being added in the credit column 3 x research source record all checks that you write write down the check number the date the payee who you write the check to and the amount of the check record any withdrawals or payments you make from that account if you withdraw money from the bank or atm or if you purchase something at the store or online using an atm or debit card write down the amount of the purchase if there is a fee for using the atm write down that amount also record any online bill payments if your online bill payment service gives you a confirmation code you may wish to jot this code in your check register next to the payee information record any deposits into your account if the transaction changes the amount of money in your account always write it down label your transactions doing this will help you can remember what each transaction was for when it is time to balance your checkbook use specific categories like food utilities mortgage dining out etc adjust your records daily if you share an account with someone else try to touch base with them often about any transactions done using the account so you can each record the payments and the current balance of the account in your individual checkbooks if you are balancing multiple accounts keep a separate register for each account so they are easy to track recalculate the balance in the account regularly you can do this after a transaction or less frequently such as when you sit down to do your bills if you have a history of bounced checks or an overdrawn account you should recalculate your balance after every transaction or every other transaction subtract the amount of any expense payment check or withdrawal from the total include transfers out of the account in this subtraction add the amount of any deposit credit or transfer into the account to the total subtract all your debits from your credits you should end up with a positive number write the new balance after each transaction in the rightmost column reconcile your checkbook when your bank statement arrives compare your check register to your statement and check off which transactions have cleared 4 x research source add any interest that the bank has paid you subtract any fees that the bank has charged you check that the transactions in your account register match what is on your statement make sure your recorded balance matches what the bank thinks you have not including any transactions that haven t yet cleared and aren t listed on the statement correct any mistakes in your checkbook if you find any discrepancies between your numbers and your bank s numbers figure out where they came from and correct them double check your math make sure you added and subtracted everything correctly since the checkbook last balanced correctly look for missing transactions did you forget to write something down has something not cleared or have you recorded something that happened after the statement date subtract the balance in your check register from the balance on the statement does the amount match the amount of one of the transactions if so that transaction has probably not been accounted for correctly yet if the difference between the balance in your checkbook and the balance on your statement has an even number of pennies divide the difference by 2 does this new amount match the amount of one of the transactions if so that transaction was probably added instead of subtracted or vice versa determine if all your checks have cleared the money taken out for checks and other payments may not be taken out immediately if you think a check or other payment has not yet cleared subtract the amount of that check from the bank s balance and see if it matches yours one way to stay on top of this is to check your account regularly and put check marks next to every check that has already cleared notify your bank if you think there are fraudulent charges on your account call or visit your bank to discuss any suspicious charges or charges that are not accounted for in your checkbook and you do not remember making and discuss possible refund options always make sure you report any suspected fraud on your account even if it may end up being a charge you simply forgot about or threw away the receipt for

no cents to be paid for example 47 even dollars in this case you still need to indicate that there are zero cents to be paid you do this by continuing to include the decimal point but following it with two zeros 47 00 fill in the textual amount 1 x research source underneath the pay to the order of line you will see a second line that has the currency written out at the end of it in america for example this blank line ends with the word dollars on this line you will write out the amount to be paid in words rather than numbers the dollar amount is always written out as words and the cent amount written as a fraction out of 100 this is because there are 100 cents in a dollar so if the check amount includes 45 cents it is 45 100 of a dollar while this is the basic rule there are a few different ways to format the actual content of the line written dollar amount and fractional cent amount forty seven and 50 100 written dollar amount dollars and fractional cent amount forty seven dollars and 50 100 some people choose to draw a straight horizontal line after the fractional cent amount to fill out the line forty seven dollars and 50 100 this prevents other people from adding to or changing the amount you write hyphenate compound numbers 2 x research source compound numbers do not fall evenly on decades ten twenty thirty centuries one hundred two hundred etc and so on one million two billion etc if you have a compound number like 47 as opposed to 40 you should always place a hyphen between the two parts of the word when writing it out correct forty seven incorrect forty seven or fortyseven write out the textual amount even if it is very large an amount for several hundred thousand or even million dollars should still be written out in words on the appropriate line this might mean you have to write with very small script so make sure you have enough room correct two million five hundred fifty two thousand eight hundred forty seven dollars and 00 100

note that using the wrong format can make a big difference january to november be sure to use a format appropriate for the country in which you are banking post date the check if necessary for different reasons you may not want the check to be cashed immediately for example you might need to write a check to a friend today for an amount larger than your available funds in that case you can post date the check meaning you enter a date in the future so that the check cannot be cashed until that date this can be helpful if you need to wait until payday before a check amount can be

line the memo line is optional and can be left blank sign the check the signature line is directly across from the memo line at the bottom right hand corner of the check it s very important that you provide your signature exactly as it looks on the signature card you provided the bank when you first opened your account if you ve changed your signature significantly since opening the account you

how to calculate the check digit of a routing number from an illegible check,the routing number on a check uniquely identifies the financial institution and the location where the check was printed financial institutions use routing numbers to instantaneously process financial transactions the last or ninth digit of the routing number is important because it is used to verify the authenticity of the routing number if this number becomes damaged or illegible you can use an algorithm to calculate it,understand what a routing number is the routing number is located in the bottom left hand corner of a check it is a nine digit number that uniquely identifies you bank and the location where your check was printed 1 x research source the first four digits are the federal reserve routing symbol this identifies where your check was printed there are 12 federal reserve districts and different cities in each district the next four digits are assigned by the american bankers association aba it identifies the financial institution where you opened your account the ninth digit is the check digit it is calculated using an algorithm the check digit is used to validate the 8 digit bank routing number you can verify the authenticity of a check digit by running the algorithm yourself and comparing the check digit you calculate with the one that is printed on the check understand the checksum algorithm this is the algorithm that is used to validate the authenticity of the routing number it is a series of multiplication and addition operations performed on the digits in the routing number with a valid routing number the sum of the algorithm should be evenly divisible by 10 2 x research source it is also known as the modules 10 straight summation method 3 x research source write down the nine digits of the routing number without any non numeric characters such as dashes or spaces multiply the first digit by 3 the second digit by 7 and the third digit by 1 then multiply the fourth digit by 3 the fifth digit by 7 and the sixth digit by 1 then multiply the seventh digit by 3 the eighth digit by 7 and the ninth digit by 1 add up all of the products and your answer should be evenly divisible by 10 with no remainders for example using the routing number 789456124 do the following calculation 7 x 3 8 x 7 9 x 1 4 x 3 5 x 7 6 x 1 1 x 3 2 x 7 4 x 1 this equals 21 56 9 12 35 6 3 14 4 160 the answer is evenly divisible by 10 so the routing number is valid use the checksum algorithm to find a missing check digit if the check digit is missing or illegible you can use the first eight digits to calculate the ninth digit knowing that the final result must be evenly divided by 10 allows you to back track and figure out the missing or illegible digit 4 x research source for example suppose you only had these first eight digits for the routing number 02100002 use the checksum algorithm on the first eight digits 0 x 3 2 x 7 1 x 1 0 x 3 0 x 7 0 x 1 0 x 3 2 x 7 29 find the next highest number that is divisible by 10 in this case the next highest number divisible by 10 after 29 is 30 subtract 29 from 30 to get the check digit 30 29 1 the check digit is 1 if the you do the algorithm with the first eight digits and you get a number that is already divisible by 10 then you know that the check digit must be 0 learn the history of check routing numbers prior to 1910 banks had no uniform system for identifying checks written from different banks in 1911 the american bankers association aba published a book listing all of the nation s financial institutions and assigned identifying numbers to each of them they established the routing number administration board govern the use and retirement of routing numbers 5 x research source the two forms of routing numbers still in use today are the fractional form and the magnetic ink character recognition micr form the micr form is used for automated processing of checks the numbers and symbols are printed with special shapes that can be read by automated reading equipment this font is used on all u s and canadian checks deposit slips and e commerce drafts 6 x research source the fractional form is outdated and was used when checks were hand sorted it still appears on checks along with the micr form and it can be used if the micr number is illegible you can find it in the upper right hand corner of the check the micr form routing number is printed in the lower left hand corner of the check in a 5 8 inch band understand the federal reserve routing symbol the first four digits identify the location where the check was printed the first two digits refer to one of the 12 federal reserve districts the third digit identifies a specific office of the federal reserve bank within the district the fourth digit refers to geographic areas within a territory 7 x research source understand the aba institution identifier each financial institution receives a unique four digit identifying number from the aba this makes up the second four digits of the routing number the aba institution identifier may be anywhere from one to four digits because it must take up four digits in the routing number a number with less than four digits will have zeroes before it on the check 8 x research source understand the check digit the check digit verifies the accuracy of the routing number it helps to maintain the integrity of electronic and telecommunications transactions it can be calculated with the algorithm or programmers can use a code to validate the routing number understand the fractional form of the routing number this appears in the upper right hand corner of the check it is a multi digit fraction that has a hyphenated numerator and a three or four digit denominator it includes the federal reserve routing symbol and the aba institution identifier 9 x research source understand why banks need to read routing numbers on checks when processing your check financial institutions need a reliable way of identifying your bank it is important that they do not confuse it with other banks 10 x research source sometimes banks have similar names so relying on the name of a financial institution alone could result in confusion some banks may have more than one routing number depending on its location or the type of check being used but no two banks will ever have identical routing numbers banks use routing numbers to automate several common financial transactions routine tasks such as direct deposit and automatic bill transfers rely on accurate routing numbers the routing number is also used to facilitate money transfers such as cashing checks or wiring money 11 x research source since the numbering system and micr form are consistently used across all financial institutions these automated tasks can be processed with hardly any delay find your routing number the routing number is printed on the bottom left hand corner of your check also some banks may publish their routing numbers online this is helpful for customers who need the routing numbers for wire transfers or other transactions 12 x research source having your bank s routing number so easily available is not a security risk it only becomes a security risk if someone has your routing number and your account number,Finance-and-Business

making and discuss possible refund options always make sure you report any suspected fraud on your account even if it may end up being a charge you simply forgot about or threw away the receipt for

some way your payees won t be able to deposit or cash the check even if you ve filled it out correctly some banks will accept a current address hand written onto a check with an old address but contact your bank first to make sure this is acceptable 1 x research source check that you have the funds to cover the check if you have an online banking portal log in to make sure you have the necessary funds in your account before you write and hand over the check if you don t have online access to your account information stop by the bank or an atm and check your balance that way failing to verify funds before writing a check has serious consequences first of all your payees won t get the money you intended for them second your bank and the payees bank will charge you an insufficient funds fee for bouncing the check such fees can be high so it s always worth it to double check your account before committing yourself 2 x research source get a blue or black pen not only is colored ink harder to read but it can also nullify the check or trigger unwanted safety measures like fraud alerts 3 x research source some ball point pens deliver ink in such a way that it smudges easily which can obscure important information on the check and if it smudges to the point of illegibility even cause the check to get rejected you can avoid unwanted smudging by making sure that you select a pen and ink that doesn t bleed easily never use a pencil to write a check it can be easily altered to reflect an amount or payee which is different from your original intention 4 x research source make sure you have all the correct information check the spelling of your payees names and make sure you know the proper amount to assign to the check while most financial institutions will accept and cash checks if a payee s name is misspelled you shouldn t bank on this likelihood 5 x research source avoid any potential delays or confusion by double checking your payees information beforehand date the check in the date field on the check write today s date this is important because it dictates how long the payee will have to deposit or cash the check most banks will refuse to cash or deposit a check that is more than six months old so make sure your payees know to use the check as soon as possible 6 x research source decide whether you want one or both parties to endorse the check this determines whether you ll separate the names using and or or on the payable to line use and if you want both individuals to sign the check alternately use a plus sign or comma in place of and choosing this option means that neither party can do anything with the check unless they have express consent and cooperation from the other payee so it s a good idea to use this option if you aren t very familiar with the payees relationship or whether or not they have a joint account 7 x research source use or if you want only one of the parties to endorse the check this means that either payee can cash or deposit the check with only their own endorsement this is a good option if you know your payees very well and can be sure neither party would use the check without the other s knowledge in this case it makes the process more convenient for the payees since either of them can deposit or cash the check at any time 8 x research source be aware that even if you decide to use or to link the payees names the bank might use their discretion to require both parties to sign in any case this policy varies from bank to bank and is designed to protect both bank and customer from fraudulent activity 9 x research source write the names of both payees on the payable to line separate the two names with either and or or depending on what you decided regarding how many payees should have to endorse the check for example if paying two individuals with different last names write john doe and or jane smith 10 x research source find out if the two payees have the same surname if so you won t need to repeat the last name on the payable to line for example if paying a married couple address the couple as mr and mrs john doe instead of jane doe and john doe if the couple is married but keeping distinct last names or if the two payees are linked by business purposes you will need to enter both their full names use cursive or block letters to print legibly while it used to be customary to write checks in cursive modern practice permits either cursive or block letters 11 x research source the most important thing is legibility use whichever writing form that you do best fill out all other required fields on the check this includes the numerical dollar amount written dollar amount and your own signature 12 x research source record the check in your personal register write down the number of the check you ve just written as well as its amount and the payees in your paper register or online service such as quickbooks this will allow you to keep track of your expenditures and balance your checkbook even if the payee hasn t cashed or deposited the check yet 13 x research source if you write a lot of checks you should keep a memo or other notation system

how to stop payment on a lost check,if you have a checking account with a united states bank federal law provides you the right to stop payment on a lost check but you have to act fast you need exact information about the check and you must visit a bank branch in person to complete the stop payment order before the check is presented to the bank 1 x research source depending on the circumstances in which you lost the check you may want to consider closing your checking account or reporting possible identity theft,check your account statement before you initiate a stop payment on the check you need to make sure it has not yet gone through if your bank has already accepted the check a stop payment won t do you any good 2 x research source typically it s easier to check your recent transactions on your online account or on your banking mobile app if you have one make sure the check has not cleared and also check your pending transactions to make sure it hasn t been presented yet if the check does not appear take action to initiate the stop payment order immediately if you lost a checkbook or a series of blank checks be aware that a stop payment order may not resolve your problems your best solution may be simply to close your bank account contact your bank the moment you discover that a check is lost gather information about the check and call your bank s customer service number as soon as possible most banks have a toll free number with operators available 24 hours a day seven days a week 3 x research source typically you will need your bank account number the number of the check the exact amount for which you wrote the check and the exact name of the person or business to which you wrote the check if you have a joint account you can stop payment on the check even if the other account owner wrote it however you probably will need to provide that information as well the operator will take the information and let you know what you need to do next go to a branch in person while you can initiate a stop payment over the phone typically you must go into the branch nearest you and complete some official paperwork before the stop payment goes into effect 4 x research source if you don t go to the bank to authorize the stop payment order in writing within 14 days of the date you called the bank the order will lapse keep in mind that these are calendar days not business days the bank typically will have forms for you to fill out and sign to put the stop payment order into effect make sure you get copies of everything you sign for your records you may want to create a separate file to keep all information associated with your stop payment order so you have everything together you will have to pay a fee to place a stop payment order typically about the same amount as you would pay for a returned check you may have to pay the fee separately or the bank may simply withdraw it from your checking account provided the funds are available monitor your checking account even if you have a stop payment order in effect the bank still may pay the check if it is presented under the law the bank can still do this if the stop payment order was not received in time or if you didn t provide full and correct information about the check 5 x research source for example suppose you wrote a check to a company called jerry s jams and jellies llc and that s the name you put on your stop payment order however you actually wrote the check to jerry s jams your stop payment order might not stop that check from going through at that point you would need to contact the bank if they tell you that the information on the stop payment order was insufficient you can argue that they reasonably should have known that jerry s jams was the same thing as jerry s jams and jellies llc the check also might go through anyway if for example you entered the wrong check number or you wrote the wrong amount on the stop payment order keep in mind this doesn t need to be a significant difference if you were off by even a few pennies the bank may still honor the check despite your stop payment order mark the expiration date on your calendar in most cases your stop payment order will expire six months from the date it was issued at that point you ll need to assess the situation and decide whether you want to renew the stop payment order for another six months 6 x research source keep in mind that if you decide to renew the stop payment order you typically must go to a bank branch again in person to sign the official forms and you ll have to pay another fee under federal law banks are not obligated to pay a check that is more than six months old however the still may charge your account 7 x research source if the check is still unaccounted for you may want to renew your stop payment order assess the potential damage the fees for a stop payment order may be so high relative to the face value of the check that a stop payment order doesn t make any sense or if one or several checks were lost or stolen the potential financial harm may be great 8 x research source if the costs outweigh the benefits of getting a stop payment order it may make more sense for you simply to close your checking account although switching bank accounts can be a hassle you won t have to continue to pay stop payment fees or have to worry about whether that check will go through anyway closing your checking account also might be a good idea if the check was for a significant amount of money although the stop payment fee is relatively low in that case compared to the amount of the check if the check was honored anyway it would be a much bigger deal visit a bank branch in person if you decide you want to go ahead and close your checking account and open a new one you should speak to someone at the bank in person they will get the paperwork you need and help you do this more efficiently 9 x research source make sure to bring with you information about your account such as your account number and a government issued photo id you may want to check with your bank before you go to make sure you don t need anything else such as proof of your address if you have any other checks out or purchases that haven t hit your account yet you may want to make a list of them so you know how much money to keep in your old account despite this your bank may require you to keep a specific minimum amount of money there for 30 days before they finally close the account if you have a joint account the other account holder typically will need to be present when you make arrangements to close the account set up a new checking account generally it s a good idea to go ahead and set up a new checking account while you re waiting for confirmation that your old checking account ha fully closed that way you can start the process of switching things over 10 x research source for example if you get paid by direct deposit you may want to start having your checks deposited in your new account rather than your old one with some banks you can go ahead and set up a new checking account online but you may want to do it in person regardless so you can explain your situation destroy your old checks and debit cards once you have a new checking account you want to make sure that you don t use your old checks or debit cards by mistake not only do you risk a returned check but your bank may extend the waiting period before your account is closed 11 x research source make sure you dispose of old checks and debit cards properly so you re not at risk if they fall into the wrong hands use a paper shredder if you have one or cut them up into tiny pieces transfer recurring payments if you have any subscriptions or bills set up on automatic payment you ll want to switch these over from your old account to your new one check your most recent account statement and make a list 12 x research source if you have recurring payments that only happen every few months you may want to go back several account statements to make sure you have everything your bank also may be able to provide you a list of recurring payments you ve authorized if you have a joint account you also want to check with the other account holder to make sure they don t have any recurring payments authorized move your funds once your bank finally closes your old account they ll send you a letter confirming the account has been closed typically with a check for your final balance 13 x research source you can simply deposit that check in your new account or you may be able to make arrangements with your bank to have the final balance in your old account automatically transferred to your new one monitor your accounts particularly if you ve lost more than one check or if your purse or wallet was lost or stolen you need to be vigilant for other possible unauthorized activity if you spot anything unusual notify the bank or credit card company as soon as

a moment to gather everything in one place and make log sheets that you can use to keep track of phone calls emails and other interactions with bank credit card or government officials 15 x research source as you go through this process you need to get written documentation of every interaction that takes place since you may have to provide the same information to more than one person it s a good idea to keep it all together set up a filing system for originals of all correspondence and other personal documents as well as copies print a blank calendar that you can use to mark deadlines related

probably need to check the other two as well set an initial fraud alert on your credit there are three nationwide credit reporting agencies in the united states you only have to contact one of them to place a fraud alert the one you contacted is then responsible for contacting the other two 17 x research source you can contact equifax at 1 800 525 6285 experian at 1 888 397 3742 or transunion at 1

how to prove check kiting,when you write a check it typically takes a couple of days for the payment to clear in the banking world this is called the float period you might ve written a check at some point knowing there wasn t enough money in your bank account to cover it at that moment but that more money would be deposited in the account before the check cleared for example you might write a check the day before payday however with check kiting someone uses 2 bank accounts to write a check from one bank account to the other then takes the cash before the check clears 1 x research source although banks can lose millions of dollars in check kiting schemes individuals and small business owners can also fall victim,look at the pattern of deposits over the past 3 months if someone is involved in a check kiting scheme they likely have numerous deposits from the same bank account sometimes you ll see several checks from the same payor in a single day this is a red flag that likely indicates check kiting 2 x research source check kiting typically involves unusual patterns of payments and withdrawals separate the pattern from the possible excuse for the pattern for example the person might say that they have multiple payments from the same person because that person is paying them back for something however it s unlikely that someone would write multiple checks in one day they d simply write one mixed transactions where the person deposits checks and takes part of the deposited amount back in cash can also be a sign of check kiting especially if they occur frequently track down the owners of accounts with frequent deposits typically a check kiter either has ultimate control or has access to all of the accounts being used in the check kiting scheme if the check kiter is using accomplices to run the other accounts they are likely associated in some way 3 x research source for example a check kiter might have their significant other or a family member open an account to use in the scheme the other person might not even be aware that the check kiter is planning to use the account for fraudulent purposes if a check kiter has access to a business account they might use the business account in their check kiting scheme without the knowledge of the business owners determine which bank branches were used to make deposits check kiting operations require depositing a significant number of checks often check kiters will make deposits at multiple different branches so their volume of deposits doesn t attract suspicion 4 x research source if you locate the branches used you can typically identify a path along which the check kiter travels to make their deposits each day you may be able to fit in the other bank where checks are coming from as well talk to bank tellers about the suspected customer if the check kiter makes their deposits in person bank tellers can positively identify them and provide information about the frequency with which they make deposits they can also tell you if the check kiter is operating the other account from which the checks are written 5 x research source because check kiting operations typically require a significant volume of checks a check kiter will likely be a regular customer at the bank branches they use the most frequently so the tellers there will know them by sight for example the check kiter might be using a bank account opened by a friend or family member but they re the one who is always taking the checks to that bank to deposit in that account a teller might be able to recognize the check kiter especially if they re a frequent customer investigate the owners of the accounts involved sophisticated check kiters may have accomplices who open accounts in different banks however with most check kiting schemes the ownership of the bank accounts involved in the schemes can ultimately be traced back to a single individual showing that one individual had control over all the accounts used in the scheme provides evidence of a fraudulent intent 6 x research source even if someone else owned an account the check kiter might have access to it for example if a business account is used in a check kiting scheme the check kiter might not own the business but might be an employee with access to checks look at the pattern of withdrawals if someone is intentionally writing bad checks they ll withdraw cash from their account without regard to whether there s enough money in that account to cover checks that have been written but haven t cleared the account yet repeatedly withdrawing large sums of cash while there are still checks that haven t cleared can be a sign that the person is engaging in fraudulent activity 7 x research source repeated mixed transactions can also be a good sign of fraudulent intent for example if the person routinely takes the maximum amount of a check deposit in cash and those checks are routinely returned by the other bank you can infer fraudulent intent show consistency in the pattern of check writing it might not be all that unusual for someone to have multiple checks from the same person or even use multiple checks between two accounts that they own to transfer funds however if those checks are routinely returned for insufficient funds continuing to take checks from the same source can show an intent to defraud the bank 8 x research source if a reputable person receives a check that is returned for insufficient funds they would be unlikely to take another check from the same check writer again instead they would require a more secure form of payment look at the dates the checks are written to establish the check writer s knowledge of float times if the checks are routinely written every two or three days it shows that they re aware of how long it takes a check to clear and are using bad checks to fraudulently inflate the balances of the accounts establish that the check writer ignored bad check notices when a check you write is returned you ll receive a notice from the bank that the check was returned for insufficient funds if the check writer ignored these notices or failed to make deposits to cover the negative balance this provides circumstantial evidence that the check writer knew what they were doing and intended to write bad checks 9 x research source if a check writer is using another account such as a business account you might also uncover efforts by the check writer to hide the notices from the owner of the account accept check payments only for the exact amount owed if you sell items or services a customer might offer to write you a check for more than the amount they owe then ask you to give them cash for the difference however if you do this and then the check is returned by the bank you can become an unwitting participant in a check kiting scheme 10 x research source in online transactions a check kiter might send you payment then send a message informing you that they accidentally paid you too much typically they ll ask for you to pay the difference by wiring them cash or buying a gift card rather than simply accepting a refund offer to return an overpayment after the check clears if someone overpays you with a check and wants a refund of the overpayment you can also tell them that you ll be happy to do that after the check clears if the person is trying to defraud you they typically won t be willing to wait for that to happen because they know the check won t clear 11 x research source keep in mind that your bank will likely make the funds available in your account before the check technically clears refuse to pay any refund until the check no longer says pending in your bank account look into checks that clear your bank account out of sequence checks that clear out of sequence might indicate that someone has stolen a checkbook and is using your bank account for a check kiting scheme this is typically a bigger risk with business checking accounts that have numerous transactions every day as a matter of course 12 x research source for example when you look at your bank account you might notice a series of checks starting with 7999 even though the regular checks you re using start with 3999 checks out of sequence might also indicate that someone has ordered checks on the account starting at a different number than the checks you re currently using restrict access to company checks if you re a business owner a check kiter can use your company checks to perpetuate a check kiting scheme without your knowledge if your company checks aren t properly secured require authorization for written checks especially for large amounts and never sign blank checks 13 x research source an employee who has access to the business account without oversight can use those checks in a check kiting scheme avoid this by separating check writing duties so that the person who prepares the check cannot also sign the check keep all blank checks in a locked safe with restricted access when you order new checks secure them immediately if you don t receive a check order contact your bank immediately,Finance-and-Business

establish a new account however gaining an understanding of your situation and realizing that there are checking accounts designed for people in your situation can help put you back in control if you find yourself in this position you may want to see whether you can get a second chance checking account,understand the limitations second chance checking accounts are burdened with certain limitations on the account holder these may include fewer conveniences a lower spending limit a higher and unavoidable monthly fee a higher initial deposit no overdraft protection mandatory direct monthly deposit of funds determine the reason banks are denying you a regular checking account you can check with the denying institution to find out whether it has based its decision on information from either chexsystems which reports mishandled accounts and outstanding debts to its member institutions or telechecks which reports fraud and bad checks if it used chexsystems you can order a copy of your report from that company to better understand and in some cases appeal the institution s decision to learn more about the process look at how to get a checking account if you re listed in chexsystems you can talk to a telechecks representative to better understand a denial based on that company s information you may also be denied an account if you have outstanding overdraft fees or if you ve been a victim of identify theft institutions may also use credit reports to judge your risk level and decide whether or not to give you a regular account 1 x research source learn how to read a credit report before trying to get a second chance account financial institutions that do not use chexsystems or telechecks may not have a record of your previous banking problems they would be easier to obtain checking accounts from you can find online directories of financial institutions that do not use these systems if banks continue to reject you for a regular checking account and you aren t sure why ask them for details sometimes banks deny services mistakenly realize that you have not been permanently denied a regular checking account if you have bad credit information stored in the databases of chexsystems or telechecks you will eventually be able to get a checking account again if you exhibit good behavior for a substantial period of time many banks forgive previous bad credit if you pay off debt and don t have problems for two years if information about you in chexsystems or telechecks is fraud related you may have to wait as much as five years before you can re establish a regular checking account 2 x research source if you open a second chance account with a bank that bank may allow you to upgrade to a regular account after a year or so if you prove yourself to be a reliable customer 3 x research source recognize the drawbacks second chance bank accounts are seen as riskier to the banks that offer them for this reason fees are often higher with these accounts than they are with traditional accounts in many cases they will charge a monthly fee if you do not keep a certain balance in your account or deposit a certain amount of money each month these thresholds are generally higher than they are for regular checking accounts however you may be able to find some credit unions or banks that offer fairly good terms without imposing a minimum balance requirement 4 x research source a second chance bank account may not offer premium account features such as free checks overdraft protection or rewards programs 5 x research source consider your other options if you don t want to re enter the banking system yet or are unable to find a second chance checking account you have several other options for managing your finances and paying your bills when looking for these options never use payday lenders or check cashing stores except as an absolute last resort these institutions can charge very high fees or interest rates which in the case of payday lenders can leave you trapped in a cycle of debt if you re not careful instead you should consider these more legitimate options use a prepaid credit card these charge higher fees than checking accounts but can be a convenient way of managing your money keep in mind though that prepaid cards will not help you build up your credit score because no credit is being extended to you get a secured credit card secured credit cards allow you to access a credit line equal to a deposit that you make with the bank so for example if you wanted a 1 000 credit line you would need to deposit 1 000 the benefit here is that this card can allow you to improve your credit score and then qualify for a regular credit card with the lender money orders these are another safe option for paying bills you can get them at many convenient locations such as grocery stores or the post office however you may be limited in the amount of the money order and there will be small fees involved that can build up over time 6 x research source open an account with a local bank explore the websites of banks and credit unions that you are already familiar with to find out if they offer second chance checking accounts many major financial institutions offer these accounts to potential customers with bad credit or with other banking problems often with minimal fees read the institution s checking faq s and use the search terms second chance or opportunity to locate personal checking accounts that may be right for you call the bank s customer service number if you re unable to find the information on the website many banks however do not offer this type of account or may charge high fees try checking with local credit unions 7 x research source major banks may offer these accounts with relatively good terms for example look at wells fargo s opportunity checking account bank of america s safe balance account or pnc s foundation checking 8 x research source if you can t find any banks offering second chance accounts close to you your community may have a program that can help you many localities have a bank on program that works with local banks to provide this type of account search online to see if your area has such a program 9 x research source look for other account providers if you can t find an account provider among banks that you know it s time to search online for accounts when you find unfamiliar institutions offering this type of account review all the information carefully before opening an account make sure you know the name and reputation of the bank review the application for any hidden fees as unscrupulous companies make money from taking advantage of individuals having a difficult time getting checking accounts for example gobank offers online checking accounts to get an account buy a starter kit at walmart or visit gobank s website they charge an 8 95 monthly fee but have no minimum balance requirement 10 x research source compare fees and minimum balances make sure you shop around to find the best deal start by looking for accounts that require a minimum balance you can afford make sure you can afford the monthly fee too or avoid paying it at all by maintaining a certain balance look for other fees that the bank may charge and compare the costs to those of other banks most of this information can be found on the websites of the banks offering the accounts 11 x research source ask about upgrading your account in many cases a customer who opens a second chance checking account and meets the bank s requirements faithfully for six months or a year can qualify to upgrade their account acquiring all of the benefits of a regular checking account after a time you may also be able to qualify for a premium checking account this depends on your relationship with the bank and how well you observe account rules ask the bank about the possibility of upgrading your account and how long that might take the sooner you can upgrade your account the sooner you can be back to financial normalcy 12 x research source apply to get a second chance checking account visit the institution in person or apply online to open your second chance checking account complete the application carefully because misstatements will likely lead to a denial 13 x research source provide any requested documents and submit the minimum deposit make sure you have the minimum opening deposit when you apply for the checking account the documents you will need are the same that you need when opening a regular checking account be sure to bring some form of government id like a driver s license passport birth certificate social security card or state id in addition you ll need proof of address such as a utility bill or lease contract 14 x research source stay in the bank s good graces watch your balance and make sure that it never dips below the minimum requirement avoid overdrafts by thinking about your balance before each payment or purchase pay in full any fees you are charged as soon as you can only by being a good customer and staying on top of your account can you rebuild your good reputation with the banking system 15 x research source immediately contact the bank if you notice any suspicious activity in your account 16 x research source upgrade your account when you can to do so you ll have to convince the bank that you are a reliable customer

each month for the next six months this 6 000 would constitute full settlement of my outstanding credit card debt provide a date for a response at the end of your letter ask the company to respond to

research source for example your opening paragraph may say i am writing to follow up on our telephone conversation of july 16 2016 i made an offer to resolve my credit card account with a single payment of 2 000 but you countered by saying that your company would accept 8 000 present a subsequent offer if possible any negotiation involves give and take between the two parties if you can reasonably increase your offer you should include the newest offer in your letter if however you have reached a point you honestly cannot move beyond you should say so the company will then be forced either to accept your offer or proceed with legal action 13 x research source this latest letter could state i appreciate your request for a payment of 8 000 however i cannot meet your request i am able to offer a final payment of 3 500 in full settlement of my outstanding debt negotiate for the most favorable reporting of the settlement if you pay anything less than the full amount due your credit score is likely to drop however you can try to minimize the damage by modifying the way the company reports the settlement ask them to report your account as paid this is best for you if they

settlement when that occurs you must confirm the agreement by putting it in writing 16 x research source recite the entire agreement accurately in your final settlement letter you must make sure to

is for immediate payment and you are including a check with the letter you must say so periodic payment dates if you are setting up a payment plan the phrase full and final settlement this binds the company legally to this amount and prevents future collection efforts for any additional amounts a description of how the company will report this debt to the credit reporting agencies it makes a difference whether a debt is reported as paid settled or paid late try to negotiate for a reporting of paid provide a space for both signatures you should sign the letter and provide a space at the

correspond to the series the serial number appears in the upper left and lower right corners if the serial number doesn t correspond to the series then you are dealing with a counterfeit if the bill is series 2009 then the serial number should begin with j if the bill is series 2009a then the serial number should begin with l 12 x research source feel franklin s shoulder the new 100 uses raised printing on ben franklin s shoulder run your fingers over the spot you should be able to feel texture 13 x research source check for color change ink there is a large copper colored inkwell to the left of the bill s serial number inside the inkwell is a bell which should change color from copper to green as you look at the bill from different angles 14 x research source the numeral 100 beside the inkwell should also change color just as it does on some older 100 bills hold the bill up to the light an embedded thread runs just to the left of franklin s portrait the letters usa and the

how to make fake money,fake money is a great prop for games educational exercises and stage performances however you must carefully follow all legal rules and regulations when preparing your own play money start the process by dying paper or choosing to use brightly colored sheets then design the currency details by hand or by downloading a money template print or copy the final sheets cut them out and you are ready to go,mix water and coffee in a bowl or pan if don t want bright white paper for your bills then you can try to create a color closer to normal currency by dying it with coffee get a coffee cup and fill it halfway up with hot water add in 3 tablespoons 44 4 ml of instant coffee and stir quickly then pour this mixture into a shallow bowl or pan this should leave you with a deep brown colored liquid 1 x research source if you want your money to only have a slight brownish tint then you can add a bit more warm water to the cup if you don t have instant coffee on hand you can instead use a tea bag steeped in a cup of warm water to create an even more complex color squeeze out 1 2 drops of green food coloring into the mug and stir quickly this will give your currency a greenish tint dip the pieces of printer paper into the water hold a piece of paper above the dish and dip the paper into it try to evenly coat both sides of the paper this will create a uniform color go as quickly as you and avoid saturating the paper to the point of ripping arrange 1 piece of paper on a plate get a microwave safe plate and place a single sheet of paper on it the paper should lie flat right in the middle of the plate you ll need to use separate plates for each piece of paper or you ll have to wait until the single plate that you are using is cooled down after microwaving microwave each piece of paper to dry it set the plate and paper in the microwave and cook it for 20 seconds on high remove the plate and tap your finger against the paper if it still feels wet heat it for another 10 seconds and repeat until it is dry set the finished piece of paper aside repeat the process with a fresh plate and sheet of paper 2 x research source let each piece of paper air dry alternatively if you want to avoid using a microwave lay all of your paper pieces out to dry on baking sheets make sure that they do not overlap as this will increase the drying time you can also hang them up on a clothes line with clothes pins follow all laws and regulations creating any kind of currency is generally regulated by your national government in the united states the final fake bill must be shrunk down to 75 or less of the original bill s size or enlarged to over 150 of the original bill s size the government also encourages anyone who prints fake money to make it one sided check with your national or local government before starting printing any fake money just to be safe 3 x research source you should also note that it is illegal to copy money in color tones in many areas instead you ll probably need to go with black and white bills 4 x research source draw out your currency if you d like to avoid the computer and printer you can use a pen to sketch currency images directly on to your paper place a piece of real currency on the paper and then trace around its edges use a fine tipped pen to draw additional details inside the bill s outline this is an especially great way to make fake money for kid s activities as it allows you or them to put all sorts of images on a bill download play money worksheets get on your computer and search for play money templates or play money worksheets download the document and fill it out with any extra details some templates allow you to change the dates or text on the currency you can also adjust the print size so that the currency follows any laws 5 x research source some educational currency websites will even let you put your own photo or another image in the center of the bill use watermarked government money images the treasury department of the united states provides images of currency that can be downloaded and printed out for educational reasons via their official website other financial groups such as the european central bank offer the same service as well go online pull up one of these files and then you are ready to print 6 x research source many of these entities offer images of both coin and bill currency buy from a prop company prop companies are businesses that you can find online or through costume stores they make sets of fake currency for movies plays or other performances you can generally request more detailed bills or just generic stacks that can be realistic from afar this is also a good way to get fake money that you know conforms to all legal rules and regulations however buying fake money from a prop company can be pricey make sure that you understand exactly what you are getting for your money most companies will require that you purchase a roll or stack of bills not just a single bill print out your currency add your dyed or colored paper into the printer s paper feeder double check your printer settings to make sure the currency is fitted to the page then print a single page at a time or multiple pages at once for the best quality use a laser printer create multiple copies if you have a print out of a sheet of currency you can place this in a copier and make additional ones you can also make copies of real bills but you ll need to keep these black and white to follow the law you ll also need to change the size settings to either 150 larger or 75 smaller than standard bills 7 x research source you can also make two sided copies of currency using most copiers cut your bills out if all of your bills are the same size place the sheet or stack of sheets inside a paper cutter and use it to cut them apart this will create the most uniform smooth edges however if the currency is different sizes grab a pair of scissors and carefully cut around the sides 8 x research source add a band around the bills get cash straps from your local bank or office supply store you can also use heavy wide rubber bands use a permanent marker to write the name of a bank across the strap then place a stack of bills inside and you are ready to go,Finance-and-Business
how to detect counterfeit us money,if you have a bill in your possession and are unsure of its authenticity follow these steps to certify the real value of your money it is illegal to possess produce or use counterfeit money if a prosecutor can prove that you have intent to defraud federal law can punish you with a fine and maximum 20 years in prison if you acquire a counterfeit banknote you must turn it in to the appropriate authorities,feel the texture of the paper counterfeit money will often feel distinctly different from authentic money authentic money is made from cotton and linen fibers this differs significantly from normal paper which is made from trees real money is made to be more durable and should feel crisp despite its age normal paper becomes torn and soft when worn the paper that banknotes are printed on is not sold commercially also the chemical composition of the paper and ink is confidential even if you do not have much experience in spotting a counterfeit you should notice a clear difference in texture genuine currency has slightly raised ink that is produced in the intaglio printing process you should be able to feel the texture of this ink especially if you are holding a new dollar bill run your fingernail over the portrait s vest of the bill you should feel distinctive ridges counterfeiters cannot reproduce this notice the thinness of the bill genuine money is often thinner than counterfeit money the process for making money involves applying thousands of pounds of pressure during the printing process as a result real money should feel thinner and crisper than regular paper 1 x research source the only option available to most counterfeiters is to use thin rag paper which can be purchased at most office supply stores still this paper should feel thicker than authentic money compare the bill with another of the same denomination and series different denominations will look different so get a note of the same amount if you are still suspicious about the quality of a bill holding it next to a bill you know is authentic may help you feel a difference all denominations except the 1 and 2 have been redesigned at least once since 1990 so it is best to compare the suspect bill to one in the same series or date while the look of money has changed over the years the distinctive feel has been left largely unchanged the feel of a bill made 50 years ago should feel similar to a brand new dollar bill inspect the printing quality fake bills tend to have a relative flatness and lack of detail because making real currency involves printing methods that are unknown and therefore extremely hard to replicate counterfeiters are often forced to improvise real u s bills are printed using techniques that regular offset printing and digital printing the most popular tools for common counterfeiters cannot replicate look for blurry areas especially in fine details such as around the borders look for colored fibers in the paper all u s bills have tiny red and blue fibers embedded in the paper counterfeiters sometimes try to reproduce these by printing or drawing these fibers onto the paper as a result the blue and red fibers will appear to be printed on the paper instead of being part of the paper itself look at the borders the outside border of real money should be clear and unbroken according to secret service officials 2 x research source on federal reserve and treasury seals the saw tooth points of the borders should be sharp and well defined on genuine bills seals on a counterfeit bill often have uneven blunt or broken saw tooth points look for bleeding ink because of the difference in printing methods between real and fake bills the border ink can sometimes bleed on a fake observe the portrait look at the picture of the person on the bill there are specific discrepancies that will tell you if the bill is fake portraits in fake bills may appear dull blurred and flat while in real currency the portraits are sharp and contain very fine detailing on a real bill the portrait tends to stand out from the background on counterfeit bills the portrait s coloring tends to blend too much with the bill use a magnifying glass to closely observe the rim of the portrait there should be the phrase the united states of america repeated along the sides of the portrait this will look like a solid line to the naked eye this feature is especially hard to replicate using office machine copiers or printers due to its size and detail examine the serial numbers there should be two serial numbers located on the face of the bill on either side of the portrait look at the bill carefully and make sure that the serial numbers match look at the color of the serial numbers on the bill and compare it to the color of the treasury seal if they do not match the bill is likely a fake fake bills may have serial numbers that are not evenly spaced or that are not perfectly aligned in a row if you receive multiple suspicious bills see if the serial numbers are the same on across all bills counterfeiters often neglect to change serial numbers on fake bills if they are the same then they are counterfeit notes 3 x research source hold the bill up to the light for all bills except 1 and 2 dollar bills there should be a security thread plastic strip running from top to bottom the thread is embedded in not printed on the paper and runs vertically through the clear field to the left of the federal reserve seal on authentic bills this should be easily visible against a light source the printing should say usa followed by the denomination of the bill which is spelled out for 10 and 20 bills but presented in numerals on the 5 50 and 100 bills these threads are placed in different places on each denomination to prevent lower denomination bills being bleached and reprinted as higher denominations you should be able to read the inscriptions from both the front or back of the note also it should only be visible against a light source use an ultraviolet black light to look at security threads plastic strips in high denomination bills should glow a specific color the 5 dollar bill should glow blue the 10 bill should glow orange the 20 bill should glow green the 50 bill should glow yellow the 100 bill should glow pink if your bill remains white under a black light it is likely a counterfeit check for watermarks use natural light to see if your bill bears an image of the person whose portrait is on the bill hold the bill up to a light to check for a watermark a watermark bearing the image of the person whose portrait is on the bill can be found on all 10 20 50 and 100 bills series 1996 and later and on 5 bills series 1999 and later the watermark is embedded in the paper to the right of the portrait and should be visible from both sides of the bill tilt the bill to examine the color shifting ink color shifting ink is ink that appears to change color when the bill is tilted color shifting ink can be found on 100 50 and 20 dollar bills series 1996 and later and on 10 dollar bills series 1999 and later 5 and lower bills do not yet have this feature the color originally appeared to change from green to black but it goes from copper to green in recent redesigns of the bills examine the micro printing this includes small words or numbers that are hardly visible to the naked eye and cannot be read without a magnifying glass beginning in 1990 very tiny printing was added to certain places which have periodically been changed since then on 5 and higher denomination bills don t worry about a specific location since micro printing is hard to duplicate counterfeits usually tend not to have any counterfeits with micro printing tend to have blurred letters or numbers on a genuine bill the micro printing will be crisp and clear do not create counterfeit money it is illegal to possess produce or use counterfeit money if a prosecutor can prove that you have intent to defraud federal law can punish you with a fine and maximum 20 years in prison if it is passed to you do not pass the counterfeit currency on to anyone other by following these instructions inspect bills the moment you are suspicious remember who gave you which bills if you acquire a counterfeit banknote you must turn it into the secret service not reporting counterfeit banknotes makes you vulnerable to someone else turning you in for counterfeit banknotes remember the passer if possible delay whoever passed you the counterfeit money to remember as much about that person s appearance as possible take note of any accomplices or companions write down their license plate number if applicable the person who gives you counterfeit money might not be the original counterfeiter they too might be an innocent civilian duped into using fake money it might be impossible to match each passer to each specific bill so many people inspect bills the moment they are handed to them for example many cashiers at general stores will inspect large denomination bills before accepting them as payment this way the cashier in the moment can link any potential passer to any potentially counterfeit bill contact the authorities find your local police department or united states secret service field office these numbers can be found on the inside front page of your local telephone directory or through online search avoid handling the banknote carefully place it in a protective covering such as an envelope or sandwich bag this is so that authorities can glean as much information as possible from the banknote fingerprints compounds and chemicals how it was printed and so on this is also so that you cannot forget which banknote was forged and others are not mistaken write down your information write your initials and the date in the white border areas of the suspect banknote or on the envelope bag the date identifies when the counterfeit was noticed and your initials identify who noticed the counterfeit fill out the secret service counterfeit report when you hand in a counterfeit note you must fill out the department of homeland security s counterfeit note report find the form here the url is http www secretservice gov forms ssf1604 pdf once a note is handed in with this form it is considered counterfeit unless proven otherwise fill out 1 form for each suspected banknote this form is geared towards banks who catch counterfeit money but individuals should use it as well if you found the counterfeit bill at a bank and you are an employee of the bank contact your manager and fill out this form regarding your employer give the banknote to authorities surrender the note or coin only to a properly identified police officer or a u s secret service special agent when asked relay as much information as possible about the passer accomplices or any other information you remember about receiving the counterfeit money you will not be financially reimbursed

how to detect fake euros,the euro is the national currency for some 340 million people in nineteen european countries and there are roughly thirteen billion paper notes in circulation 1 x research source it should be no surprise then that counterfeiting is an ongoing problem with euros if you are familiar with the basic features of each euro denomination and know how to check the advanced security features embedded within each bill the vast majority of fake euros can be detected,recognize proper styles and colors first and foremost you should be aware that euro bills come only in denominations of 5 10 20 50 100 200 and 500 so if you are handed a 15 note reject it immediately each legitimate euro denomination also has a standard color palette and image style 2 x research source euros feature distinctive styles of architectural imagery from different periods of european history the front of each bill shows a window door or gate motif the rear a bridge along with a map of europe five euro bills feature classical architecture and are predominantly gray in color ten euro bills feature romanesque architecture and are predominantly red in color twenty euro bills feature gothic architecture and are predominantly blue in color fifty euro bills feature renaissance architecture and are predominantly orange in color one hundred euro bills feature baroque rococo architecture and are predominantly green in color two hundred euro bills feature iron and glass architecture and are predominantly yellow brown in color five hundred euro bills feature modern architecture and are predominantly purple in color measure the bills unlike u s currency for instance euro bills are different sizes this hinders counterfeiting somewhat but is mainly done for the benefit of the visually impaired 3 x research source 5 120 x 62 mm 10 127 x 67 mm 20 133 x 72 mm 50 140 x 77 mm 100 147 x 82 mm 200 153 x 82 mm 500 160 x 82 mm feel the distinctive paper euros are made of 100 cotton fiber which enhances durability and gives the bills a distinctive feel real euros should feel crisp and firm and the print should feel raised in areas where the ink is thicker 4 x research source fake euros tend to feel limp and waxy to the touch and often lack the raised print texture the older and more worn the euro bill is the more difficult it may be to distinguish these features even then however an experienced handler of euros can likely tell the difference look out for the europa series the european central bank has over the past few years been slowly rolling out a new series of euro bills these are widely known as the europa series because some of the major security enhancements involve imagery of the greek mythological figure europa 5 x research source these bills include a watermark portrait of europa a female visible when the bill is held up to light they also include a hologram image of europa in the silver security stripe which becomes visible when the bill is tilted watch for the watermark all euros have a watermark image that becomes visible when the bill is held up to light the image replicates an architectural image from the bill it is located on the left side of the front of each bill 6 x research source on real euros the watermark is created by a variation in the actual paper thickness the image will be clearly visible when held up to light and there will be smooth transitions between the light and dark elements of the image on fake euros the watermark is usually printed onto the paper the image is usually not as clear and often there are sharp light dark transitions when it is held up to light handle the hologram all euros feature a hologram image depending on denomination it will appear either as a vertical stripe or a rectangle on the right side of the front of the bill tilting the bill s orientation in relation to your eyes will reveal changes in the image 7 x research source on real euros the hologram will clearly change when tilted the actual image varies by denomination and series the newer europa series utilizes her portrait for instance fake euros usually lack an actual hologram meaning the image remains static when the bill is tilted study the security thread all euro denominations include a security thread which appears as a vertical stripe in the center left area of the front of the bill the thread is not printed on the bill but is actually embedded in it 8 x research source the security stripe on real euros always appears as a very dark stripe when held up to light it also includes in tiny but clear lettering the number denomination and the word euro or in the new series on fake euros the security stripe is usually just a printed grayish black line it does not appear very dark when held up to light and usually has micro printing that is either blurry or nonexistent check for color changes in addition to holograms euros also utilize color shifting elements when bills are tilted look for the numeral value of the bill on the back right note however that only denominations of fifty euros and above use this technology 9 x research source the denomination numeral on the back of a real euro will shift in color from purple to green or brown depending on denomination when tilted most fake euros lack this effect meaning the numeral remains purple when tilted mind the micro printing micro printing that is illegible to the naked eye but becomes clear under magnification requires sophisticated printing techniques that are beyond the ability of most counterfeiters all euro bills utilize some micro printing elements depending on denomination and series they can appear in the word euro or the star decal for instance 10 x research source to the naked eye micro printing on legitimate euros will appear as a thin line with the aid of a magnifying glass however clear print will be visible a running repetition of the numeral denomination of the bill is commonly found in micro printing on fake euros the micro printing is normally either blurry under magnification or non existent a good magnifying glass is therefore a handy tool when you need to weed out possible fake bills uncover ultraviolet and infrared properties holding euros up to standard light sources reveals many of the key security features using ultraviolet uv or infrared technology however reveals special features as well 11 x research source real euros do not emit a glow under uv light fibers embedded in the bill do however emit areas of coloring that vary by denomination newer bills emit three colors under uv light under infrared light only the far right side of the printing on the front of a real euro including a small bit of the architectural image and the hologram will remain visible under uv light fake euros usually emit a bright glow and reveal the fake watermark and security thread as dark lines the text and images of fake euros are usually either completely visible or invisible under infrared light,Finance-and-Business
how to detect counterfeit trade dollars,counterfeit trade dollars have pretty much flooded the market over the past decade buyers of trade dollars had better know what they re buying and if you don t know how to tell a counterfeit from the real thing you are best off just buying coins graded by pcgs ngc or another recognized service that certifies the authenticity of the coin here is a listing of a number of points you need to consider while starting to build your trade dollar collection,you can find a hole behind the ladies head where the ribbon curls where the metal is chipped out manually the eagle s eye will be full on a real coin the eagle s eye is half shut the true way to identify fake coins is through their weight fake coins are silver washed over copper and weigh around 18 grams whereas a real trade dollar will weigh 27 22 grams 0 96 oz 1 x research source check for the price at which the trade coins are being offered real trade dollars coins sell for around us 20 for an average conditioned coin if you are being offered for a lower price then we would probably have to check out why the sellers offer them at this price check the coin s numbers and letters for the same design or font of other like coins 2 x research source check whether the size of the coin appears in the same size as other like coins examine the metal texture and compare it to authentic coins of the same type you could also identify fake ones through coin turn most of the fake coins does not have a coin turn in other words when you flip the coin normally the reverse is almost upside down,Finance-and-Business
how to identify counterfeit money,one of history s oldest crimes is counterfeiting money and it the problem continues to grow for example the united states secret service removed move than 182 million in fake currency from circulation in 2009 1 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source business owners private

comparing bills or using devices that detect fakes you can identify counterfeit money,learn about currency printing if you want to examine or compare bills you receive for counterfeits it s a good idea to have a little knowledge about how currency is printed from the fact that design and material can change over time taking a few minutes to learn about currency could save you money or even legal hassles 4 x research source recognize that looking at the security features of a bill such as watermarks or raised areas is usually enough to detect fakes without the aid of a device 5 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source be aware that most countries or regions such as the european union have series of bills in circulation issued after specific dates notes are often taken out of circulation as counterfeiting gets more sophisticated but also because the average life span of notes varies 6 x research source check out resources such as the us currency education program cep or the european central bank to learn more about the design legal status and life cycle of bills as well as how you can spot fakes 7 x research source observe standard features most currencies come with different features that help identify them such as colors seals and watermarks 8 x research source however there are often a few standard features that can guide your examination including portraits or images watermarks colored or color shifting ink security thread or ribbon serial numbers inspect the paper notes are often made of material other than paper for example us notes are made with a mixture of 25 linen and 75 cotton and european bills with cotton in addition bills may have randomly dispersed security fibers throughout the note be aware it may be difficult to detect some of these features with the naked eye and may require more in depth analysis run your finger along the note s surface many currencies including the dollar and euro have raised printing which gives them their special texture 9 x research source look at the bill s portraits most countries or currency unions have some type of image on their notes as a security measure check any notes you have for images which may also include special features such as holograms 10 x research source research central bank sites for specific portrait information for example benjamin franklin appears on the 100 note and is slightly off center in india you ll find mahatma ghandi on most notes check the watermark most notes in circulation in world currencies were printed at a specific time and have a watermark to help authenticate them 11 x research source the watermark is often visible from either side when the note is held up to a source of light put each side of the bill up to a window that has access to sunlight and make sure you can see the watermark on both sides before using it 12 x research source consider using other sources of light such as a uv light or a lamp and use the same procedure to check for the watermark watch the ink color shift or holograms many bills used have colored or color shifting ink and or holograms moving the bill back and forth can help verify that the note isn t counterfeit 13 x research source look for the ink on the face of bills and recognize color shifting ink and holograms by tilting the bill back and forth if you can t find this the note may be counterfeit be aware that some smaller note denominations may not have the same security features as larger notes find the security thread or ribbon many countries such as the united states thailand and india use security threads to further authenticate their bills 14 x research source using either a uv light source or your naked eye look for this marker to ensure your bill isn t counterfeit look for clear or colored threads that are embedded in notes in some cases this feature may only be visible when held to light check with the state s central bank to see if there are further special features with security threads for example threads in us dollars glow with the number of the denomination under uv light read the serial numbers in addition to other features many countries have bills that contain serial numbers which help identify when and where it was made 15 x research source check for serial numbers which may be a combination of letters and numbers to help ensure the money is not counterfeit check with the central bank of any country you re visiting for information on serial numbers for example the united states provides data on the serial numbers of dollars you can similarly get this information from countries like thailand and india as well as the european union 16 x research source use central bank resources most countries or customs unions have central banks that provide information on their currency if you are looking for information about elements such as specific placement of face or back plate numbers or even want to see up close examples of how to review standard authentication features you can draw upon the resources that central banks or currency issuers provide 17 x research source correlate two bills you can easily check for fake money by comparing two bills of the same denomination use or obtain an authentic bill from the bank and compare the various aspects of the bill that looks suspicious see if you can detect any differences between the notes by sight look at both sides of each bill this may confirm your suspicion that you received counterfeit money place the authentic bill on top of the suspicious bill hold them up to the light which may expose any differences between the notes make sure to report any counterfeit money and the person from who you received it to your local authorities 18 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source if you do not know the person who passed you the money provide the authorities with any information you can that may help them apprehend the counterfeiter 19 x trustworthy source consumer reports nonprofit organization dedicated to consumer advocacy and product testing go to source mark the note with a detector pen some companies have begun making felt tip pens that can detect counterfeit bills draw a line or an x on suspicious bill to see if it leaves a mark which can indicate a counterfeit bill 20 x research source be aware that detector pens are not foolproof but work in many cases because their active ingredient which is an iodine solution reacts with wood based paper 21 x research source realize that a detector pen may leave a pastel mark on an authentic bill and that it will fade within a day 22 x research source this can help you identify which bills you ve checked purchase counterfeit detector pens at most large retailers or office supply stores they generally cost around 5 and can

set up automatic withdrawals from your checking account every month to pay for your credit card this way you won t risk forgetting about your payments and registering as a late payer dropping your credit score automatic payments usually let you specify whether you want to register to pay the monthly minimum credit cards will force you to pay a small amount every month or risk a penalty register

set amount every month this set amount can be somewhere in between the monthly minimum and the balance payments realize that this method might not work for everyone if it doesn t follow another way of establishing credit get a seasoned credit card reference this is also called being an authorized user this is a method that at least 30 of americans have used you get added to credit card that has perfect payment histories and a balance below 30 you don t even have to have access to he credit card for this method to work using this method you can build good credit fast 2 x research source just make sure that the card is reported to the major credit reporting companies keep a job many places asking for your credit score will also look at other information like if you can keep down a job if they see you re changing jobs every few months then your credit score won t really be enough to help you you ll look too risky keep down one job for a few years at a time to appear more stable this will help you with things like getting a mortgage 3 x research source if you appear reliable they may be willing to forgive a slightly less than ideal credit score stay in one place much like the above many places will look at your housing history if you move too much you re a risk however if you stay in one apartment or house you seem much more reliable 4 x research source apply for a credit card choose one that offers the lowest interest rate and if possible one that offers a cash back percentage on purchases you make try not to start a new credit card until you have at least okay credit because each application counts against your score as does being denied apply for a major credit card such as visa american express discover or mastercard these will help you move into the 700 score territory faster if you can t get a major credit card think about getting a secured credit card which works after you deposit money with an issuing bank essentially a debit card open checking and savings accounts lenders see bank accounts as signs of financial stability and consistent savings behavior given this evidence of continuous use of checking and savings accounts increases your chances that a bank will offer you a credit card 5 x research source you shouldn t however just open accounts left and right as this makes you look bad rather than good just have more than one and make sure that there s money in each of them alternatively contact your bank or credit union open a charge account with them and deposit a specific amount of money into the account this is called a pre paid charge account keep debt low it will look better if the bill you are paying at the end of the month is a low one keep your outstanding debt as low as possible in order to improve your score even further ask for help if you ve done a good job of building an okay score and then find that you re very slightly late on a single payment you may be able to get that late payment taken off your record by asking very nicely if you have a good history with the entity you were late in paying they may be willing to take it off if you ask give it time having good credit over a long period of time will go a long way towards convincing lenders that you re a solid bet don t rush the process check your budget budget out how much money you have coming in how much money you d like to save and what sorts of things you need to pay for on a monthly basis having a budget is great even if you re not interested in fixing your credit a budget will allow you to save more money be prudent about what financial decisions you make and of course fix your credit budget out how much you can afford to spend rather than how much you d like to spend there s a difference if you set aside 200 every month for discretionary purchases a 600 flat screen tv will have to wait three months before you can pull the trigger don t pull the trigger right away and be 400 in debt for two months stick to your budget what s the good of having a budget if you don t really stick to it if you say you re going to spend 120 on groceries every week don t go over 120 it s simple to say and hard to do but it s essential for a good credit score use a credit card instead of cash to make small purchase you can afford make sure that you do not charge more than you can actually afford to pay at the end of the month some illustrative examples do use your credit card to pay for gas if your income is 2 000 per month and your gas expenses come out to 140 per month you should be able to afford to pay off 140 on your credit card every month don t use your credit card to pay for a 1 500 mattress if your monthly income is 2 000 putting a 1 500 purchase on it right away is a bad bad idea you ll be paying it off for several months and could miss a payment make more than the minimum payment you should be able to make more than the minimum payment on the card slowly working towards being able to pay it off entirely if you can t afford to make more than the minimum payment you aren t being financially responsible and have taken on too much debt stay well below your credit limit approaching 70 75 of your credit limit or maxing out your cards frequently will look dangerous and irresponsible to lenders because it often is 6 x research source credit cards are a safety net so leave a little extra room just like

fee they are not offered for free when checking your report make sure you dispute any additional accounts that aren t yours or that you didn t open dispute any reports of late payments that were in fact paid on time dispute any bankruptcies older than 10 years that are still listed as due even though you settled them in bankruptcy dispute any negative information older than 7 years spread your debt out on several different cards if possible your fico credit score will improve if you avoid one big balance on a single card and instead have several small balances on different cards this is because the fico formula looks at the difference between your balances how much you owe and your limits how much you can charge per month a low balance to limit ratio makes for better credit score than a high balance to limit ratio 8 x research source even if you pay your balance a high balance to limit ratio is not ideal if you spend 4 000 on a 5 000 limit you ve got a 8 ratio which is pretty high shoot to get a 1 ratio which means that you re spending 10 of your available limit 9 x research source don t let your credit cards go unused don t let your credit cards sit there unloved if you don t use your credit card at all your credit score will go down the credit score formula prefers to see a card that is getting regular use over a credit card that is lying fallow 10 x research source make sure your credit is attached to the major companies you want your information reported to the major credit reporting companies if possible these are the ones lenders are most likely to check so if you only have one credit card and it reports only to a small company you re in trouble this is where having more than one credit card or bank account etc can come in handy,Finance-and-Business

delinquent get an agreement in writing and be sure you fully comply with the new payment terms deal with delinquent bills paying off delinquent bills won t improve your credit score much since all

and ownership of your debts get a secured credit card secured credit cards are a great way of having a credit card without the worry the balance will get out of control you deposit money with the

cards charge high interest on the unpaid balance even though payment is fully secured as well as additional fees pay the balance each month in full each month get a secured bank loan most banks and credit unions will make secured loans to their customers borrowing money investing the proceeds in a savings account at the financial institution as security and repaying the loan in small monthly payments builds your credit history the interest paid on the savings account is likely to be 2 3 lower than the interest charged on the loan the extra interest must be made from the your other income 12 x research source do not use the savings account for any purpose except repaying the loan whenever possible make extra payments from your income to reduce the balance and build up your savings account be cautious of high debt balances as your credit score improves you ll probably start receiving offers for new credit be wary about responding to offers of credit while having a high level of credit available to you will raise your credit score using that credit a lot will lower your score ideally you should use 20 or less of your credit availability for example if you have total credit card credit of 10 000 available to you do not let the balance exceed 2000 for any lengthy period be persistent you won t see your credit score dramatically change overnight repairing your credit actually means repairing your credit history the score then reflects this 13 x research source the best things you can do now are pay your bills on time and pay down debt even then it will probably

fix any errors and determine where you need to improve 6 x research source the information on the credit report is the data used to develop the credit score so ensuring the information is correct is critical you can obtain one free credit report per year from each of the three agencies therefore you should request one report every four months so you can continually monitor your reports your credit history is free but you may have to pay a small cost to get your actual credit score some banks and credit unions offer credit score information to their customers for free 7 x research source many services that advertise that they will give you a free credit report or score are scams they will stand there between you and the credit companies in order to harvest your data and then sell the data to marketing firms you re considered to be a poor risk if you have a credit score under 620 dispute items on your credit report that are incorrect you will have better luck if you deal directly with the vendor who reported the incorrect information than depending on the credit bureaus to take your word for it for example perhaps you paid off a car loan but this was never reported to the bureaus as paid by your bank the bank should then report the correction for other types of reporting errors such as fraudulent use of your identity provide all the forms of proof that you have to the bureaus such as cancelled checks stamped invoices police reports etc put everything in writing and follow up at least once per week by phone with the bureaus until the mistakes are corrected on your report 8 x research source if you have some late payments showing on your credit report these can really hurt your score collections judgments and tax liens are devastating you can try to negotiate

is the first and most important step in improving your credit make a list of all debts and prioritize which ones to pay off first try the avalanche technique to pay your debts off as quickly as possible start by paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first continue to pay off your debts working your way down from the highest interest rates to the lowest you can also try the snowball technique with this method you pay off your smallest debt first and work your way up this is not always the most efficient way to pay off your debts in terms of saving money but the sense of accomplishment that comes with successfully paying off a debt even a small one can help motivate you to keep at it to remove the temptation retire of some of your credit cards as you pay them off too much credit can be a bad thing closing credit accounts can have a negative effect on your credit score a better solution is to pay off excess cards and stop using them without closing the account cut up the card so you won t be tempted to use it apply for a secured credit card if you are having trouble getting credit due to a poor credit score or you are a first timer apply for a secured credit card from your bank this type of card uses money in your savings account as security this is an easy way to establish a great credit history refinance loans as appropriate note that paying off loans increases your score oddly enough occasionally refinancing your mortgage and trading in cars with loans on them pays off loans too if you do refinance do it for no points and a lower rate contact the lender if you cannot make payments on time if you experience a job loss or other misfortune contact your lenders right away the worst thing you can do is ignore them explain your financial situation and agree on a new payment schedule that you can manage get the agreement in writing and ask them to include a note that your payments will not be reported as late build up different types of credit a healthy mix of different types of credit builds up your score better than simply one type for example you might have a car loan mortgage or line of credit and a credit card let s say two people have 10 000 total in total credit each and both are making timely payments one has only one credit card the other has a credit card a car payment and a bank line of credit overdraft protection the second person s score will often be much better than the first one s meet with a credit counseling agency if you need any kind of advice to help get out of debt and improve your credit history find a find a low or zero cost agency to help you there might be free services available from your employer military base credit union housing authority or a local branch of the u s cooperative extension 10 x trustworthy source united states department of justice official website of the u s department of justice go to source beware of for profit companies that charge you a fee and promise to have all or most of your debts forgiven even if they pull it off your credit score will plummet pay your bills on time regularly this is absolutely essential to better your credit score each late payment dings your credit score and presents a picture of unreliability you must determine that going forward you will be paying your bills on time the biggest chunk of your credit score is based on your payment history never bounce a check this along with late payments will stay on your credit report for seven years ask your bank for a small amount of reserve credit that will cover any insufficient funds pay at least the minimum amount due each month plus 10 make sure the payment arrives at least one day before the due date keep in mind that late medical bills and apartment rent are generally not reported to the credit bureaus although you do need a place to live it s much easier to keep track of due dates if you pay your bills online through your bank then you can schedule payments for any date even if it s not due for a few months plus you ll have written proof that the payment was made on time and you won t have to worry about delays in the mail reduce your debt to credit ratio the next big chunk of your score after your credit history is determined by the balance on your available credit seek to keep your balance for each card at approximately 30 percent of the limit or less this means that if your credit card limit is 1000 you should aim at having a balance of not more than 300 ask for an increase in your credit limit for the cards you currently have if you have used over 30 of the current limit but don t spend it having high available debt and low indebtedness helps a lot in other words if you have lots of available credit credit cards you don t use and little or manageable debt that looks better than being in hock up to your eyeballs or just having no established credit at all if you pay off your credit cards in full anyway consider paying them off a day or two before the billing cycle is closed check online or on your statement for the day and the current total that way your bill will show a very small or even negative amount which gets reported to the credit scoring institutes this increases your credit score up to 50 points if everything else is unchanged resist responding to pre approved credit card offers these come by mail or are sent to you online it s easy to think what can it hurt to apply they say i m already approved the reality is that each time one of the national credit bureaus receives an inquiry from a credit card company your score goes down a few points this includes store card accounts the less you have the better the fact that frequent checking harms your score also means that you need to avoid checking your score compulsively take advantage of 0 interest offers it can be to your advantage to transfer a current balance to a 0 interest card for a period of time sometimes as long as a year but don t close the old account your credit history looks better to the credit bureaus if you have long standing established accounts this looks good even if many of your accounts are never used anymore taking advantage of these 0 offers outweighs the disadvantage of the credit card company making an inquiry to the credit bureaus be stable there are several ways to impress the stability of your life on a credit score reviewer while these may seem less important than other factors it all helps to raise your score buy your own home owning a home is viewed as considerably better than renting one although affordability of housing has changed in recent years owning a home is still within the reach of many who save regularly and spend within their means avoid moving around a lot if you physically reside at the same address for a long time it is better for your credit history than if you move frequently get married if you examine two people with very similar credit histories the one who is married will have a markedly higher credit score than the single person strange but true age is another personal characteristic that the credit bureaus factor into their ratings older is better even though you cannot magically increase your age it is nice to know that as time goes by your credit score automatically improves,Finance-and-Business

sucked into spending lots of money just because you have a high limit your limit is something you should be afraid of not mesmerized by you should never charge your card for the limit unless it s an emergency know about monthly payments if you don t use your credit card during a month you won t have to make payments on it but if you do use your credit card you ll have three options of how to pay back the money you can pay the balance in full you can pay an amount smaller than the balance or you can pay the monthly minimum the monthly minimum is the amount that you re forced to pay or you ll be dinged with a late payment only paying the monthly minimum will make your credit score worse know that you can pay interest on your credit card interest is a small fee that the lender charges you for the privilege of borrowing money high interest rates are bad if your credit card comes with a 10 interest rate and you charge your card for 500 you could be hit with 50 in interest charges and still have to pay back 500 you got 500 but you had to pay 550 that s not a great deal usually if you don t pay your full balance your interest rate payments will start kicking in on the amount that you haven t paid so if your balance is 500 and you pay off 250 check your interest rate if your yearly interest rate is 12 you re going to pay 1 each month 500 250 250 x 01 2 5 for that month look for

cards and only use one regularly there are advantages and disadvantages to this strategy advantage your total credit limit goes up if you have one card with a limit of 600 your total credit limit is

how to establish credit,to people without much financial experience credit can seem a lot like a catch 22 to get it you must already have it while it s true that having a credit history is a prerequisite for many of life s major financial transactions like for instance buying a house with the right approach you can establish healthy credit from almost nothing over a few years by starting small and gradually increasing your credit all while making responsible financial decisions you can establish a good credit history that will be able to serve as a strong financial foundation for years to come,sign up for a secured credit card for someone who s looking to establish credit from an absolute blank slate or start repairing a bad credit history a secured credit card is generally the best bet these credit cards which are available from most local banks and credit unions work basically the same way as a collateral secured loan you give the credit issuer a certain amount of money and in turn the credit issuer gives you a line of credit that you can spend as you please because these sorts of credit cards essentially come with a security deposit they re often some of the easiest credit cards to get the credit issuer isn t worried that it won t get its money back because you ve already given them collateral your credit issuer may still ask for evidence of your financial history when you apply for a secured card even if you ve never had a line of credit before you can still make a case for yourself as a responsible candidate by presenting evidence that you ve been prompt about paying off your major expenses for example if you ve been making utility rent or car payments showing the bank your receipts or cancelled checks used to make the payments can demonstrate that you ve been meeting your responsibilities 1 x research source make small manageable purchases with your line of credit to get a good credit history you need to use your credit once you have your new secured credit card start using it to make small purchases like groceries meals movie tickets and so on track your spending carefully and never let it get out of hand a good rule of thumb is not to spend any more than about half of your credit line at any one time however most financial commentators will agree that less than 30 is even better 2 x research source having lots of outstanding debt can impact your credit score even if you re eventually able to pay it back once you start getting the bills for your credit card pay each one off in full as soon as you can by doing this you re establishing a history of prompt repayment future credit issuers love this it proves that you re reliable about paying your bills back and that you don t typically spend more than you can afford obtain an unsecured credit card after a time period of responsibly spending and paying back your bills with a secured line of credit you may be able to qualify for an unsecured ordinary credit card sign up for one of these cards at the same bank that issued your secured card and start using it to make small responsible purchases just as you ve been doing with your other card these credit cards are slightly more risky for banks to loan because they don t require you to put down collateral which means that there s a chance that they won t get their money back thus it s in their interest to give these cards only to people who they trust to be smart with their money since you now have a demonstrated history of paying back your debt it should be easier for you to get an unsecured card although the credit limit may be low initially obtain one or two store credit cards from local businesses banks aren t the only entities that can issue credit a wide variety of businesses for instance department stores airlines gas petrol companies and many more issue their own credit cards often these store cards come with a special one time signing bonus like 10 off your purchase or the ability to earn rewards points towards in store credit if a business that you frequently use issues credit cards consider signing up for one when you make a major purchase as these cards count towards your credit history just like bank issued cards you ll generally want to avoid signing up for more than just a few store credit cards however having many different credit card bills to pay raises the risk that you ll eventually forget one plus opening many lines of credit can sometimes damage your credit reputation pay down all debts as quickly as possible once you have multiple lines of credit you ll want to continue with your habit of paying off your debts as quickly as possible if you can pay off your credit card bills as soon as you get them or by the due date if for any reason you can t afford to completely pay off your debt one month pay as much as you reasonably can this will help you avoid the long term expenses of interest payments on credit card debt which compared to basic personal loans are usually high 3 x research source try to avoid the dangerous situation of amassing so much credit debt that you can only afford to make the minimum payment each month this will cost you lots of money in interest payments in the long term and will usually hurt your credit score in this case you may be in need of credit counseling services see part 2 for more information make a big purchase with store dealer financing being able to make a major purchase like a car or a refrigerator with one lump payment upfront is very convenient but in doing this you may rob yourself of a great opportunity to boost your credit score instead try opting for a store financing plan most stores that sell high priced products will allow you the option to pay them off over time rather than pay the entire cost up front keep the money you would have used to make the lump sum purchase separate from your normal funds so that you ll still have enough to make the entire purchase when the time comes when you get the first monthly bill pay off the entire cost of the product since this sort of financing plan is technically a loan paying it off immediately looks great on your credit history 4 x research source paying off your purchase immediately also keeps you safe from interest charges many sellers will have a special interest free repayment window at the start of the loan often 90 days make all payments on your credit cards on time perhaps the single most important thing you can do to establish good credit is to make a point to pay back all your credit card bills by their due dates this is a great way to build your credit in the long term on the other hand missing payments or frequently opting to make only the minimum payment on your debt makes it appear as if you can t afford to maintain your current level of debt which will make it difficult to get more credit in the future don t let any of your other bills go delinquent it s important to remember that it s not just your credit card bills that you ll need to pay on time ordinary expenses like rent utilities car payments and so on are also important to your credit score some vendors that you pay for these expenses don t regularly report your credit activity to credit agencies however if one of your bills becomes delinquent they usually will report this 5 x research source thus while paying your monthly expenses on

information don t confuse credit cards with debit cards though they look almost identical and can both be issued by banks credit cards and debit cards are two entirely different things debit cards don t operate on credit in other words when you make a purchase with a debit card the money comes directly out of your checking account as if you ve written a check for the purchase no credit issuer is loaning you the money you re paying with money that you already have for this reason you can t usually use a debit card to build credit unless your card has the optional feature to be used as a credit card don t take out a bank loan to establish credit if you stay on top of your credit card bills credit cards are usually an easier and smarter way to build credit than personal loans while paying off a loan on time is good for your credit it s usually a waste of money to use it solely for this purpose loans require you to pay interest on the other hand it s usually possible to pay credit cards off in full without incurring interest if you use the earliest available repayment schedule 8 x research source thus as long as you keep up your habit of paying off your credit card bills as quickly as possible there s no real incentive to take out a loan for the purpose of building credit for major purchases however like homes and cars loans are unavoidable as you can t typically charge these sorts of purchases to credit cards in these cases simply pay back your loan as quickly as possible to minimize the amount of interest you pay don t open more lines of credit than you need having a few manageable lines of credit is a good thing having many lines of credit can be a very bad thing as noted above the more lines of credit you have the harder it is to keep track of your payments worse still if you get behind on your payments and get into the deadly habit of using one card to pay off another you may quickly find yourself in a financial death spiral that s very hard to get out of for these reasons many credit agencies consider opening many lines of credit to be a warning sign for risky financial behavior so this may cause a dip in your credit scores don t get hooked into a credit repair scam while there are an abundance of fair ethical credit counseling agencies available some bad apples exist to take advantage of customers who are in dire financial straits these agencies may promise a clean slate or an easy way out of credit troubles but instead use exploitative and even illegal practices to profit from your situation all while pushing you even deeper into debt as a very general rule if any sort of credit service seems miraculous or too good to be true it s probably best not to trust it here are a few common danger signs to be on the lookout for consult the website of

overall amount of credit you have available even though it remains the same amount credit card companies are typically more inclined to give you a higher limit if you have a good credit score and a good payment history with them but even if you don t they still may be willing to work with you negotiate a lower interest rate on accounts you ve had for a while if you ve had a credit card for several years and have a good relationship with the credit card company you may be able to get a lower interest rate if you re carrying a balance on the card this can keep you from getting further

payment can be enough to drop your score a few points so it s important to pay all your bills early or on time every time about 30 of your score is based on your credit utilization which looks at the amount of outstanding debt you have relative to the credit you have available if you have to carry a balance on a credit card make sure it s not more than 25 or 30 of your total available credit about 15 of your credit score is based on your credit history to keep this portion of your credit score sound avoid closing your oldest accounts inquiries make up about 10 of your credit score try not to apply for more than 2 or 3 new lines of credit per year to avoid a negative impact on your score the final 10 of your credit score deals with the different types of credit accounts you have ideally you want a mix of credit cards auto loans a mortgage and other types of installment accounts create a monthly budget and stick to it all the hard work you put into fixing your credit will go to waste if you end up getting yourself in debt again because you re over extended figure out your actual take home income each month and subtract from that the bills you have no control over such as your utilities rent or mortgage payment food and transportation costs 11 x research source if you find that you have a shortfall each month see what you can do to cut your expenses for example you may be able to buy in bulk and share with friends and family to reduce food costs getting a side gig is another option if you find you have repeated difficulty making ends meet signing up with a ride share

it can be tempting to plunk down a credit card if you want to buy a new tv gaming system or computer but even though your monthly payments may be relatively low you ll pay a lot more for that item in interest especially if it takes you several years to pay down the balance 12 x research source for example suppose you see a new computer that you want for 3 000 you could put it on your credit card and pay the minimum payment of 60 a month however if your interest rate is 15 this will end up costing you an additional 400 or so a year even worse if you only make the minimum payment it ll take you 16 years to pay it off by then the computer would be well past obsolete and you would have paid your credit card company 3 641 in interest more than the initial purchase price of the computer pay your bills on time and in full create a bill calendar and write down each bill on the day that it s due this can help you keep track of your bills so they don t sneak up on you you can also set reminders on your computer or smartphone try to pay your credit card balances in full every month whenever possible 13 x research source setting up autopay can be a good option to ensure that you don t miss a

how to maintain your credit score in retirement,many people who retire may think that their credit score becomes less important after all the house and car may be paid off and there may be no more large bills on the horizon even so maintaining a good credit score is important you can keep your credit score strong even with a reduced or fixed income by handling your credit accounts carefully continue to monitor your credit reports annually to watch for identify theft and to ensure accuracy,pay your credit card bills on time whether your earnings decrease with retirement or not you remain responsible for making your payments on time the credit agencies which include both the credit card companies and the credit score reporting agencies are less concerned with your income than with your ability to make your payments making your payments on time is the key regardless of your income level 1 x research source keep the credit balance low compared to the credit limit with decreased income in retirement you may be tempted to use credit cards more this is fine if you make your full payments each month however if you let the credit balance creep up you will reduce your overall credit score carrying a minimal balance will not hurt you much credit agencies measure the ratio of your outstanding credit debt as compared to the amount of credit that you have available to you carrying a debt of 2 000 is less damaging if your total credit line is 25 000 for example than if your credit line is only 5 000 watch the balance and keep your ratio down as much as possible 2 x research source you should try to keep the ratio to 25 or less thus a 2 000 debt with 25 000 available credit is only 8 which is strong but 2 000 debt with only a 5 000 limit is a ratio of 40 which is going to hurt your credit score keep credit accounts open you may find that you need less credit as you enter retirement because you are buying less and your monthly expenses are lower this may tempt you to close one or more credit card accounts that you might not be using don t keeping established credit card accounts open serves two good purposes that will help your overall credit score 3 x research source first your credit score is positively affected by the age on your accounts an older account that you have had continuously for many years carries good positive weight and helps boost your credit score second keeping accounts open increases the amount of available credit that you have as a result the ratio of borrowing to credit is lower and this helps increase your credit score for example if you owe 2 000 with total available credit of 20 000 the ratio is one tenth however if you shut down an account you may still owe the same 2 000 but only have available credit of 10 000 this ratio is one fifth and scores less for your credit report continue using your credit cards your credit score is affected not only by the credit that you have but also by your ongoing good use of credit you should make a habit of using your credit cards at least for modest expenses each month then pay those bills on time and in full at the end of the month this kind of practice will show that you can handle the credit cards and that you continue to be a good credit risk the amount of your purchases is not as important as the fact that you continue using and paying off the credit cards 4 x research source request credit limit increases periodically you should ask your lender if you qualify for an increase in your credit limit especially if you have built up a good credit history by making payments on time this request should be granted you should continue to request this every few years even as you enter retirement if you believe you would qualify the credit limit increase will help you keep a low debt to credit ratio and keep your credit score high check your credit reports annually you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report each year from each of the three major credit reporting agencies you should make a practice of requesting this report each year review it carefully and compare it with the report from the year before if you notice that the score has decreased you should try to identify the reason and make any necessary corrections 5 x research source you can reach the three reporting agencies to request your score and free report as follows transunion www transunion com or 877 322 8228 6 x research source experian www experian com or 888 397 3742 7 x research source equifax www equifax com or 800 685 1111 alternatively new companies like creditkarma com offer free checks of your credit score question any inaccuracies when you review your credit report you should look for any suspicious activity if you see any reported accounts or purchases that you think are inaccurate you should contact the reporting agency right away their websites contain multiple options for you to contact customer service either by phone mail or email 8 x research source when you call you should have your copy of the credit report with you circle or highlight the questionable items you want to discuss keep a pad of paper with you and take notes of the phone call get the name and contact number of the person you speak with take careful notes of any recommendations or suggestions find out what the agency says it will do to investigate your concern ask how long it will take follow up again by phone or in writing if that time passes and you have not heard anything back from them avoid credit inquiries each time you apply for credit the lender must check your credit report each check like that registers as a mark against your credit score obviously if you need the credit and know what you are doing then go ahead but do not apply haphazardly for credit accounts as too many inquiries can damage your overall credit score 9 x research source when you monitor your annual credit report you should see a report of all credit inquiries if you see inquiries that you do not recognize as requests that you initiated you should ask the credit agency to investigate if the inquiry cannot be verified as one that you initiated you can have it removed to improve your credit score work with a reliable financial advisor a good financial advisor can help you manage your life s savings to make the most use of your money in retirement ideally you may have begun working with a financial planner long before retiring if not it is never too late to start a good advisor can help you plan investments set budgets and use your money wisely to find a good financial advisor ask your friends or colleagues for recommendations you may ask the manager of your own bank for referrals as well in many cases your local bank may offer the services you need meet with prospective advisors and ask some of the following questions do you specialize in retirement planning or management how do you charge for your services what is your investment strategy for someone in my position how much communication can we expect with you set a budget for monthly expenses either on your own or with the help of a financial planner it is important to know your financial situation from month to month you need to set a budget that accounts for all your monthly expenses and identifies the sources of income you may have finished paying the mortgage but you might still have car payments you certainly will need to make payments for utilities food and other ongoing costs be thorough and list everything 10 x research source compare your monthly expenses with whatever sources of income you can count on consider whether you will draw from a pension account from savings or from any other sources you may have available reduce your monthly expenses many people find that retirement means reduced income in order to handle that and keep up a good credit score you may find that you need to reduce your monthly expenses some of this may be easy like cooking at home more often and reducing entertainment expenses some other reductions may be more challenging to accept but can have very meaningful and positive effects on your spending for example consider the following 11 x research source cut back on an extra car if you and your spouse have been using two cars you may want to consider cutting back to one this will reduce monthly insurance bills gasoline costs and excise taxes not to mention car payments if you are still making them examine your insurance costs many retirees find that they may be carrying more insurance than they still need for example if your dependents are no longer relying on your income you may be able to drop or reduce life insurance or disability insurance you may also be able to reduce your car insurance by accepting higher deductible payments downsize your home this may be an emotionally difficult decision if you have spent most of your life in one home but if you no longer need the space because your children have grown and moved out you can probably reduce property taxes heating and utility costs ongoing maintenance and care and other expenses related to keeping up a big home reduce telephone costs many retirees find that they are keeping the telephone land line that has been in place forever even though you may primarily be using a cell phone now if you can drop the land line you may save up to 50 each month in fees increase your income as needed if you set your monthly budget and you find that your retirement income is insufficient to meet your monthly needs you may want to consider taking on some part time work if you look around there are many jobs that are well suited to seniors with flexible hours and decent pay find something that fits your skill set for example aarp recommends the following as great part time jobs for retirees 12 x research source library assistant bookkeeper personal and home care aide handyman medical assistant,Finance-and-Business

responsible with the new credit accounts in fact a wise suggestion is to not even use the new credit you have or only use it once a month for a small amount just to show positive repayment history decide if you need to create new tradelines if you already have good credit from a variety of different credit sources and a good history of paying off that debt chances are you don t need to add additional tradelines the important thing is to strive for quality over quantity you want several different lines of credit like a credit card or two and a mortgage payment that you ve paid consistently for years in addition be sure to stay well below the limit on your credit cards it won t hurt you to add more tradelines if you re careful with them but after a certain point adding more

score and feel like you can responsibly manage more credit consider applying for an additional credit card or a line of credit generally speaking try to apply for a type of credit you do not have if you already have a credit card consider applying for a line of credit this shows creditors you can handle different types of credit 3 x research source if you are unable to obtain approval for these types of products consider using a co signer a co signer is a friend relative or other individual who is willing to agree to pay the loan if you cannot this can help gain approval remember that if you

to add you to their account this is a commonly recommended and handy way to add tradelines to your credit account with very low risk quite simply credit accounts can often have more than one authorized user if you ask someone you have a trusting relationship with to add you to their account as an authorized user the tradeline will be added to your credit report this means you can benefit from the other person s positive repayment history on the other hand you can also do major damage to the other persons credit history and they can in turn do damage to yours to correct this ask to be added as an authorized user but be given no access to the accounts this means you will not receive a card or any other means to spend with at the same time make sure the person who authorizes you has
