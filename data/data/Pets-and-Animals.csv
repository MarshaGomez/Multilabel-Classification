how to train a pig,because pigs are highly intelligent and easily motivated by food and affection they re surprisingly easy to train although pigs aren t the right pets for everyone as a responsible pig owner you can establish good behaviors early on with commands like no stay come and leave it you can also house train your pig so it uses a litter box and walks on a leash with some healthy treats and patience your pig will be trying to impress you with its mastery of new tricks like spin sit and shake,start training your pig as early as possible if you begin training your pig when it s very young or as soon as you get it you ll be able to establish good behaviors you will keep your pig mentally stimulated and engaged while nurturing a bond between you and your pig 1 x research source pigs like hierarchical relationships by training a young piglet you can establish yourself as the leader of the herd 2 x research source train your pig every day like other intelligent animals pigs become destructive when they re bored prevent boredom from setting in with a consistent routine that your pig can anticipate 3 x research source it is in a pig s nature to investigate and forage 4 x research source balance your training regime with other free time activities that allow your pig to safely explore set a specific time each day to train your pig plan to implement your training program during specific times of the day observe your pig s habits to learn which times of day it has the highest levels of focus and patience also consider training your pig just before bedtime to use up the last bursts of mental and physical energy for a good night s sleep 5 x research source pigs function well with routines so if you stick to this schedule you ll help your pig thrive avoid training your pig around mealtimes generally when your pig is hungry and impatient it won t be motivated to practice tricks and commands you might even provoke it to become aggressive prioritize giving your pig a healthy balanced diet and plenty of fresh water over rehearsing tricks early on you can teach your pig the come command and use the meal as the reward when it comes over to you 6 x research source eventually though this command can be detached from mealtime only once your pig has mastered other commands and tricks like stay and sit should you practice these around mealtimes stock your pantry with pig friendly treats pigs are highly motivated by food rewards which helps during the training process gather treats to use only during your training session prepare fresh fruits like chopped apples and halved grapes or stock up on cereals like shredded wheat and cheerios plain popcorn is another great option as long as it s not salted or buttered 7 x research source keep the treat servings small to prevent unnecessary weight gain 8 x research source follow up each treat with positive reinforcement each time you deliver a reward show your pig some affection say things like good boy girl or your pig s name while petting and scratching its favorite spots pigs tend to bond with their humans so providing lots of attention and affection can help make your pig eager to participate 9 x research source you can also use a clicker during your training along with treats and affection 10 x research source provide a suitably sized litter box for your pig the litter box should be large enough for your pig to stand at least the back half of its body in it should also be shallow enough to accommodate a pig s limited range of leg motion 11 x research source cut out a low entryway to the litter box if your piglet is very small fill the box with pine shavings line the base of the litter box with paper towels for added traction your pig might slip on smooth plastic then fill the litter box with pine shavings pine pellets or newspaper pellets avoid clumping litter like most cat litters since pigs will attempt to eat the clumps refrain from using cedar shavings or walnut litter as they will irritate your pig 12 x research source if your pig has used a litter box before ask the previous owner or breeder what variety they used you should use the same for consistency place the litter box in a confined area use a playpen a large crate or a small enclosed room such as a mudroom or bathroom for potty training since pigs prefer to be clean and sanitary this should be a separate space from where they sleep and eat 13 x research source avoid letting your pig roam freely until it s mastered the use of the litter box and knows how to find it once your pig is house trained consider spreading multiple litter boxes around your space so it doesn t have to wander very far place your pig in the litter box every few hours and say a potty command place it directly in the box every 1 or 2 hours say a command such as go potty or bathroom whenever your pig uses the litter box correctly offer it lots of praise in time your pig will know to go directly to the litter box when it needs to relieve itself piglets have very limited control over their bladders so place yours in the litter box as soon as it wakes up and immediately following each meal drink of water training session and play session and right before bedtime refrain from rewarding litter box usage with treats since your pig might try to trick you into getting a treat 14 x research source say the no command with a raised hand when your pig attempts a prohibited activity sternly say no make sure you re positioned so that your pig can see you and raise your hand like a stop sign or point your finger towards the pig while you say the command 15 x research source repeat this command only when your pig demonstrates negative behaviors and contrast the no command with positive reinforcement of good behaviors eventually your pig may stop what it s doing upon seeing just your hand gesture hold out a treat and teach your pig the come command this is one of the few commands you should teach around mealtime while holding a meal or treat close to your body say the command come before giving the food to your pig after a few weeks of regular mealtime practice or once your pig has mastered this command at mealtimes get a treat and say come when your pig is a little farther away keep increasing the distance and your pig will learn to come to your side upon command 16 x research source once your pig has a handle on this command gradually decrease the number of treats you provide you ll find it to be useful in many situations beyond mealtime but keep rewarding your pig with affection and positive reinforcement 17 x research source urge your pig to walk backward for the leave it command when your pig wanders into an off limits area or towards an off limits item you can use the command leave it back or out stand in front of the pig and slowly walk towards it until it begins to walk backward or away from you repeat the command with every step the pig takes in the right direction then reward it with a treat and some affection when it has completely left the off limits area 18 x research source you can also motion your hands in front of your body to shoo the pig backward but make sure you exhibit a positive energy and give positive reinforcement don t scare the pig away pigs are relatively stubborn so this command might take a while for yours to learn even once it knows the command it might not follow immediately expect to repeat this command regularly use a hand gesture along with the stay command select a hand gesture for the stay or wait command you can use a raised palm or pointed finger whichever you re not using for the no command say the command with the hand gesture and wait a few moments while your pig stays still then deliver a reward and praise 19 x research source over time stand farther away and even back up while repeating the command but make sure you go directly to your pig to deliver the reward this way your pig will learn that it doesn t need to go to you to get the treat since you will go to it teach your pig the spin trick by rotating a treat around its body pick a command to use with this trick it can be spin or dance or you can say left and right to teach your pig to turn in different directions 20 x research source hold a treat out in front of your pig s snout and then rotate it in a wide circle to encourage the pig to rotate its body once the treat and the pig have completed a full rotation deliver the reward 21 x research source since this action doesn t require any challenging movements or body adjustments it can be a great first trick to teach your pig your pig is likely to pick up this trick quickly or within just a few weeks once it understands the premise of the trick remove the treat but continue gesturing with your hand deliver a treat at the end of the circle gradually transition to offering just positive reinforcement eventually your pig should be able to spin on your verbal command without a hand gesture or a food carrot leading it around it might even start spinning on the spot without your command in anticipation of a treat in these instances deliver positive reinforcement to praise your well trained pig but refrain from offering a treat hold a treat in the air to encourage your pig to do the sit trick when standing pigs can t lift up their heads to look up like other animals can if you hold up a treat above its head it will have to sit down to adjust its perspective 22 x research source hold a treat out in front of the pig s snout and slowly raise it above its head say the word sit as you do this then as soon as the pig s bottom hits the floor deliver the reward 23 x research source refrain from pushing the pig s body down to get it to sit sitting is not an easy natural position for pigs at first it will be focused on the food not what its body is doing after weeks or even months of practice it will associate the movement with the sit command practice sit training on carpeting or grass your pig s hooves might slip on smoother surfaces try practicing this trick against a wall so that your pig doesn t just walk backward 24 x research source gently encourage your pig to lift its hoof for the shake trick while sitting in front of your pig gently tap on the back of its front leg while saying the shake command once your pig has become comfortable with this contact lightly lift your pig s hoof off the ground when you say shake keep repeating this process and soon enough your pig will anticipate the leg lift 25 x research source once your pig has mastered shake after a few weeks it might be ready for wave say the shake command without positioning your hand near its hoof if the pig lifts its hoof reward this behavior and introduce the wave command 26 x research source getting your pig comfortable with having its hooves touched will be helpful when it comes time for you or a vet to trim them,Pets-and-Animals

how to brush matted fur,matted fur can be really uncomfortable for an animal the tangles pull on the animal s skin which can lead to irritation and even infections luckily in some cases you may be able to remove the mat yourself try gently combing through the mat using a detangler if necessary if that doesn t work you may need to carefully cut the mat away of course if you have any hesitation or concerns bring the animal to a veterinarian or a professional groomer to get it checked out,try combing the mat first if you can work your fingers into it press the mat between your thumb and first finger or your first 2 fingers if the mat is very large if the matted fur separates beneath your fingers or your finger and thumb touch through the fur you may be able to use a comb to gently detangle the mat 1 x research source typically the earlier you can catch a mat the easier it will be to detangle that s why you should examine your pet s coat daily especially if the animal has long hair that s prone to tangling if the fur is matted together to the point that it feels hard trying to detangle it may cause unnecessary pain or stress to the animal and it could even cause it to become aggressive cut the mat if the fur is matted tightly but it s not against the animal s skin even if the mat is too serious to detangle with a comb you may still be able to remove it yourself if you can work your fingers beneath the mat and clearly feel that there s a separation between the tangled fur and the skin you may be able to safely cut the mat away 2 x research source if you have any question about whether it s safe to cut the mat take the animal to a vet or a professional groomer call a professional groomer if the mat is tight against the skin 3 x expert source lancy woo certified pet groomer expert interview 26 february 2020 sometimes when fur gets really matted it can press tightly against the animal s skin folds of skin can even become trapped in the mat which can lead to a severe laceration if you try to cut it away 4 x trustworthy source american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty go to source you should also call a professional groomer if the mat is somewhere very sensitive like on the abdomen under the neck or around the genitals or if the animal is scared or aggressive cats in particular can be very skittish when you re working around their abdomen even if they re normally very tame a scared cat might curl around your hand kicking with its back feet and gripping you with its front claws as it tries to bite you a professional will know how to avoid these dangerous situations 5 x research source see your vet if there is any irritation on the skin under the mat if you notice any redness inflammation or broken skin beneath the mat the problem might be too serious for even a professional groomer instead have the animal examined by a vet and ask them how to proceed 6 x research source serious issues including irritation and infection can occur when a mat sits against an animal s skin for a long period of time don t wash the animal before you try to remove any mats when you see an animal with dirty matted fur it might be tempting to give it a good bath right away however if you wash the animal before you detangle its fur the mats will tighten up as they dry which will make them even harder to remove 7 x research source in addition the mats might prevent the soapy water from penetrating the fur all the way to the skin making the bath ineffective if you re detangling dog hair you may want to bathe the dog after you detangle its fur however avoid bathing a cat unless its fur is greasy or smelly they typically groom themselves and you ll just stress it out 8 x research source if the mat is in a horse s mane you can use a special horse shampoo to wash its mane after you finish detangling it use your fingers to break up any tangles and mats as much as possible place the animal on a towel on the ground or a sturdy table and sit or stand close by run your fingers over the animal s fur breaking up as many mats and tangles as you can by hand separate loose hairs from the mats and gently work out any knots you can but don t pull or tear at the animal s fur detangling mats can be a long process and it can be stressful on the animal especially if you re yanking with a comb the whole time using your fingers can help soothe the animal and will decrease the amount of time you spend pulling on the mat try petting the animal as you detangle its fur to help calm it down for instance if you re detangling a mat on a cat s side reach up every so often and stroke the cat s cheeks or chin that way it will associate the grooming with positive attention break apart larger mats with a comb working from the outside in 9 x expert source lancy woo certified pet groomer expert interview 26 february 2020 if you come across a mat that you can t detangle by hand you ll likely need to break it up with a wide toothed metal comb a brush is not as effective at removing mats because it won t penetrate the fur as deeply grip the mat securely with one hand as close to the skin as you can get then try to pick apart the mat with the widest end of your comb using short gentle strokes start at the end of the mat furthest from the animal s skin and work your way inward 10 x research source do not yank on the mat as this is likely to upset the animal also avoid raking the comb directly across the animal s skin as this could cause irritation over time this part of the process takes time and patience work in small sections and if the animal starts getting frustrated take a break if it creates a negative association with the grooming process you ll have a harder time keeping the mats from coming back if you re detangling the fur on a treat motivated animal like a dog cat or horse offer it treats and plenty of soft soothing praise if it s acting calm and relaxed saturate a stubborn mat with a detangling product for that specific animal 11 x expert source lancy woo certified pet groomer expert interview 26 february 2020 deep conditioning products contain oils that can help the animal s fur slip out of the mat if a mat is too tangled to comb out soak it with a detangler and let it soak in for about 30 minutes then come back and try to break the mat apart with your fingers or comb it apart 12 x research source because animals have different skin phs you should never use products intended for another animal for example you shouldn t use a conditioner for a horse s mane on a dog however you may find some detanglers that are intended for both cats and dogs if that s the case it should clearly say so on the label also never use human skin or hair care products on an animal 13 x research source go back over the area with a fine comb or brush once you remove the mat many combs for animal grooming have a wider side and a fine tooth side if that s the case comb back through the animal s fur with the finer side once you ve gotten most of the mat free this will help you catch any smaller tangles that might be left behind 14 x research source if your comb is only one width use a smaller fine tooth metal comb or go over the area with the animal s normal brush for example you might use a small slicker brush on a long haired cat or a bristle brush for a dog with a medium coat use a razor comb to try to cut out the mat first a razor comb which may also be called a rake tool or a mat splitting tool looks like a wide comb with long sharp teeth 15 x expert source lancy woo certified pet groomer expert interview 26 february 2020 press your hand against the animal s skin to help reduce pulling then work the teeth of the razor comb under the mat and gently pull down in the direction the hair grows don t yank just allow the tool to gently slice through the matted fur as far as it will go it may take several passes to cut through the hair holding the mat in place 16 x research source doing this will remove smaller mats but it may also help loosen the tension on larger mats helping the animal be more comfortable as you continue you can find these tools at most pet supply stores choose a size that s best for your animal for instance you would want a smaller razor comb for cats and small dogs and a larger tool for larger dogs this tool is very sharp so always use caution when you re using it also be sure to always have the sharp ends pointing upward away from the animal s skin similarly don t apply too much pressure on the tool as it s easy to accidentally rake the skin and cause injury take special care around angled areas like the legs and tail cut out large stubborn mats with hair clippers use your hand to pull the animal s skin as flat and tight as you can around the mat then turn on the clippers and lightly run them over the very surface of the mat moving in the direction that the fur is growing if you need to you can make several passes gently running the clippers over the surface of the mat each time however don t clip all the way to the animal s skin just stop once you ve removed the bulk of the mat 17 x research source before you try to use clippers make sure the animal is stable and calm and have someone else hold it still if you can speak to the animal in a soothing voice to reassure it throughout the process and stop if it gets agitated if you re grooming a cat it may help to have someone gently hold it by the scruff of its neck this can actually help calm a cat since it s the way mother cats carry kittens when they re young 18 x research source if the animal is so matted that it needs to be completely shaved take it to a professional groomer however if your cat typically experiences a lot of stress during grooming it may be best to take your cat to the vet who can sedate your cat during the removal process not only will this make your cat more comfortable and stress free it will also prevent your cat from becoming more fearful of grooming in the future check the clippers every minute or so to make sure they aren t too hot clippers can get really hot which can burn the animal if you re not careful about every 60 seconds turn off the clippers and lightly touch your hand to the blade if it s uncomfortably hot to the touch it s too hot for the animal wait a few minutes for the clippers to cool down before you turn them on again 19 x research source you can also use a cooling spray designed for clippers to help keep the blade from overheating try to detangle the fur with a comb once you ve removed most of the mat often removing the outer surface of a mat will help loosen it enough that you can finish the detangling process with your fingers or a wide tooth comb if you still can t loosen the mat clip away a little more fur or call a professional if you re concerned you need to clip too close to the skin 20 x research source a detangling spray may also be useful after you ve removed the bulk of the mat saturate the animal s fur with the spray and let it sit for about 30 minutes or the amount of time recommended on the product label then gently comb the animal s fur to loosen any remaining tangles,Pets-and-Animals

how to train a pig,because pigs are highly intelligent and easily motivated by food and affection they re surprisingly easy to train although pigs aren t the right pets for everyone as a responsible pig owner you can establish good behaviors early on with commands like no stay come and leave it you can also house train your pig so it uses a litter box and walks on a leash with some healthy treats and patience your pig will be trying to impress you with its mastery of new tricks like spin sit and shake,start training your pig as early as possible if you begin training your pig when it s very young or as soon as you get it you ll be able to establish good behaviors you will keep your pig mentally stimulated and engaged while nurturing a bond between you and your pig 1 x research source pigs like hierarchical relationships by training a young piglet you can establish yourself as the leader of the herd 2 x research source train your pig every day like other intelligent animals pigs become destructive when they re bored prevent boredom from setting in with a consistent routine that your pig can anticipate 3 x research source it is in a pig s nature to investigate and forage 4 x research source balance your training regime with other free time activities that allow your pig to safely explore set a specific time each day to train your pig plan to implement your training program during specific times of the day observe your pig s habits to learn which times of day it has the highest levels of focus and patience also consider training your pig just before bedtime to use up the last bursts of mental and physical energy for a good night s sleep 5 x research source pigs function well with routines so if you stick to this schedule you ll help your pig thrive avoid training your pig around mealtimes generally when your pig is hungry and impatient it won t be motivated to practice tricks and commands you might even provoke it to become aggressive prioritize giving your pig a healthy balanced diet and plenty of fresh water over rehearsing tricks early on you can teach your pig the come command and use the meal as the reward when it comes over to you 6 x research source eventually though this command can be detached from mealtime only once your pig has mastered other commands and tricks like stay and sit should you practice these around mealtimes stock your pantry with pig friendly treats pigs are highly motivated by food rewards which helps during the training process gather treats to use only during your training session prepare fresh fruits like chopped apples and halved grapes or stock up on cereals like shredded wheat and cheerios plain popcorn is another great option as long as it s not salted or buttered 7 x research source keep the treat servings small to prevent unnecessary weight gain 8 x research source follow up each treat with positive reinforcement each time you deliver a reward show your pig some affection say things like good boy girl or your pig s name while petting and scratching its favorite spots pigs tend to bond with their humans so providing lots of attention and affection can help make your pig eager to participate 9 x research source you can also use a clicker during your training along with treats and affection 10 x research source provide a suitably sized litter box for your pig the litter box should be large enough for your pig to stand at least the back half of its body in it should also be shallow enough to accommodate a pig s limited range of leg motion 11 x research source cut out a low entryway to the litter box if your piglet is very small fill the box with pine shavings line the base of the litter box with paper towels for added traction your pig might slip on smooth plastic then fill the litter box with pine shavings pine pellets or newspaper pellets avoid clumping litter like most cat litters since pigs will attempt to eat the clumps refrain from using cedar shavings or walnut litter as they will irritate your pig 12 x research source if your pig has used a litter box before ask the previous owner or breeder what variety they used you should use the same for consistency place the litter box in a confined area use a playpen a large crate or a small enclosed room such as a mudroom or bathroom for potty training since pigs prefer to be clean and sanitary this should be a separate space from where they sleep and eat 13 x research source avoid letting your pig roam freely until it s mastered the use of the litter box and knows how to find it once your pig is house trained consider spreading multiple litter boxes around your space so it doesn t have to wander very far place your pig in the litter box every few hours and say a potty command place it directly in the box every 1 or 2 hours say a command such as go potty or bathroom whenever your pig uses the litter box correctly offer it lots of praise in time your pig will know to go directly to the litter box when it needs to relieve itself piglets have very limited control over their bladders so place yours in the litter box as soon as it wakes up and immediately following each meal drink of water training session and play session and right before bedtime refrain from rewarding litter box usage with treats since your pig might try to trick you into getting a treat 14 x research source say the no command with a raised hand when your pig attempts a prohibited activity sternly say no make sure you re positioned so that your pig can see you and raise your hand like a stop sign or point your finger towards the pig while you say the command 15 x research source repeat this command only when your pig demonstrates negative behaviors and contrast the no command with positive reinforcement of good behaviors eventually your pig may stop what it s doing upon seeing just your hand gesture hold out a treat and teach your pig the come command this is one of the few commands you should teach around mealtime while holding a meal or treat close to your body say the command come before giving the food to your pig after a few weeks of regular mealtime practice or once your pig has mastered this command at mealtimes get a treat and say come when your pig is a little farther away keep increasing the distance and your pig will learn to come to your side upon command 16 x research source once your pig has a handle on this command gradually decrease the number of treats you provide you ll find it to be useful in many situations beyond mealtime but keep rewarding your pig with affection and positive reinforcement 17 x research source urge your pig to walk backward for the leave it command when your pig wanders into an off limits area or towards an off limits item you can use the command leave it back or out stand in front of the pig and slowly walk towards it until it begins to walk backward or away from you repeat the command with every step the pig takes in the right direction then reward it with a treat and some affection when it has completely left the off limits area 18 x research source you can also motion your hands in front of your body to shoo the pig backward but make sure you exhibit a positive energy and give positive reinforcement don t scare the pig away pigs are relatively stubborn so this command might take a while for yours to learn even once it knows the command it might not follow immediately expect to repeat this command regularly use a hand gesture along with the stay command select a hand gesture for the stay or wait command you can use a raised palm or pointed finger whichever you re not using for the no command say the command with the hand gesture and wait a few moments while your pig stays still then deliver a reward and praise 19 x research source over time stand farther away and even back up while repeating the command but make sure you go directly to your pig to deliver the reward this way your pig will learn that it doesn t need to go to you to get the treat since you will go to it teach your pig the spin trick by rotating a treat around its body pick a command to use with this trick it can be spin or dance or you can say left and right to teach your pig to turn in different directions 20 x research source hold a treat out in front of your pig s snout and then rotate it in a wide circle to encourage the pig to rotate its body once the treat and the pig have completed a full rotation deliver the reward 21 x research source since this action doesn t require any challenging movements or body adjustments it can be a great first trick to teach your pig your pig is likely to pick up this trick quickly or within just a few weeks once it understands the premise of the trick remove the treat but continue gesturing with your hand deliver a treat at the end of the circle gradually transition to offering just positive reinforcement eventually your pig should be able to spin on your verbal command without a hand gesture or a food carrot leading it around it might even start spinning on the spot without your command in anticipation of a treat in these instances deliver positive reinforcement to praise your well trained pig but refrain from offering a treat hold a treat in the air to encourage your pig to do the sit trick when standing pigs can t lift up their heads to look up like other animals can if you hold up a treat above its head it will have to sit down to adjust its perspective 22 x research source hold a treat out in front of the pig s snout and slowly raise it above its head say the word sit as you do this then as soon as the pig s bottom hits the floor deliver the reward 23 x research source refrain from pushing the pig s body down to get it to sit sitting is not an easy natural position for pigs at first it will be focused on the food not what its body is doing after weeks or even months of practice it will associate the movement with the sit command practice sit training on carpeting or grass your pig s hooves might slip on smoother surfaces try practicing this trick against a wall so that your pig doesn t just walk backward 24 x research source gently encourage your pig to lift its hoof for the shake trick while sitting in front of your pig gently tap on the back of its front leg while saying the shake command once your pig has become comfortable with this contact lightly lift your pig s hoof off the ground when you say shake keep repeating this process and soon enough your pig will anticipate the leg lift 25 x research source once your pig has mastered shake after a few weeks it might be ready for wave say the shake command without positioning your hand near its hoof if the pig lifts its hoof reward this behavior and introduce the wave command 26 x research source getting your pig comfortable with having its hooves touched will be helpful when it comes time for you or a vet to trim them,Pets-and-Animals

how to know when you have too many pets,you re thinking about adopting or rescuing another pet however too many pets can put a strain on your time energy finances resources and living space how do you know when to say no to another pet you need to be sure you can take care of all your animals as well as yourself and follow local ordinances to avoid losing pets getting fined or arrested,consider time spent caring for your pets cleaning feeding grooming exercising and ensuring a supply of fresh water is available for your animals takes time see how long it takes you each day to properly care for all the animals you own compare this with the amount of free time you have available after other obligations are met such as work school family time etc make sure you won t be neglecting another area of your life to care for all your animals always remember to take care of your pets if you don t have time to take care of them all or don t remember which ones you have taken care of that day you may have to get rid of some of them some animal types will require different maintenance a long haired dog for example probably needs to be brushed daily while a cat can groom himself bird and hamster cages need to be cleaned out and disinfected often with soiled bedding removed regularly be sure to consider the total amount of time you spend on all caretaking tasks for each animal you own each day week and month the amount of free time you have available and are willing to spend caring for pets will determine how much time you spend with them however if it takes over two to three hours to take care of all your animals every day then you may already have too many pets calculate space requirements for your pets consider what your living arrangements are how large is the living area and yard space you have for your animals if you live in a small upstairs apartment without a yard then take that into account when thinking about how many animals you can house if you live out in the country on several acres then you can probably keep more animals remember that each animal needs to have enough room to walk around and not be in a cramped space while space definitely needs to be considered so that everyone can live together comfortably time is the more important factor here if you have the time to walk your dogs then providing a large area to run in is not as important as making sure you can take them for walks every day to meet their exercise needs make sure you have the ability to care for your pets your health status is an important factor to consider when getting more pets be aware of what you can and cannot handle without assistance if you have difficulty getting around on your own another pet may not be the best idea also consider your mental health status depression can make it very difficult to care for yourself as well as pets your animals rely on you so not taking on more than you can handle is very important for everyone s wellbeing animals can cause stress and contribute to mental health problems such as anxiety you are responsible for your pets the more animals you have the more their needs health issues and behavior can weigh on you count the number of pets you already have though the number of pets you have can give you an idea of whether you already have a lot the resources that you have available are more important than the actual number of animals you own 1 x research source you need to be able to care for and provide an enriching environment for all your animals so that they can be happy and bring you joy as companions instead of more life stress 2 x research source consider what species of animals you have as well as individual temperaments and group sexual dynamics before getting another pet overcrowding may have a negative effect on the pets you already have for example it s recognized that in household with five cats or more there is a high likelihood of inappropriate spraying in order to mark territory this is because the cats view the presence of other cats as a threat the more cats the bigger the perceived threat so consider whether or not it s fair to take on another pet if it adds to the stress of your existing pets if you can t count all your pets or lose count you have too many pets and shouldn t get any more while some people may look down on a person with 10 cats as long as the owner can provide a sanitary place to live afford medical care and emergency services for each cat as well as meet their own needs and pay bills then there isn t a problem the pack mentality can increase as you get more dogs and this can cause more behavioral problems because the social dynamics become more complex and your ability to give attention to each animal is lessened 3 x research source mixing male and female animals can increase competition hormones territorial tendencies and breeding behavior all contribute to problems you will have to deal with keep this in mind before adding new pets to the ones you already have create a budget write down your expected expenses and income for the month use bank statements receipts and bills to help determine what you re spending every month include your house or rent payment car payments insurance groceries gas utilities and other spending be sure to include all the expenses related to your pets such as food grooming toys bedding supplies medications and healthcare costs doing this will allow you to see how much you are spending on your pets every month consider how adding another pet will change these numbers is it something you still want to do consider what you could spend your money on without pets looking at the numbers what could you afford if you didn t have so many pets look at yearling savings as well as monthly this can really show you whether another pet is worth it or not if you didn t have pets could you increase your entertainment costs or pay for a car could you take that trip you ve been wanting to take now think about the monthly and yearly costs associated with getting another pet what will you have to cut out of your budget and lose make sure all your needs are being met don t skip meals to pay for your cats litter make sure you get the nutrition you need and can pay your bills on time if you re regularly making late rent payments or not going to the doctor so you can buy your dogs food then you probably don t need another pet pay for medical care medical care for animals can be expensive sometimes thousands of dollars a visit you ll want to be able to save up money regularly in case you need to pay for emergency care or buy prescription medications for your animals you need to be financially prepared for each animal that you own keep up to date with shots many young animals need a series of vaccinations the first year and regular rabies vaccinations after that if you have multiple animals pet insurance may be a good option be sure you can make your payments every month and pay any remaining balances for each pet find out what the rules are your apartment or neighborhood may have rules that dictate the size breed and number of animals you can have check your lease talk to your landlord or your neighborhood association to find out if there is a limit to how many animals you can keep on your property check city county and state laws your local animal control and zoning laws

how to be friends with your pet,living with an animal is a lot like living with a human friend it s important to set clear boundaries treat each other with respect acknowledge one another s needs and spend quality time together unlike living with a human friend however your pet depends on you for food health care and affection among other things the specific ways in which you become friends with your pet will differ depending on what sort of animal you have,be calm this one is pretty self explanatory breathe regularly make your movements smooth and slow though not so slow that they look abnormal as this will also freak some animals out and speak in a calm normal voice avoid being loud just think how you would feel if someone seemed to be nervous around you was fidgeting a lot and speaking loudly and nervously and making quick jerky movements this would make most people feel at least a little nervous it s the same for animals try to always be calm when dealing with your pets no matter what they ve done if you re very upset at them take a moment to calm yourself down before dealing with them you want them to respect you not fear you be patient realize that it could take some time to build a lasting bond with your pet some animals like puppies and kittens might naturally be more easy around you than smaller mammals and reptiles who might be more prone to defensive behaviour if your pet doesn t warm up to you right away give it time with consistent kind respectful behaviour and the appropriate use of treats you should be able to win it over be consistent be consistent in everything you do from feeding to training and everything in between pets are like children in that they need consistency and structure in order to feel safe and secure when they know what they can expect from you your pets are more likely to feel comfortable around you unless what they can expect from you is unpredictable aggressive behaviour which they won t like be the boss set rules and boundaries and stick to them set aside time to practise these rules and boundaries with your pet each day if your pet breaks a rule use body language and calm but firm words to let them know that what they have done is not okay once you ve established that you re the boss it s okay to be more soft and loving with them while still consistently enforcing the rules with dogs they call this being the alpha dog dogs are happiest when they have confidence that you are their leader and can make decisions for them they can then have freedom off lead and with people other animals and in strange situations because they look to you for guidance and you pass on confidence it s okay for you to feel that you are friends with your dog but your dog needs to know that you are his leader cats can be less easy to control as they often like being the alpha if your cat bullies you often attacking you or ignoring your rules a good way to train it is to simply ignore it when it does bad things and praise it when it does things that you approve of cats might not like being controlled but they like being ignored even less food is a good way to establish that you re the boss most animals will notice that you re the one that feeds them every day which will make them look forward to seeing you if you give them treats when they do something good they ll want to make you happy never use violent actions or language to communicate your displeasure with your pet if your pet does something you disapprove of calmly and firmly let them know it s not okay without physically hurting them or screaming at them hurting them will make them more likely to attack you not obey you understand your pet s body language body language is vastly different depending on what sort of animal you have chosen for your pet if you re unsure of your pet s body language consider buying a book or reading some websites devoted to your specific animal understanding your pet s body language will help you to be a better communicator as you can even mimic some of their stances expressions and sounds to send your message in a way they understand when dogs feel stressed out or threatened their eyes will look larger than normal if your dog is not feeling well it might look as though it s squinting if your dog isn t looking directly at you but is looking out of the corners of its eyes so that you see a lot of the whites of the eyes this is called whale eyes he might be about to have an aggressive outburst if your dog is feeling stressed or aggressive its wide eyes will be accompanied by a rigid body 1 x trustworthy source american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty go to source if your cat looks at you and blinks at you slowly it s likely communicating affection you can do this back at your cat to show your love too for cats closing one s eyes in the presence of another is a way to show trust if your cat feels threatened its tail will likely be upright and poofy looking like the end of a toilet brush its back will likely be arched too 2 x research source birds can be quite expressive through their eyes feathers and voices if your bird s pupils enlarge and shrink rapidly this can be a sign that they re excited or greatly interested or scared or angry context is important in telling which emotion it might be birds will ruffle their feathers while cleaning themselves if their feathers remain ruffled however this could mean they re unwell in which case take them to a vet for a checkup 3 x research source respect your pet s likes and dislikes animal experts give us general guidelines about what to expect from animals but as with people most animals will have their own quirks it s important that you respect your pet s individuality don t try to make it do things that it clearly doesn t like note that this isn t the same as letting your pet run your house or bully you you still need to consistently stand by your rules and boundaries dogs are generally known to be affectionate and to want to be close to their owners at all times some dogs though and shiba inus are known for this prefer not to be petted or cuddled if your dog seems to dislike being petted don t force it maybe it likes to have an hour of alone time in another room of the house each night as long as it s not chewing on your furniture or digging a hole in the carpet let it have its alone time it s not a bad idea to think of cats as weird roommates instead of animals one minute your cat might be all over you and very affectionate and within seconds it might jump off of you and run away not to be seen for several hours as long as it isn t hurting you or your home accept the quirk and let it be its own person see the world through your pet s eyes be empathetic when dealing with your pet you don t know what s going on in its mind so it s best to try to read its body language and try to imagine what it must be going through so that you can treat it as well as possible a rescue dog may have been abused by its previous owner it may have spent most of its life before meeting you living on the streets starving and scared there is a lot of evidence countless rescue stories and videos online that proves these dogs who may lash out at first come around to love and trust their humans and vice versa if your dog is behaving in ways that you dislike calmly gently and consistently reinforce the rules and they will come around if your pet is a small mammal rat gerbil guinea pig rabbit don t swoop down on them suddenly and pick them up and then be surprised when they seem terrified these are animals who are commonly preyed upon from above so if you want to gain their trust and affection it s best not to behave like a predator play together if you can t directly play with your pet learn how your pet likes to play or how their specific breed species plays acts and do your best to enable them to do so whether it s with you or merely in your presence this is may be easier to do with a cat or dog as they both play in ways that are more familiar to human beings throwing a ball around chasing one another playing tag running and jumping some snakes enjoy climbing if you want to feel more of a bond with your pet snake and you feel safe letting it out of its enclosure consider getting it a large climbing post and allowing it to do that as you work out that way you can feel as though you re being active together if you do this regularly it can begin to feel like a routine you can buy play gyms for birds put your bird on its play gym on your floor or table in the room with you while you work read exercise or watch tv and allow the bird to play have adventures together take your dog on a hike somewhere it s never been go for a walk with your iguana or snake on your shoulder or arm if it s social bring home a new toy and play with your cat animals get bored too introducing fun new things into their lives now and then will make them happy just be smart about what you introduce most cats wouldn t enjoy going to a dog park for example teach your pet new things many different animals enjoy learning tricks to earn rewards such as food or toys teach your dog or cat some new tricks or sing a song and dance with your bird it will likely learn to bob along with you if you bounce up and down in front of it set up an obstacle course for your pet rat and reward it for completing the course hang out with your pet literally just be in the same room with them let them be near you while you make dinner watch tv or read a book the more you re around one another the better chances you have of becoming friends many snake owners say that their snakes enjoy wrapping around their arms or necks while they sit on the couch or go for walks or even drive of course if you re not sure whether your snake is cuddling you or trying to strangle you it s probably better not to wear it around your neck show affection to your pet if your pet is receptive to physical affection provide it cuddle up on the couch with your cat dog reptile bird etc talk to your pet sure they

how to brush matted fur,matted fur can be really uncomfortable for an animal the tangles pull on the animal s skin which can lead to irritation and even infections luckily in some cases you may be able to remove the mat yourself try gently combing through the mat using a detangler if necessary if that doesn t work you may need to carefully cut the mat away of course if you have any hesitation or concerns bring the animal to a veterinarian or a professional groomer to get it checked out,try combing the mat first if you can work your fingers into it press the mat between your thumb and first finger or your first 2 fingers if the mat is very large if the matted fur separates beneath your fingers or your finger and thumb touch through the fur you may be able to use a comb to gently detangle the mat 1 x research source typically the earlier you can catch a mat the easier it will be to detangle that s why you should examine your pet s coat daily especially if the animal has long hair that s prone to tangling if the fur is matted together to the point that it feels hard trying to detangle it may cause unnecessary pain or stress to the animal and it could even cause it to become aggressive cut the mat if the fur is matted tightly but it s not against the animal s skin even if the mat is too serious to detangle with a comb you may still be able to remove it yourself if you can work your fingers beneath the mat and clearly feel that there s a separation between the tangled fur and the skin you may be able to safely cut the mat away 2 x research source if you have any question about whether it s safe to cut the mat take the animal to a vet or a professional groomer call a professional groomer if the mat is tight against the skin 3 x expert source lancy woo

lead to a severe laceration if you try to cut it away 4 x trustworthy source american society for the prevention of cruelty to animals leading organization dedicated to the prevention of animal cruelty go to source you should also call a professional groomer if the mat is somewhere very sensitive like on the abdomen under the neck or around the genitals or if the animal is scared or aggressive cats in particular can be very skittish when you re working around their abdomen even if they re normally very tame a scared cat might curl around your hand kicking with its back feet and gripping you with its front claws as it tries to bite you a professional will know how to avoid these dangerous situations 5 x research source see your vet if there is any irritation on the skin under the mat if you notice any redness inflammation or broken skin beneath the mat the problem might be too serious for even a professional groomer instead have the animal examined by a vet and ask them how to proceed 6 x research source serious issues including irritation and infection can occur when a mat sits against an animal s skin for a long period of time don t wash the animal before you try to remove any mats when you see an animal with dirty matted fur it might be tempting to give it a good bath right away however if you wash the animal before you detangle its fur the mats will tighten up as they dry which will make them even harder to remove 7 x research source in addition the mats might prevent the soapy water from penetrating the fur all the way to the skin making the bath ineffective if you re detangling dog hair you may want to bathe the dog after you detangle its fur however avoid bathing a cat unless its fur is greasy or smelly they typically groom themselves and you ll just stress it out 8 x research source if the mat is in a horse s mane you can use a special horse shampoo to wash its mane after you finish detangling it use your fingers to break up any tangles and mats as much as possible place the animal on a towel on the ground or a sturdy table and sit or stand close by run your fingers over the animal s fur breaking up as many mats and tangles as you can by hand separate loose hairs from the mats and gently work out any knots you can but don t pull or tear at the animal s fur detangling mats can be a long process and it can be stressful on the animal especially if you re yanking with a comb the whole time using your fingers can help soothe the animal and will decrease the amount of time you spend pulling on the mat try petting the animal as you detangle its fur to help calm it down for instance if you re detangling a mat on a cat s side reach up every so often and stroke the cat s cheeks or chin that way it will associate the grooming with positive attention break apart larger mats with a comb working from the outside in 9 x expert source lancy woo certified pet groomer expert interview 26 february 2020 if you come across a mat that you can t detangle by hand you ll likely need to break it up with a wide toothed metal comb a brush is not as effective at removing mats because it won t penetrate the fur as deeply grip the mat securely with one hand as close to the skin as you can get then try to pick apart the mat with the widest end of your comb using short gentle strokes start at the end of the mat furthest from the animal s skin and work your way inward 10 x research source do not yank on the mat as this is likely to upset the animal also avoid raking the comb directly across the animal s skin as this could cause irritation over time this part of the process takes time and patience work in small sections and if the animal starts getting frustrated take a break if it creates a negative association with the grooming process you ll have a harder time keeping the mats from coming back if you re detangling the fur on a treat motivated animal like a dog cat or horse offer it treats and plenty of soft soothing praise if it s acting calm and relaxed saturate a stubborn mat with a detangling product for that specific animal 11 x expert source lancy woo certified pet groomer expert interview 26 february 2020 deep conditioning products contain oils that can help the animal s fur slip out of the mat if a mat is too tangled to comb out soak it with a detangler and let it soak in for about 30 minutes then come back and try to break the mat apart with your fingers or comb it apart 12 x research source because animals have different skin phs you should never use products intended for another animal for example you shouldn t use a conditioner for a horse s mane on a dog however you may find some detanglers that are intended for both cats and dogs if that s the case it should clearly say so on the label also never use human skin or hair care products on an animal 13 x research source go back over the area with a fine comb or brush once you remove the mat many combs for animal grooming have a wider side and a fine tooth side if that s the case comb back through the animal s fur with the finer side once you ve gotten most of the mat free this will help you catch any smaller tangles that might be left behind 14 x research source if your comb is only one width use a smaller fine tooth metal comb or go over the area with the animal s normal brush for example you might use a small slicker brush on a long haired cat or a bristle brush for a dog with a medium coat use a razor comb to try to cut out the mat first a razor comb which may also be called a rake tool or a mat splitting tool looks like a wide comb with long sharp teeth 15 x expert source lancy woo certified pet groomer expert interview 26 february 2020 press your hand against the animal s skin to help reduce pulling then work the teeth of the razor comb under the mat and gently pull down in the direction the hair grows don t yank just allow the tool to gently slice through the matted fur as far as it will go it may take several passes to cut through the hair holding the mat in place 16 x research source doing this will remove smaller mats but it may also help loosen the tension on larger mats helping the animal be more comfortable as you continue you can find these tools at most pet supply stores choose a size that s best for your animal for instance you would want a smaller razor comb for cats and small dogs and a larger tool for larger dogs this tool is very sharp so always use caution when you re using it also be sure to always have the sharp ends pointing upward away from the animal s skin similarly don t apply too much pressure on the tool as it s easy to accidentally rake the skin and cause injury take special care around angled areas like the legs and tail cut out large stubborn mats with hair clippers use your hand to pull the animal s skin as flat and tight as you can around the mat then turn on the clippers and lightly run them over the very surface of the mat moving in the direction that the fur is growing if you need to you can make several passes gently running the clippers over the surface of the mat each time however don t clip all the way to the animal s skin just stop once you ve removed the bulk of the mat 17 x research source before you try to use clippers make sure the animal is stable and calm and have someone else hold it still if you can speak to the animal in a soothing voice to reassure it throughout the process and stop if it gets agitated if you re grooming a cat it may help to have someone gently hold it by the scruff of its neck this can actually help calm a cat since it s the way mother cats carry kittens when they re young 18 x research source if the animal is so matted that it needs to be completely shaved take it to a professional groomer however if your cat typically experiences a lot of stress during grooming it may be best to take your cat to the vet who can sedate your cat during the removal process not only will this make your cat more comfortable and stress free it will also prevent your cat from becoming more fearful of grooming in the future check the clippers every minute or so to make sure they aren t too hot clippers can get really hot which can burn the animal if you re not careful about every 60 seconds turn off the clippers and lightly touch your hand to the blade if it s uncomfortably hot to the touch it s too hot for the animal wait a few minutes for the clippers to cool down before you turn them on again 19 x research source you can also use a cooling spray designed for clippers to help keep the blade from overheating try to detangle the fur with a comb once you ve removed most of the mat often removing the outer surface of a mat will help loosen it enough that you can finish the detangling process with your fingers or a wide tooth comb if you still can t loosen the mat clip away a little more fur or call a professional if you re concerned you need to clip too close to the skin 20 x research source a detangling spray may also be useful after you ve removed the bulk of the mat saturate the animal s fur with the spray and let it sit for about 30 minutes or the amount of time recommended on the product label then gently comb the animal s fur to loosen any remaining tangles,Pets-and-Animals

how to catch a bobcat,since they look like bigger versions of your ordinary house cat bobcats are fun to spot in the wild they are brown colored with pointy ears and a black bobbed tail they are normally shy animals that prefer to stay hidden but sometimes they threaten small pets or even attack humans catching a bobcat takes a good trap the right bait and some patience in some areas you can also get a permit to hunt bobcats for their fur 1 x research source,check local rules and regulations about trapping bobcats contact your state conservation office for more information in the u s for example all but a handful of states restrict bobcat hunting if you plan on trapping a bobcat you have to do it in a safe humane way and then release it within 24 hours if hunting is legal in your area apply for a permit at the conservation office 2 x research source some areas have rules stating that you have to use rubber jawed traps for instance and label them with your name and address watch out for permit requirements you usually need a bobcat permit to hunt you might also have to request a separate permit to use steel traps or hunt at night states that allow bobcat hunting require you to register each pelt with the conservation office in some places the tags come with a bobcat hunting permit look in rocky elevated areas for more chances to find bobcats bobcats can be found in a wide variety of areas even in your own backyard however they prefer areas with a little more cover try checking out ledges dry creek beds cliffs and rocky outcroppings they prefer isolated areas they can look down on but they can be found in other areas as well 3 x research source some bobcats live in swamps or forests with long grass bushes and trees to hide in another spot to look is around abandoned buildings especially if they don t receive a lot of foot traffic or have grassy fields nearby bobcats go there to hide and hunt bobcats have been known to appear in small rural towns but they can even appear around large cities there is plenty of food there so you may be able to catch one without ever leaving your home if you think a bobcat is visiting your home then you can just set the trap in your yard they also tend to visit open fields so look there too if you have any nearby search for wide cat like tracks left by bobcats if you know where one likes to prowl you have a good chance of catching one by setting a baited trap there bobcat prints consist of 4 toes and a wide lower pad they are bigger than house cat tracks but shorter than dog or coyote tracks they are usually around 22 in 56 cm long and 2 1 4 in 5 7 cm wide 4 x research source a bobcat s back paws are slightly smaller and rounder than their front ones lynx and cougar tracks are much larger bobcats are just a little bit bigger than house cats so their tracks aren t that much bigger the only downside to following tracks is that bobcats travel along a wide hunting area if you re tracking one out in the wild you might have to wait a while for it to come back watch for gray 4 in 10 cm long scat or other signs their poop is about 3 4 in 1 9 cm wide with rounded ends it looks segmented and may have ground up bones in it bobcats also partially cover it by scratching up leaves and dirt like a pet cat in a litter box bobcats also make scent mounts about 6 in 15 cm tall covered with the same nasty ammonia smell regular house cats leave behind 5 x research source mountain lions leave larger poop foxes leave smaller pointer poop that often has fur and bones in it coyote poop is the same size but darker and with fur bones or berries in it watch out for possible food sources bobcats eat meat only so you may see partially eaten animals but they won t touch fruit or anything else look for any rocky ledges in the area bobcats can be found in a wide variety of places but they are most common around ledges look for signs of tracks or their dens there if you can set your traps nearby you usually won t have to wait as long to lure one in 6 x research source they like rocky ledges because it s safe and high up they can see anything coming toward them including whatever they are hunting bobcats also live in swamps bogs forests and other areas so you can still catch one if you don t live near a ledge some of them come into towns to search for food and you can set a trap in your yard to lure them in select a cage trap to humanely catch a bobcat and relocate it cage traps are a great choice for inexperienced trappers and they don t hurt animals at all try getting a heavy wire cage that is at least 3 ft 0 91 m long 2 ft 0 61 m wide and 4 ft 1 2 m tall pick one with a pressure plate called a treadle when the bobcat steps on the plate the door slams shut and you don t have to be anywhere near the cage to lock it 7 x research source cage traps don t harm bobcats and they won t harm any other animals that stumble in if you re just trying to relocate a bobcat this is the best choice the second best type of trap is a rubber jawed paw trap when the bobcat steps on the trap the jaws close around its paw this trap is much easier to hide but it also can cause a lot of stress for the stuck bobcat refrain from using lethal traps unless they are legal in your area get permission from a conservation office first these traps can be inhumane to animals and dangerous to inexperienced trappers so set them up with caution if you absolutely have to take out a bobcat you could use a conibear or bodygrip trap this kind of trap clamps down hard killing the animal quickly in most cases 8 x research source if you re looking for the least harmful trap use a rubber jawed paw trap it keeps the bobcat still so you can shoot it from a distance killing it as painlessly as possible lethal traps should only be used in the wild they are dangerous and can easily trap pets for instance keep traps away from areas with other animals keeping foxes coyotes and other animals out of your trap is difficult if they are active in the same area the best way to do this is to use a non lethal trap and monitor it all the time make sure your traps are well hidden near areas where you know bobcats live use fresh meat for bait since bobcats won t go after spoiled meat if you think they have moved on pack up your trap so nothing else ends up in it 9 x research source for example if you put a trap in your backyard you should only have it out at night when bobcats are most active remove the bait and close it up in the daytime if you happen to catch something other than a bobcat free it as soon as possible report injured animals to the nearest wildlife department wait for help instead of releasing them back into the wild place the trap in a sheltered spot near the tracks try to find a spot where you can tuck away the trap to hide it if you re able to find a spot with a few trees branches or rocks you can use them to set everything up turn the trap so the open end is facing outward toward the spot you expect the bobcat to come from keep the closed end backed up against a tree trunk cliff or something else 10 x research source you don t have to find an enclosed area to place your trap but it helps lure the bobcat in bobcats are cautious the more natural the area looks the more likely a bobcat is to wander toward it do the best you can to hide the trap if you aren t able to cover it extremely well put extra effort into getting quality lures and bait cover the floor of the trap with soil bring a small shovel with you take some dirt from a nearby area away from the trap cover up as much of the metal floor as possible to blend the trap in with its surroundings the dirt will also help stabilize the trap so the bobcat can t knock it over 11 x research source grass is also useful for covering up mesh flooring or a paw trap pad but don t dig up anything unless it s legal to do so instead use dirt sticks or even rocks if you re using a spring loaded trap make sure it s sensitive enough to activate when the bobcat steps on it some small traps won t trigger especially when they are covered put branches over the cage to help cover it do what you can to camouflage the trap for instance take some big branches and lean them against the cage fill in additional space with leaves sticks and loose grass collected off of the ground hide as much of the metal as you can but don t cover the cage s opening 12 x research source if you re in an area without a lot of ground covering do the best you can find a sheltered spot close to the bobcat s territory such as a nearby cliff cover the trap s floor first then use anything else available to cover the rest if a bobcat sees an unusual object like a big metal cage it becomes cautious and keeps its distance a bobcat is more likely to approach a well hidden trap choose a shiny object like aluminum foil to use as a lure cut a strip of foil about 1 in 2 5 cm wide poke a hole through one end and slip a length of fishing wire through it you can use the wire to hang the lure near your trap if you have enough room you can position several lures to catch the bobcat s attention 13 x research source christmas tinsel also works well alternatively use a shiny piece of metal or a colored strip of cloth bobcats are just big cats if you have ever had a pet cat you might have seen how they can t resist unusual things that catch their attention bobcats are no different hang the lure somewhere near your cage take advantage of nearby trees for instance wrap the wire around the tree about 2 ft 0 61 m off the ground knot it and make sure it s secure as long as the lure reflects light and flutters in the breeze a bobcat is bound to see it 14 x research source position the lure near your trap but not over it it is there to lure the bobcat into the area not into the trap it could cause them to avoid the trap or spring it too early if you don t have trees nearby look for other opportunities for example you could try placing a nail in a rock then tying the lure to it choose a smelly piece of meat to use as bait bobcats enjoy meat but they don t have a great sense of smell one of the simplest ways to overcome this is with a fish that has a strong odor such as sardines or mackerel if you don t have fish available select a spiced meat such as hot dogs you don t have to cook the bait since bobcats eat raw meat in the wild 15 x research source some trappers age meat to give it a stronger scent you can do it by wrapping a quality piece of meat in cheesecloth and setting it in the refrigerator animal parts are fine if they are legal to use in your area you could use a piece of squirrel meat for instance even if it still has some fur or bones bobcats eat raw meat from animals like rabbits rodents and birds place a piece of bait in the back of the trap if you re using a cage trap place the bait all the way in the back past the trigger for the door that way the bobcat will step on the door trigger as it walks past make sure the food stays inside the cage especially if you weren t able to fill in the entire floor keep it centered and easily detectable 16 x research source if you re using another kind of trap place food inside the trap so the bobcat has to walk into it some people also hang food or lures over paw traps to tempt the bobcat over you could also spread some food around the trap to help lead the bobcat to it for instance scatter some right in front of the trap keep in mind however that other animals may get to it first use a bobcat scent lure to help attract bobcats to the trap doing this is optional but it can increase your chances of luring in a bobcat purchase a bottle of bobcat gland scent or even bobcat urine spread about 20 to 30 drops of the scent on the ground close to the trap s entrance you can also place a few drops nearby such as on clumps of grass and trees 17 x research source a quality scent lets the bobcat know that the area is safe the scent means that another bobcat passed through there so they come to inspect it if you happen to have animal parts like bones fur or feathers you can also place them near the trap to use as a lure this isn t legal everywhere though scents are available online and are available at many hunting supply stores cover your tracks after you re done setting up the trap take a quick look around the area notice anything that looks out of place make sure your trap is well covered for instance then spread dirt over visible footprints if you flipped over a rock put it back the way it was leave no stone unturned 18 x research source anything that looks out of the ordinary could scare away bobcats so be thorough when cleaning up don t leave anything behind if you have trash or supplies take them with you check the trap every morning to see if it s still active bobcats roam around at dusk and sunrise so try to get back to your trap right away if you don t see anything in it look to see if the bait is gone open the trap back up and restock it with fresh food return to it each day in case anything changes 19 x research source don t leave an animal sitting in a trap for long you will end up with one scared hungry cranky cat it s also illegal in most areas to keep animals captive for more than 24 hours wait 2 to 4 weeks before moving the trap most traps are fine for about 3 weeks on average when left undisturbed if you don t catch anything by then look around at your setup if you still expect a bobcat to come through the area then replace the bait and reapply the scent make sure the trap is still well hidden and that nothing about it would scare a bobcat away 20 x research source a male bobcat s territory is 30 sq mi 78 km2 or more in size so don t worry if you don t catch one right away if you wait long enough the bobcat will eventually come back during rainy periods take more time to refresh your trap the rain could wash away your preparations scents usually have to be reapplied within 7 days call your local wildlife agency if you catch a bobcat let them deal with handling the bobcat you could also call a professional animal removal service or a big cat animal sanctuary if you have one in your area bobcats can be dangerous so don t handle them yourself unless you have to in most cases you can t safely put them back into the while on your own 21 x research source bobcats have to be taken far away so they don t come back but that puts them in unfamiliar territory they could be attacked by other animals get hit by a car or otherwise suffer

never overfeed your fish make sure there is nothing in your fish tank that can cut or shred your fish s fins use a net to scoop the fish out of your tank if you use a container you may cut the fins or damage the scales encourage a fish to grow by keeping it in its own tank and change 30 of the water every few days train your fish judges look for a fish that swims around a lot and hold its fins up like its variety should feed baby chicks high protein food until they are about 18 weeks old then they switch to a feed that contains corn and soybean meal before a show give the chicks a mild dish and give them a final rinse of lemon juice to bring out the feather s highlights don t get any in their eyes preen the feathers so all of them are pointing in the same direction and are not pointing in the different directions while they dry rub a little canola oil and rosemary on the legs to kill mites and make the legs shine do some research on the breed s desirable characteristics winning chicks are those that show all of the characteristics of their breed and are easily handled if you handle the chicks every other day for 10 minutes or so right from the time they hatch they will be well mannered when the judges inspect them feed the rodent lots of fresh fruit and whole grains to keep their coats in good condition rats and mice spend a lot of time cleaning themselves so you shouldn t have to do too much grooming handle rats and mice everyday beginning at birth this way they will be more accustomed to people judges say the perfect rat or mouse is pleasing to the eye and should be curious and active train your rodent to do special tricks if you train your animal to give kisses walk on a tightrope or jump to you on command you will definitely catch the judges eye feed your cattle a basic diet of protein corn and oats you may need expert advice on how to adjust the amounts of each so that the animals fill out at the right time keep cattle inside during really hot weather they may even need fans to keep them cool don t keep them on cement this can make them stiff legged the judges like to see animals that are flexible and able to take long strides brush your cattle at least three times a day groom them before a show by washing them with dish detergent and rinse them well so that they don t have flaky skin at show time some experts trim their cattle s coats so that their muscles are emphasized work with them every day to get them halter trained this means having to get them used to you touching them then teaching them how to lead use a small pen to get the animal used to you talk to it and get it to eat from your hand once you have gained its trust and it feels comfortable enough to let you give it a scratch along the back which may take from a few days to several weeks then it s time to put a halter on put the halter on and tie to a sturdy fence or post that it can t break brush it talk to it and be calm around it keep doing this until it stands calmly whenever it is haltered and tied lead it around using a stick to keep it in line make sure you are always ahead of it not it ahead of you otherwise if you let that happen you will have a problem animal you will also need to practice with a show halter not just a rope halter since the animal will act differently with a show halter on practice a little at a time to get it to pose do only a few seconds at first then increase the time because the pose will be quite uncomfortable for it by the end of the training session the animal should be well trained and able to pose for 15 to 20 minutes choose a well presented breed most judges like to see the long haired variety such as peruvian guinea pigs american short hairs can still be entered however some shows will favor more exotic breeds instead himalayan and rex breeds are a good show breed variety of short haired guinea pigs check for health issues your guinea pig needs to be healthy and in good shape a sick guinea pig will lead to immediate disqualification their eyes should be alert their nose should be clear their ears and coat should be clean and you should check their droppings and urine groom your guinea pig s fur long haired breeds will require more maintenance on their fur to keep it from matting and or forming knots you may want to consider trimming the fur too clip the nails they should be filed back evenly overgrown nails will drag your guinea pig s ranking down quite a lot,Pets-and-Animals

you the opportunity to remember your fish and say goodbye but can also be the time that you take care of the remains this can be a few last words before a trash receptacle service or a full blown funeral with burial it is your choice 3 x research source have a few moments of silence to reflect on your relationship with your fish you may want to say a few words play a song or read a poem that reminds you of your fish some people light a small candle in honor of their fish you could also plant a flower or a tree in memory of your pet draw or paint a picture of your pet fish to place in a special spot in your home or write a letter to your pet expressing your gratitude for the life your pet had save your memories although it might be too painful for you to look through now later you will be glad you preserved the memories if you have things that remind you of your fish put them away so that later you can reflect on your pet create a scrapbook you might include a brochure from the pet store about the fish drawings photos the leaves of the fake or live plants from the tank etc 4 x research source write a poem short story or biography about your fish make a slideshow or frame a photo of your fish use your aquarium as a memorial you can use your tank to honor the memory of your fish in a variety of creative ways if you are still using the tank for other fish you may want to put something in there in memory of the fish you lost it could be a tiny hand made tombstone or a pretty rock or seashell with a coloring and pattern that reminds you of your fish if you don t have other fish you can clean the aquarium out and use it to hold a memorial plant or flowers if the tank is empty and looking at it causes you too much pain then clean it out and put it away put a nice plant or decoration in the place where the fish tank used to be you can also decide to keep your fish in safe place like a box it can be homemade or have your little one cremated make sure it s really dead sometimes fish can appear dead but are actually sick or in distress before you dispose of the body make sure that your fish is actually dead 5 x research source sometimes fish can swim on their side or upside down because they are constipated check the gills eyes and skin carefully watch the gill covers closely for a few moments watch your fish to make sure it s not just breathing very slowly does it respond when you gently nudge it if the skin has become discolored or white it may indicate rotting parasites or disease look at your fish s eyes if the eyes have turned grey then the fish has passed on try to determine why your fish died if possible look the fish over and try to figure out why it died especially if you have other fish in that tank or plan on getting another fish in the future this can help you prevent future deaths it can also give you a sense of closure so that you aren t continually wondering why your fish died check the water levels was the tank too full did the fish jump out because the water level was too high or because there wasn t a lid on the tank was there enough water in the tank test the water quality are the ph ammonia nitrite etc levels what they should be is there obvious injury split fins open wounds etc does it appear the fish got into a fight or injured by some of the tank equipment do you see any signs of disease infection or parasites is the body discolored or bloated is it possible your fish ate too much or became poisoned by something foreign in the tank properly and respectfully dispose of the body once you are sure your fish is dead then you need to take care of the remains there are several options you have for taking care of the body and the final decision is up to you while many people flush their fish down the toilet this is not recommended 6 x research source if the fish died of a disease it could pollute the local water don t put your dead fish in a body of water such as a pond river or the ocean your fish could be carrying a disease which can infect wildlife 7 x research source you can bury it in the backyard a composting area or a flower pot make sure you bury the body at least two feet deep 60 cm so that other animals don t dig the body up some people believe that the body doesn t contain the spirit of the fish anymore and simply place their fish s body in the trash 8 x research source make sure your other fish are healthy check your fish often to make sure everything is okay is there anything you can do to prevent your other fish from dying if your fish died from a disease or parasite keep a close eye on any remaining fish in case they get sick too change the water immediately after you remove your dead fish this will help remove harmful viruses bacteria etc that may be in the water if you don t have one already invest in a filter and for tropical fish including bettas a heater make sure that your tank is large enough for the fish you keep or plan on keeping invest in a quarantine tank this can be a smart move if a fish falls ill in the future putting it in the quarantine tank can give you time to closely observe it and try to determine what is wrong it also helps protect any other fish you may have consider getting a new fish you may want to get a new fish or two not necessarily to replace the fish that died but to continue the type of relationship you had with that fish you can even get a new fish that resembles the one you have lost if you re thinking about getting a new fish remember that you will have to cycle the tank again before adding your new fish if the water and everything else seem okay add more fish to the aquarium after about a week this will give you time to monitor the other fish the water etc to make sure everything is as it should be only add a few new fish at a time this will make it easier for you to watch all the fish to see how they are getting along and to make sure that they are all healthy,Pets-and-Animals
how to kill mealybugs,mealybugs are small white insects that feed on the sap in plants although mealybugs are small they can cause significant damage to your plants and garden if left untreated if your plants are starting to wilt and die it may be from mealybugs fortunately there are several methods you can use to eliminate mealybugs so your plants stay green and healthy,dip a cotton swab in 70 percent isopropyl rubbing alcohol avoid using other kinds of alcohol or you could damage the plant you re treating 1 x research source rub the cotton swab over the surface of the infested plant make sure you get underneath the leaves and inside the crevices on the branches mealybugs tend to hide in hard to reach places so it s important you completely cover the plant you re treating with the rubbing alcohol 2 x research source use a spray bottle to apply rubbing alcohol to large plants fill the spray bottle with rubbing alcohol and spray it over the surface of large plants that are infested with mealybugs 3 x research source remove any mealybugs you see on the plant mealybugs look like small white bugs with a waxy coating pick the mealybugs off with your hand and dispose of them in the trash 4 x research source mealybugs don t bite but you may want to wear gardening gloves so you don t get their waxy coating on your fingers repeat weekly until the mealybugs are gone since mealybugs are good at hiding in hard to reach places you ll likely need to do multiple applications of rubbing alcohol before they re all killed even if you don t see anymore mealybugs it s a good idea to do a few more applications just in case there are some lingering bugs 5 x research source you ll know the mealybugs are gone when you can t see anymore on the plant and the plant remains healthy and green mix together water liquid dish soap and neem oil in a spray bottle use 1 teaspoon 4 9 ml of neem oil and 2 3 drops of dish soap neem oil is a vegetable oil that comes from neem trees that can be used to kill mealybugs 6 x research source spray the plant you re treating until it s soaked make sure you spray underneath the leaves at the base of the branches and over the top of the soil the plant is in you want the mealybugs to be completely smothered with the neem oil mixture 7 x research source move the plant to a shaded area to dry don t keep the plant in direct sunlight or extreme heat or it could burn if you re spraying outdoor plants that are rooted in the ground wait for a shady day when it s below 85 f 29 c out 8 x research source spray the plant weekly until the mealybugs are gone one application of neem oil probably won t kill all the mealybugs on the plant because mealybugs have a rapid lifecycle you ll need to routinely kill the newly hatched bugs every week until all of the mealybugs have been killed off if the plant looks healthy and you don t see anymore mealybugs on it they re most likely gone prune off any infested branches before you apply an insecticide infested branches will have a waxy white coating on them pruning will help get rid of some of the mealybugs and it will make the insecticide more effective because there will be fewer places for the mealybugs to take shelter 9 x research source use an insecticide that s designed for ornamental plants check the label on the insecticide if you re not sure avoid using insecticides that aren t made for ornamental plants or you could damage the plant you re treating 10 x research source some ornamental insecticides you could use to kill mealybugs are acephate malathion carbaryl and diazinon spray the plant with the insecticide until it s soaked the leaves and branches of the plant should be dripping with insecticide make sure you get underneath the leaves and at the base of the branches on the plant 11 x research source follow the application instructions that came with your insecticide for the best results do regular insecticide applications until the mealybugs are all killed it may take more than one application to remove all the mealybugs on the plant check the instructions that came with your insecticide to see how frequently you can use it without damaging the plant 12 x research source if the plant is thriving and you can t see anymore mealybugs on it you ve likely killed all of the mealybugs inspect new plants for mealybugs before you introduce them to your garden look for small round wax covered insects that have a white color if you find mealybugs on a new plant pick them off and dispose of them if there are a lot of mealybugs on the plant you may need to throw it away or return it to where you bought it from 13 x research source never introduce a mealybug infested plant to your garden or the infestation will spread to your other plants check your plants for mealybugs regularly it s easier to prevent a big mealybug infestation if you routinely eliminate small outbreaks if you discover mealybugs on one of your plants pick them off by hand if the plant if heavily infested remove it from your garden so the infestation doesn t spread 14 x research source throw away garden tools that are infested with mealybugs mealybugs can gather on garden tools like shovels plant clips and pots always check your tools for mealybugs and avoid using them if you find any or the bugs could spread to your other plants 15 x research source avoid fertilizing your plants with nitrogen if possible high levels of nitrogen can cause mealybugs to reproduce faster if your plants don t need a nitrogen fertilizer use a non nitrogen fertilizer instead

how to enjoy having pet fish,enjoying your pet fish all starts with giving it a proper home set up a fish tank with important accessories like a water filter and plants treat the water and keep it clean so the fish stays healthy and happy to stimulate your fish s brain give it toys like floating rocks and caves for it to hide in you can even train your fish to do tricks like swim through a hoop or jump out of the water with a little practice keeping your fish healthy and active will help you enjoy your fish for longer,pick out a tank that s at least 2 ft 24 in long this may seem like a big tank if you have a tiny fish but your fish actually needs lots of space for it to thrive and live healthily pick out a tank that s 2 ft 24 in for small fish and an even larger tank if you have big fish 1 x research source look up your specific species of fish for information about the exact size of tank you should purchase little fish bowls are not big enough for fish such as bettas or goldfish set up your fish tank so it includes a filter water heater and treated water fill the bottom layer of the tank with gravel or sand for the fish to dig around in sand and gravel comes in many different colors for fish tanks visit your local pet store to pick out a fish friendly bottom layer for your fish to dig around in and enjoy 2 x research source purchase enough sand or gravel to cover the entire bottom of the fish tank in a thick layer provide tunnels or nooks for the fish to hide in this helps stimulate a fish s survival instincts by teaching them how to hide purchase little nooks or fish houses at your local pet store or online or make your own using a pvc pipe or similar object 3 x research source before you put anything into the tank wash it thoroughly with clean water to remove dirt or germs on the surface however don t use any detergents or dish soaps as these can make your fish sick place objects like fake plants in the tank to stimulate their brains fish love nibbling on plants and swimming around floating objects set a few small plants in your fish tank settling them into the gravel or sand so they don t fall over 4 x research source floating rocks are a nice addition to a fish tank because they ll love swimming around them add a mirror to the side of the tank for the fish to look at its reflection fish are fascinated by their reflection and this is a great way to ensure your fish isn t bored purchase a mirror specifically designed to go on the outside of a fish tank or attach a reflective surface to your fish tank so it s facing inwards towards the fish 5 x research source if your breed of fish tends to get territorial test its interaction with the mirror and remove the mirror if your fish seems agitated mirrors for fish tanks often attach using suction cups switch out or add new objects every once in a while to keep the fish engaged even if your fish has awesome toys in its tank it may become bored with them after a while every month or so try to put a new object in the tank or move the plants and other toys around so the fish has different surroundings 6 x research source keeping your fish engaged and interested in its tank will improve its mood and health spend time watching your fish to help you relax looking at fish has proven to help calm down the mind having positive impacts on your mental wellbeing take some time to enjoy watching your fish swim around in its tank to help you destress 7 x research source train your fish to follow a target if it s just getting to know you use your finger as the target or use a small stick with a brightly colored end that will catch the fish s attention give the fish a piece of food each time it comes to where the target is moving the target around slowly once the fish gets good at following 8 x research source this is a great way to teach your fish to swim through a hoop as well teach your fish to jump out of the water for a cool trick fish such as bettas and goldfish can often do this trick wet your finger or a pointer stick and attach a piece of fish food to it holding it just over the surface of the water if your fish is hungry it ll try to reach the piece of food by jumping out of the water 9 x research source once your fish is able to grab the piece of food keep raising your finger or stick higher above the water to make it more challenging you may need to wiggle your finger or the stick above the water s surface so your fish notices encourage your fish to push a ball for a cute talent place a small floating ball roughly the size of the fish s head in the fish tank when the fish nudges it give the fish a piece of food continue rewarding the fish with food whenever it touches the ball eventually your fish will start nudging the ball harder to get a treat 10 x research source pay close attention to your fish when you re training it so you re ready to give it a piece of food as soon as it touches the ball avoid tapping on the glass to get your fish s attention this scares the fish and can bother their hearing abilities due to the sound use slow movements when trying to get your fish to notice you 11 x research source tapping on the glass will also likely make your fish hide feed your fish the right amount for its species and weight this information is found on the label of a container of fish food that you would buy at a pet store or big box store fish can also eat small pieces of vegetables like peas or zucchini after they re cleaned and blanched 12 x research source consider creating a chart to help you keep track of when to feed your fish test the water s ph level each week using a kit this will tell you if you have dangerous levels of ammonia nitrate or nitrite meaning the water needs to be changed or treated water testing kits are easy to use and come with a chart to refer to so it s clear what the ph level means follow the directions for your specific kit to help care for your tank 13 x research source purchase a water testing kit from your local pet store or online use a gravel siphon to clean out the tank the gravel siphon is placed into the tank overtop the gravel sucking up the dirt and debris while cleaning the water because it s a siphon it ll also be sucking out water unplug the filter and any other equipment before siphoning to avoid damaging them they often don t run well when there s not enough water in the tank 14 x research source leave the fish in the tank while you re cleaning the bottom layer of the tank change 25 of the water out each week as you re using the gravel siphon watch the water level to make sure you re removing at least 25 of the water this water will be replaced with new fresh water after it s been treated with water conditioner of course make sure the old water isn t colder than the current water in the tank using a thermometer to help you test the temperature 15 x research source refer to the bottle of water conditioner to see how much you need to pour in to the bucket of new water stirring it using a fish net avoid removing more than 50 of the water from the tank because this messes with the ph levels too much after finishing the water change plug back in the filter and any other pieces of equipment change the filter when it starts looking dirty when you open up the top of the water filter pull the filter out to see if it s covered in dirt and grime if so it s time to change it another way to decide if it s time for a new filter is to look at the water flow if the water has slowed down the filter needs to be changed 16 x research source avoid changing the filter on the same day you change the water because this takes out too much beneficial bacteria,Pets-and-Animals
how to hang a bat house,during the summer months many bats build nests in trees beneath bridges or even inside buildings if you notice a lot of bats in your area or notice a lot of bugs you want bats to get rid of you may consider putting up a bat house for them to nest in choose a high location with a lot sun and build a mounting bracket from wood to hang your bat house,pick a spot within 1 500 feet 460 m of a body of water although bats can feed on any insects that fly around nearby they need a reliable source of water to live most bats will only fly 1 4 mile 0 40 km from a body of water to find a place to nest find a location with a river stream or even a pond nearby when picking somewhere to hang your bat house 1 x research source some species of bats may fly further to find somewhere to nest so an absence of water doesn t necessarily mean your bat house will go unused if you re determined to lure bats to your bat house make an artificial pond or another body of water in your yard to give the bats a reliable source of water choose a location that receives 6 to 8 hours of sunlight each day most bat houses will need 6 to 8 hours of sun each day in order to stay within the temperatures bats need to keep comfortable look for a location that faces east or south in an area that will be easily exposed to sun 2 x research source bats like temperatures between 85 to 100 f 29 to 38 c so try and maintain a temperature near this during the day if you paint your bat house a darker color such as black or a dark brown it will make it more efficient at absorbing and retaining heat if you live in a location that regularly exceeds temperatures of 100 f 38 c place the bat house somewhere it will get less sun or paint it a lighter color to reflect sunlight it is more important that the internal temperature of the house is 85 to 100 f 29 to 38 c than that it gets 6 to 8 hours of sunlight keep the house 20 to 30 feet 6 1 to 9 1 m from trees or bushes animals that prey on bats such as owls can perch in nearby trees and wait to catch bats as they enter or leave the house find a wall or a spot in your yard that s at least 20 feet 6 1 m from nearby trees to prevent animals from preying on the bat house 3 x research source as with the distance to water you don t need to measure out the distance from the trees to your bat house select a location 10 to 12 feet 3 0 to 3 7 m off of the ground bats will fly into the bat house from the bottom meaning you need to give them plenty of space to maneuver in pick a location on a wall of your home that is at least 10 feet 3 0 m off of the ground to hang your bat house 4 x research source putting the bat house high off the ground also helps prevent predators on the ground such as cats and dogs from being able to hunt the bats if you can t find a perfect location on a pre existing wall you can erect a post in your yard to hang the bat house from make sure to use a post that is 13 to 15 feet 4 0 to 4 6 m long so that it will still be at more than 10 to 12 feet 3 0 to 3 7 m high once one end is buried in the ground if you are using a wooden post wrap it with a piece of sheet metal 18 inches 46 cm high roughly 3 feet 0 91 m off of the ground this will stop predators from being able to climb the post avoid anywhere with artificial lighting bats are nocturnal meaning they ll nest in the bat house during the day and fly at night in order to avoid disturbing them during the day or confusing them when it s nighttime make sure the location you pick is away from any artificial lighting choose a location far away from street lamps or yard lights 5 x trustworthy source state of massachusetts official website for the state of massachusetts go to source measure the width of your bat house to plan the mounting brackets your mounting bracket will need to be wider than the bat house so that it can be attached to a wall as a rough guide measure the width of the bat house and add roughly 6 inches 15 cm to its length to find the required size of your brackets 6 x research source the excess wood on either end of your brackets needs to be drilled into something sturdy such as a stud in your wall you may need to add more than 6 inches 15 cm to ensure that you can drill through the bracket into something solid cut 2 pieces of 1 by 4 in 2 5 by 10 2 cm wood to length measure out 2 lengths of 1 by 4 in 2 5 by 10 2 cm wood to be the required size of your mounting brackets mark the length with a pencil and use a handsaw or something similar to cut through it this should create 2 evenly sized wooden mounting brackets 7 x research source the brackets do not need to be exactly the same length as long as they are bigger than the measurements you noted it is possible to mount the bat house with only 1 bracket but this will make it less secure and increase the chances of it falling when bats are inside mark 4 pilot holes evenly across the back of the bat house the pilot holes need to be evenly spaced and marked on the back edges of the side panels of the bat house so that the screws go into the sides rather than through the back paneling mark 2 points roughly 1 inch 2 5 cm from the top of the house on each edge mark a second point 2 inches 5 1 cm below it before repeating the same process near the bottom of the bat house 8 x research source you should have 2 sets of 4 pencil marks across the very edges of the back of your bat house these are the points that you will drill into to mount the house to your wall by drilling into the sides of the house rather than the back wall you ll prevent exposed screws from penetrating the inside of the house where bats will nest drill pilot holes into the bat house pilot holes ensure that the screws will go into the wood of the bat house safely and easily attach a 3 32 in 0 24 cm drill bit to an electric drill and use it to drill into the spots you marked on the back of the bat house 9 x research source as long as the size of the drill bit and therefore the size of the pilot hole is smaller than the screw you ll be using to mount the house your pilot holes will work perfectly copy the pilot holes to the middle of your wooden brackets measure the distances between each of the pilot holes you ve drilled into the back of the bat house use the same measurements to mark and drill pilot holes all the way through your wooden brackets so the two brackets can be placed over the bat house and the pilot holes will perfectly line up 10 x research source you should be able to look through each of the holes in each bracket and line it up with a hole on the bat house screw the wooden brackets onto the bat house place the 2 wooden brackets onto the back of the bat house so that the pilot holes are lined up use 8 1 1 2 in 3 8 cm wood screws to hold the 2 brackets to your bat house screwing them in and tightening them with a screwdriver 11 x research source use a wooden clamp to hold the brackets to the bat house while you work this will keep them from moving as you screw them in place use an adhesive caulk or something similar to hold the brackets in place while your screw in the wood screws to make sure everything holds firm attach the bat house to your wall with wood screws use a ladder and lift the bat house up to the section of your wall where you want to hang it get someone else to hold the house in place and use 8 2 in 5 1 cm wood screws to drill through the exposed edges of the wooden bracket into your wall use 2 screws on each length of the exposed bracket to hold the house securely 12 x research source for extra ease in screwing the house onto the wall drill some pilot holes in the exposed areas of the bracket first make sure your ladder is on even ground and that someone else is holding it while you hang the bat house cut a piece of 2 by 4 in 5 1 by 10 2 cm wood to the length of the bat house this will provide a flat surface that you can attach the bat house to rather than attempting to screw it directly onto the pole measure the height of the bat house and use a saw to cut a piece of 2 by 4 in 5 1 by 10 2 cm wood to length 13 x research source this will be used to build part of the mounting bracket it doesn t need to be exactly the right length as long as the other pieces of wood are attached at the right distance apart use lag bolts to attach the wood vertically near the post hold the piece of wood against the top end of the post so that it faces in the direction you want your bat house to face use 3 3 8 by 3 in 0 95 by 7 62 cm lag bolts or lag screws to attach the wooden mount to the face of the post screw them in until they are flush with the wood 14 x research source drill some pilot holes into the pre cut length of 2 by 4 in 5 1 by 10 2 cm wood to make inserting the lag bolts easier use an adhesive caulk or something similar to hold the wood in place while you screw in the lag bolts screw 1 lag bolt into the wood roughly 1 inch 2 5 cm from the top another 1 inch 2 5 cm below that and a final one 1 inch 2 5 cm from the bottom of the wood if you are attaching the mounts and the bat house to post that has already been erected you ll need to use a ladder to reach the top make sure the ladder is on even ground and someone holds it steady while you work cut 2 pieces of 2 by 4 in 5 1 by 10 2 cm to roughly the width of the bat house these two pieces of wood will be used to hold the bat house to the mount attached to the wooden post measure the width of the bat house and add 2 inches 5 1 cm use a handsaw to cut two pieces of 2 by 4 in 5 1 by 10 2 cm wood to this length 15 x research source as with the previous piece of wood these 2 mounts only need to be wider than the bat house don t worry too much if they are slightly longer or a little uneven screw the 2 lengths of wood onto the post mount with lag bolts position 1 piece of the pre cut wood so that it sits in front of and flush with the top of the post mount use a 3 8 by 3 in 0 95 by 7 62 cm lag bolt to attach the length of wood to the post mount making sure not to hit the lag bolt beneath it repeat with the other piece of wood so it is flush with the bottom of the mount 16 x research source the lag bolts should be affixed in the center of the lengths of wood so that an even amount of wood protrudes out from either side the wooden bracket should look like a capitalized letter i or a sideways h to make it easier drill pilot holes into the wood and the post mount before installing the lag bolts mark pilot holes along the back of the bat house the pilot holes need to be evenly spaced and marked on the back edges of the side panels of the bat house so that the screws go into the sides rather than through the back paneling use a pencil to mark 5 equidistant points along the top edge before repeating along the bottom edge of the bat house as well 17 x research source you should have 2 sets of 5 pencil marks spread along the back of the bat house make sure the other side of each mark is another piece of wood and that it doesn t go into the interior of the bat house if you drill into the interior of the house a bat might hurt itself on the sharp end of the screw drill pilot holes into the back of the bat house attach a 3 32 in 0 24 cm drill bit to the end of an electric drill place the drill over one of the pencil marks near the edge of the bat house and drill roughly 1 inch 2 5 cm into it to create a pilot hole repeat to make another 7 pilot holes excluding the 2 pencil marks made in the center of the bat house 18 x research source pilot holes drilled in the center of the bat house won t be accessible through the wooden mount or the post so they can be ignored these marks are only useful in spacing out the other pilot holes copy the pilot holes to the horizontal wooden brackets measure the distance between each of the pilot holes in the back of the bat house as well as their distance from the center working outwards from the center point of your 2 wooden brackets use the same measurements to copy mark and drill matching pilot holes all the way through the horizontal brackets 19 x research source use a 3 32 in 0 24 cm drill bit to make these pilot holes as well the 8 pilot holes on the back of the bat house should match up perfectly with the 8 pilot holes drilled in the wooden mounts secure the bat house to the wooden mounts with 3 in 7 6 cm deck screws position the bat house onto the wooden mount attached to the post and use several clamps to hold it in place working from behind the wooden mounts begin screwing 3 in 7 6 cm deck screws into each of the pilot holes to hold the bat house to the mounts 20 x research source make sure the screws are holding the bat house strongly and securely before removing the clamps with some rope and a few people to assist you could attach the bat house to the post before you erect the post itself mount the bat house put one end of the post into the ground and lift it up so the bat house is in the

how to care for a giant leopard moth caterpillar,a giant leopard moth caterpillar is a fuzzy black caterpillar with orange or red stripes while their bristles make the caterpillars look dangerous they re actually nonpoisonous and totally harmless caterpillars are a fun and unique pet and are perfect for children with proper care you can observe the life cycle and metamorphosis of your caterpillar into an adult leopard moth,find a large jar or flower pot nearly any container can be converted into a great caterpillar home as long as you are able to secure the caterpillar and provide it air holes since caterpillars can crawl up the sides it s important to have a cover for its home otherwise it ll crawl away 1 x research source if you have an aquarium or terrarium that allows air to flow through a lid made of screen netting then you can use it instead of a jar check to make sure that the entire aquarium or terrarium is secure so that your caterpillar won t escape create a breathable lid your caterpillar needs to breathe so use a porous material like cheesecloth as a lid make sure that your cheesecloth doesn t have holes that are big enough for the caterpillar to crawl through you can secure the cheesecloth to your jar or pot with a large rubberband 2 x research source if you don t have cheesecloth you can try using plastic wrap with plenty of holes poked in it don t use a metal jar lid because it can harm the caterpillar put a 2 3 inch layer of dirt into your jar or pot you can use dirt from your yard or generic potting soil if you find the caterpillar in nature collect dirt from the area the caterpillar is living 3 x research source don t take dirt from protected land such as natural parks add grass twigs and leaves make your caterpillar comfortable by incorporating bits of its natural habitat your caterpillar will appreciate having places to crawl and hide 4 x research source collect grass twigs and leaves from where you found the caterpillar do not put water into your caterpillar s home because it will drown change out the leaves regularly you need to change out your caterpillar s leaves daily or at least every other day because the leaves will decay if your caterpillar is on the old leaves put in the new leaves and wait for it to crawl onto the new leaves on its own once it s crawled over to the new leaves you can remove the old ones 5 x research source clean your caterpillar s home caterpillars produce a lot of waste called frass so you need to clean its home at least once a day to prevent mold or harm to your caterpillar 6 x research source use a paper towel to wipe the frass from the cage place your caterpillar s home outside if you want to follow your caterpillar s natural life cycle the place it on a porch balcony or in a garden if you have one note that placing a glass jar in full sun on a warm day for even a few minutes can cook your caterpillar so choose your outdoor location carefully 7 x research source keep your caterpillar warm the caterpillar will hibernate during the winter so a cold caterpillar will not be as active if you re keeping it inside your house consider putting it on a windowsill check your yard for caterpillar favorites if you found your caterpillar outside start looking there caterpillars have a preferred diet and they won t switch food sources just because that s what you give them if you want your caterpillar to thrive then you need to find the right plants 8 x research source giant leopard moth caterpillars enjoy munching leafy plants like dandelions violets honeysuckle citrus plants magnolias lilacs and broadleaf plantains 9 x research source if you don t find the plants in nature you can buy a small potted plant dandelions violets and lilacs should be available in pots from your local garden store check carefully for spiders and other insects spiders and other insects can prey upon your caterpillar so make sure that you don t accidentally put a predator into your new pet s home you may come back to find your caterpillar has been eaten 10 x research source place leaves from the plants inside your caterpillar s home at first monitor your caterpillar to make sure that you are feeding it enough leaves caterpillars spend most of their time eating so make sure that you meet your pet s needs 11 x research source feed your caterpillar daily if you accidentally pull off more leaves than you need you can keep them fresh by putting them in water and placing the container in the fridge remember not to put containers of water in your caterpillar s home because it will drown add a host plant if you have enough room in your caterpillar s home you can add a live plant for the caterpillar to eat this is only possible for smaller plants so look for one that will grow in a small pot like a dandelion 12 x research source wash your hands before you touch it caterpillars can pick up germs from your hands so make sure that you are clean before you handle it 13 x research source check on it at night giant leopard moth caterpillars are nocturnal so your caterpillar will be most active at night you can look for movement during the day but don t try to wake up the caterpillar if it s sleeping 14 x research source don t pull your caterpillar off of a surface caterpillars will hold onto what they re crawling on so don t try to remove your crawling critter it will hold onto the surface and may be hurt 15 x research source allow your caterpillar to hibernate in the wild giant leopard moth caterpillars hibernate all winter as part of their life cycle caterpillars can hibernate outside in their containers all winter or you can put it into the refrigerator don t freeze your caterpillar 16 x research source your caterpillar will not eat while it s hibernating but it may be lightly active on warmer days when it s mildly active it might eat available food add more food to your caterpillar s diet when your caterpillar wakes up in the spring it ll be ready to fatten up in preparation for its metamorphosis into a moth which will take place later in the spring make sure that you provide your caterpillar enough food for it to get ready to turn into a pupa which is its cocoon phase 17 x research source wait for your caterpillar to shed its exoskeleton your caterpillar s fuzzy skin will slide off once it has fattened up leaving a smooth black oval called a pupa this is it s cocoon phase you can expect it to shed its exoskeleton during spring 18 x research source check the pupa daily since you can t pinpoint the actual date of your moth s emergence keep track of its progress each day while your pupa does not need food you may want to mist the caterpillar s home daily to keep it humid simply spray a light spritz of water into the container 19 x research source while their actual time in the pupa can vary giant leopard moth caterpillars only take a few weeks to metamorphose into a moth watch your giant leopard moth emerge you can choose to keep your moth or set it free 20 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to distinguish between male and female fruit flies,fruit flies known scientifically as drosophila melanogaster are small flies usually found buzzing around ruined fruit 1 x research source though they can be a nuisance out in the open they are useful for science they are sometimes used to study how genes are passed from generation to generation 2 x research source in order to observe this process you need to be able to mate the flies mating is only possible if you can tell the difference between a male and a female,take stock of their usual color most fruit flies are a yellowish brown or tan color the presence of stripes indicates a female males do have a few stripes but these stripes meld together and become dark toward the back of the abdomen giving then a darker color 3 x research source these stripes actually appear as black rings differences in patterns of color are what many researchers use to determine the difference between male and female fruit flies 4 x research source for both genders their eyes are large and red they have five eyes and antennae look at how long the fly is the female fruit fly is longer than a male of the same species their abdomens are longer but not any other body part 5 x research source this makes females appear a bit larger than their male counterparts in other words when comparing two flies the smaller shorter fly is male 6 x research source notice whether it s pointed or blunt the abdomen of the female fruit fly is not only longer than that of the male fruit fly it is also pointed the male fruit fly abdomen is short and blunt therefore when you compare two fruit flies try to figure out which abdomen is pointed and which is blunt 7 x research source determine if the flies look different or not the fact is that extremely young flies have not yet developed many of the physical differences that are gender markers for adult flies if you re comparing two flies that look the same and you cannot determine if their body shapes or coloring are different you may need to look for other signs of gender 8 x research source look for a bristle on the forelegs find the two legs on the front half of the flies bodies these are their forelegs now look for a bristle also known as a sex comb this group of tiny dark hairs is only present on male fruit flies if the forelegs have no bristle it means you are holding a female 9 x research source use special equipment fruit flies are very tiny their average length is about 1 8 inch 0 3 cm or 3 mm 10 x research source in order to locate the tiny bristles on their legs you will need to immobilize the fly then use very delicate equipment to magnify the legs and identify a sex comb you may have to kill or freeze the fly to keep it still use a magnifying glass try placing the fly on white paper to make it easier to see its features note how females choose mates to further assist you in determining the sex of fruit flies it s helpful to know how they behave in general for example it is useful to note their mating habits so you can identify a male fruit fly by the way he behaves in a mating scenario female fruit flies choose a mate within 15 minutes they decide based on the way the male dances and brushes against the female s body 11 x research source when one fly is still while the other hops around like it is dancing this may be a mating ritual the male is the one moving be aware of their lifespan if you re studying fruit flies in a controlled environment in order to study gender differences it s good to know how long they will live fruit flies only live for 1 3 of a year or about four months they are very sensitive to temperature they can start reproducing within a week of being born producing hundreds of eggs at one time 12 x research source notice where they like to live you can find fruit flies buzzing with a buzz sound around rotting fruit they tend to lay their eggs in fruit that has just become ripe so that by the time the larvae hatch the fruit is rotten enough to produce the juices the flies need to survive 13 x research source their mouths are shaped for sucking up liquids making rotten fruit the perfect nest you may find more females around such fruit since they are the ones interested in laying eggs,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for a ferret,ferrets are popular pets due to their friendly and outgoing personalities curious by nature a ferret can provide hours of entertainment for their owner however they require a great deal of care and attention to keep a ferret as a pet you ll need to create a proper cage environment with a litter box food and water bowls and toys also taking your ferret to the vet on a yearly basis will ensure that it stays both healthy and happy,select a cage that is at least 18 x 18 x 30 this is enough room for a single ferret if you get another one then you ll need a slightly larger cage a wire cage works the best as ferrets have a tendency to chew through wooden bars some cages are bi level and come with specialty ramps and spots to attach a hammock 1 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source don t keep your ferret in an aquarium the solid sides prevent the flow of air and makes it a poor habitat for ferrets make sure that any cage that you select has a solid secure latch ferrets are accomplished escape artists and can lift latches unless they are complex line the floor of the cage with carpet walking on a wire floor can irritate your ferret s feet over time and even cause sores to develop cut down a piece of washable carpet to fit on the bottom of the cage this will give your ferret a soft cage surface if the carpet gets dirty simply pull it out and wash it 2 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source linoleum tiles are another cage flooring option cut them down to size as you would with carpet after you install the carpet watch your ferret for a few days to ensure that it doesn t try to chew on the fibers if this happens replace the carpet with tiles put a litter box into the cage look for a cardboard or plastic litter pan it should be about 3 to 5 inches 7 6 to 12 7 cm in height some litter pans come with small latches that you can use to attach it to the side of the cage ideally place the box in a spot away from your ferret s eating area 3 x research source fill the box with about 1 inch 2 5 cm of paper or plant pellets these are available at your local pet store the dust from regular litter can irritate your ferret s lungs clean your ferret s cage at least twice each week use a scooper to remove any soiled litter from the box pull out the cage carpet and wash it on a warm setting take out any hammocks or bedding and wash them as well wipe down any toys and the cage bars with a natural cleaner 4 x research source you can make a safe natural cleaning solution by adding some lemon juice or vinegar to water obtain suitable feeding containers you will need 2 bowls preferably stainless steel or ceramic 1 for food and 1 for water each dish should hold at least 8 ounces of food or water pet stores sell dishes that can be attached to the side of the cage to minimize spills it s also a good idea to install a water bottle that hangs from an interior wall of the cage 5 x research source wash the bowls and bottle with warm water and dish soap or run them through the dishwasher on a weekly basis this will help to keep algae from developing give your ferret a diet with both animal proteins and fats an ideal ferret diet will contain about 1 3rd or more animal proteins and about 1 4th healthy fats look for a quality dry ferret food that contains ingredients at these levels you can also talk with your vet about using high quality kitten food as well 6 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source ferrets enjoy small cut up snacks of cooked turkey cooked egg or chicken meat avoid giving your ferret fresh fruits or vegetables the sugars in fruits can irritate your ferret s digestive system and ferrets have been known to choke on raw vegetables keep in mind that ferrets need to eat about 8 to 10 times per day because they process food so quickly 7 x research source provide fresh water every day fill up your ferret s water bowl and bottle with room temperature water each day if the water is too cold then your ferret will stop drinking and could risk dehydration 8 x research source to tell whether your ferret is dehydrated pinch the skin on its scruff the back of its neck gently pull up and let go if it snaps back like the skin of the back of your hand does then your ferret is healthy if the skin takes a while to flatten or sticks up straight take your ferret to a vet for possible dehydration take your ferret for annual vet visits like most other animals ferrets need to be checked out by a vet at least yearly at these visits your vet will do a general physical check up of your ferret they will also ask you if your ferret has been suffering from any health or behavioral problems 9 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source your vet will keep your ferret on a standard vaccination schedule including yearly rabies shots many jurisdictions require these shots for domestic pets train your ferret to use the litter box watch to see where your ferret goes to the restroom when in the cage place the litter box in this same location then put a few fresh droppings into the box so that it smells like a restroom for your ferret most ferrets will quickly start using the box 10 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source if your ferret refuses to use the box then experiment with changing out the litter to another type of plant fiber hold your ferret with 2 hands at all times ferrets might seem like sturdy little creatures but they are actually quite fragile when you pick up or hold your ferret place 1 hand underneath its chest and use another to cup its hindquarters don t ever grab your ferret by its tail 11 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source you can also keep your ferret secure by using 1 hand to hold its hindquarters while using your other hand to gently grasp the scruff behind your ferret s neck speak in low soft tones to your ferret because of their acute sense of hearing you are likely to cause your ferret to panic if you raise your voice this can make them wiggle or even try to bite you if they are being held instead make a habit of using a calm soothing voice when interacting with your ferret this is a great way to build trust 12 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source give your ferret time outside of its cage when ferrets are awake they are extremely curious and interested in their surroundings let your ferret roam around a ferret proofed room or space for at least a few hours each day make sure that you supervise this time just in case your ferret gets into trouble 13 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source to make a space safe for your ferret check for any holes or gaps where it might hide or get stuck remove any medications or other substances which could poison your ferret put away small items such as remotes which if broken could constitute a choking hazard 14 x research source provide a variety of hard plastic toys both inside and outside the cage ferrets can chew through rubber or fabric toys quite easily whiffle golf balls baby rattles or even nylabones are safer options that last longer put 2 3 toys in your ferret s cage and have a few available in any play spaces as well 15 x research source inspect each toy every week and replace any that are torn or otherwise damaged wipe down toys with a clean wet rag about once per week as well play with your ferret for a minimum of 30 minutes each day ferrets are highly intelligent and thrive on human contact playing with your ferret can be as simple as gently rolling a few plastic balls in front of it or you can get more elaborate and teach your ferret to come when called roll over or even fetch 16 x research source the key to teaching tricks to your ferret is repetition repeat the same request over and over again providing treats such as cooked chicken pieces when your ferret gets it right monitor all interactions with children and other pets most ferrets have a friendly personality but they can bite if they feel threatened or if they believe that you are offering them food for those reasons it s best if you hold the ferret when children are around it s also a good idea to limit the interactions between ferrets and other family pets such as cats or dogs because ferrets have such fragile bones even a small dog can easily cause them injury bathe your ferret once every 6 months or annually you can also wait to bathe your ferret until it is dirty due to a spill or illness bathing your ferret too often can dry out its skin and prompt over activated stink glands which can cause even more ferret smell use ferret shampoo which can be found at a pet store your ferret s coat is important to its health if its coat is soft full and doesn t have an unusually smelly odor then your ferret is healthy,Pets-and-Animals
how to build a livestock fence,livestock fencing is dependent on the type of livestock you intend to keep inside the fence there are many types of fence that will control livestock this article provides a simple brief overview of typical livestock fencing please feel free to start an article on any particular type of fencing by type or by livestock,determine or know what livestock you own or will potentially have to help you consider what your fencing needs will be most fences are suited for a variety of farm animal species but ideally you shouldn t waste money on building something that will end up being what you don t need or is not enough to hold in the animals you are wanting to keep for example you shouldn t put up chicken wire if you re only going to have cattle nor should you install cattle panels for chickens goats or pigs chicken wire is best for chickens and other poultry and other small stock and cattle panels are best for cattle and horses with that in mind you must also understand the risks of having a particular individual animal that may be more of a houdini than the rest which should be encouragement enough to make sure you make your fences goat tight and bull strong 1 x research source goats are notorious for testing fences being prone to climb up jump over crawl under crawl through or even walk through fences build your fence so that it s tall enough that they are not likely to jump over and in the ground enough that they won t crawl under the space between wires need to be smaller than the size of their heads because if a goat can get its head through then the rest of its body is sure to follow 2 x research source sheep are less notorious for testing fences yet are as small as goats thus similar fencing requirements are required for this domestic species 3 x research source pigs are worse for digging under and crawling under fences than going over them you will need to install fencing that is deep enough underground that pigs won t root too far underneath to escape 4 x research source many horse owners will argue that barbed wire fencing is the worse thing for horses to be contained in and would rather spend the extra money on rail or board fencing than wire fencing horses are much more apt to jump over a fence and figure out a way through the gate latch than crawling under or through a fence however a stallion hot on the trail of a mare in heat will test a fence to its limits thus if you own a breeding herd of horses make sure the corral you are containing your corrals in is strong sturdy and tall enough a stallion won t test it 5 x trustworthy source penn state extension educational organization dedicated to delivering science based information to people businesses and communities go to source fencing for cattle is a little more easier to choose because there are more choices a producer can make for holding their cattle in depending on where a producer wants to hold them in barbed wire fencing is the most common type of fencing for pasturing cattle electric fencing is best for those fence lines that are being tested too much or those who are rotational grazing cattle more rugged fencing such as stand alone iron panels wood board or iron rail is best for corrals handling facilities and working or holding pens and highly recommended for bull and cull cow pens 6 x research source determine what type of fence or fences that needs to be built once you know what kind of livestock you will have to contain and what needs to be done to keep them in ultimately what you choose depends on how much money you are willing to spend to buy the supplies and how long the fence line needs to be or what perimeter or area needs to be contained with a surrounding fence note that there is a huge difference in fences for corrals versus those for pasture with cattle for example corral fences need to be tougher and stable than pasture fences pasture fencing for cattle require simple barbed wire or high tensile fences whereas for pigs goats and sheep pasture fencing requires page wire up to a 3 to 5 feet 0 9 to 1 5 m tall respectively pasture fencing for horses can also be barbed wire or high tensile but others like to get a little more fancy and have painted wood fences or aesthetically pleasing iron fencing there are numerous types of fencing available some examples include 7 x trustworthy source university of georgia cooperative extension division of the university of georgia focused on research and community education go to source temporary electric fencing in the form of permanent such as high tensile or temporary electric electric fencing can be the fastest and cheapest to build if you live in the country it will handle any animal that is trained to the wire and is also useful as a psychological barrier to even wildlife wire that is electrified is said to be energized or hot temporary electric is perfect for rotational or managed intensive grazing because it can be moved around all the time how to install an electric fence will not be covered here because some different techniques are involved with installation of this compared with building a standard permanent livestock fence however please see how to make an electric fence for more information barbed wire fencing with barbed wire installed alone in four to six or more wired fences smooth wire fence in the form of high tensile or low tensile fencing this type of fencing is often electrified or a combination of smooth and barbed wire one strand of barbed wire usually runs across top and sometimes at differing levels or one strand of smooth wire runs across the top with the bottom wires barbed both types are fencing are best for livestock paige wire though more expensive than barbed or smooth wire is best for operations that pasture or raise goats sheep and pigs and is a common pasture fencing for holding bison and elk paige wire may also be used on farms or ranches that run a cow calf operation and necessitates use if the producer doesn t want their calves out of the corral paige wire is also called farm fence or woven wire and comes in the form of woven chicken wire or 12 to 14 gauge wire welded together to form squares of varying lengths apart from four to six inches apart it can stand as low as three feet or as tall as eight feet wooden horse railing or wooden boards are best for those who want more aesthetically pleasing farms and don t want to worry about the potential problems posed by wire fences it can be expensive but safe and effective for horses wooden board fencing is also suitable for holding cattle iron railing fencing is also suited for farms that have horses or wish to have aesthetically pleasing yards it can also be used for other livestock like cattle and sheep especially in high traffic areas such as holding corrals or sacrifice corrals iron panel fencing comes in panels that need to be stabilized with wooden posts or stand alone panels that simply require a tractor to put them into place these depending on the size are great for keeping large animals such as deer cattle especially bulls horses including stallions bison and even elk obtain a survey of your land a legal land survey may be required to determine the exact perimeter of the land that you own or where your land ends and your neighbor s begins you may need to arrange for this first since a wait may be involved note this is crucial for determining where your permanent fences are going to go especially if you have land that is not already surrounded by existing boundaries such as a road or a tree line it is less important if you are building internal fences within the base perimeter fence because quite often you can survey out where these internal fences will go yourself rather than spend money to hire professional surveyors to do it for you surveying out internal pasture and corral fences require quite a bit of measuring and making sure you have corners that are close to 90 degrees and not at an obtuse or acute angle that your animals will find and get themselves cornered in use surveyor stakes also called lath surveyor tape a 200 tape measure and chalk or marking paint with the latter two items ideal for marking out small working corrals and handling facilities you will need to use these items after you ve completed the step after this next one phone the utility and gas company to mark out any underground utility and pipe lines that may be on your property they will come out and put up stakes and or bright spray paint to note where any hidden lines may be that you should be aware of prior to starting any fence building be sure you know where utility gas lines go before you dig or start pounding in fence posts because if you don t you will either have the costly endeavor of having it fixed or you could be end up in the er of the local hospital determine where your fences are going to go on paper you will need a ruler a protractor a pencil paper and an eraser to create a drawing to help you figure out an efficient system of movement from pasture to pasture pasture to corral corral to pasture and corral to handling area especially for pasture rotations you must design a system that reduces or eliminates risk of returning to a pasture that has just been grazed and requires rest and be organized so that you are going to have smooth flow of traffic from one pasture or corral to another the land survey done will help you out with your planning especially if you can acquire a copy of a surveyor s map of your land finding your land on google earth may help as well especially to give you a better idea of how much land you need to cover and what the estimated measurements of your fence lines will be you then can sketch out your pasture and corral spaces noting the following how many enclosures you want to have for pastures this all depends on the grazing system you want to have and whether you want just a permanent perimeter fence so that you can have movable fencing for a rotational grazing system where your gates should be remember you need to have good flow for most livestock movement is smoother and it s easier to herd them if a gate is put in the corner of a pasture rather than in the middle of the fence line this is because most animals that can be herded as a group almost all species of livestock except pigs and chickens often always go to a corner rather than a fence where any high traffic lanes may be optional these are good if you need to divert animals away from a farmed field a residence or a protected natural area in moving them to another pasture lanes may be good if you have water facilities out on pasture as well as several pastures that are rotated throughout the year and this one water source is sufficient for all moves length of each fence line noting how much land area you have and the perimeter of your land base via the surveying results this will help you calculate out how much wire and how many posts will be needed length of gates and how many for example if you need two 10 foot gates or only one 16 foot gate keep in mind space needed for potentially having equipment come into the pasture for various reasons from reseeding pastures mowing or haying excess forages 8 x research source to spreading manure or even collecting a dead animal like a cow for disposal plan out what kind of corner braces you want or need for your pasture fences this is your anchor point for your fence that takes the brunt of the force generated by both lines of the fence that the corner brace is connected to and is the first and most important thing you need to build for a pasture livestock fence you might want to search around your area for these corner braces when you go driving around you will find all manner of corners out there for you to observe which have held up over the years to various degrees considering the value that a fence has it makes sense to build your corner assemblies up to the highest standard in your area 9 x research source corner braces range from an h brace n brace or a brace with a wood post at the top and wire stretching from the top of one post down to the bottom of the other in other words when two h braces back to back which are commonly seen on a pasture fence corner three vertical posts two horizontal braces and bracing wire are used to construct such a corner brace this type of construction is standard and will hold up almost any fence for many years to come mark out all of your fence lines corners lanes and gates using surveyor tape lath a long tape measure chalk or bright paint measure out where your fence lines will go where your corner braces will be any lanes you will have and where your gates will go mark out where you will need to sink posts in to first start forming corner braces the chalk and paint are ideal for smaller areas like laying out a handling facility and pointing where corner posts will need to go lath with surveyor tape tied work the best as reference points to where corners will be and where corner posts will need to be pounded in to use all as best as possible so that when you come back with your supplies you won t be confused as to where to begin or where your fence line should actually be note what color of surveyor tape or painted lath the gas company and or surveyors used to mark out the buried utility lines and avoid using that color to avoid confusion and a potential mishap purchase your fencing supplies you will need quite a number of items fence posts treated wood metal or metal t posts both with the tapered ends and some that have no tapered ends for use as top bracing posts on corner braces barbed smooth or paige wire or boards or rails depending on what kind of fence you have settled on for wire fences especially all wire comes in rolls so you will need to build a contraption that allows the spool of wire to freely spin when you pull it along and unroll a strand of wire along the fence line all without you having to hold the very heavy new spool most new spools of barbed wire weigh around 70 pounds 31 8 kg to 90 pounds 40 8 kg which is not easy to carry for most people who have a lot of fence to build and walk along to unroll it start with a metal or iron rod or pole that easily fits in the center of the spool then go from there with any spare wood or metal parts you find that you can hammer or weld together note though that iron or metal parts tend to be more durable than wood even when a wooden spool holder is held together by screws there are all sorts of inventions many producers have created that has worked for them from truck mounted holders to tractor loader holders all with the same purpose allow the spool to spin freely on its center axis so that it can be more easily unrolled simply type in barb wire spool holder to your favorite search engine and be prepared to be inspired by the search results a ratcheting come along wire stretcher hand held or operated from a vehicle the latter ideal for wire fences longer than 20 feet 6 1 m or 30 feet 9 1 m long fencing pliers a hammer if you don t already have a good heavy duty one nails 6 to 8 inches 15 2 to 20 3 cm spiral or ringed nails for putting up board or rails and corner posts or fencing staples come various sizes depending on the size of wire you are putting up most common small sizes are usually 1 25 inches 3 2 cm and the common large sizes are 2 5 inches 6 4 cm a heavy mallet optional though useful for putting in corner braces and maybe pounding in some fence posts a post pounder rented from your local farm supply store and a chainsaw or hand saw if you don t already have either for sawing the tops of bracing posts and pounded posts used for forming the stabilizing corners of your fences dig holes 10 x research source an auger or post hole digger is used to dig any holes that are required especially for the start of constructing corner braces the posts are buried in a hole that is as deep as is necessary in your area depending on the type of soil you have corner brace posts need to be dug so that the base is sunk in at least 30 inches 76 2 cm to 2 feet 0 6 m deep install corner posts 11 x research source corner posts are usually larger in diameter and even longer than line posts some people choose to set them in concrete however others argue that setting them in concrete will make them more prone to rot than if they were set in gravel sand or the soil they are to be set in make sure they are straight and level it is never good to have crooked corner posts before installing the top post connecting all three sunken posts fill in the space around the three posts with the soil that was dug out gravel sand or concrete if you so choose you should have a an approximate right 90 degree angle formed between the post that is standing at the very center point of the corner of your fence and the other two on either side connect the bracing horizontal posts with the three posts use a tape measure a pencil and a chainsaw to mark and cut out the points where the posts are to meet and be very snug with each other you may need to use a mallet to fully connect the top post with the sunken in posts for constructing h corners with a bracing wire place the blunt end post on top of the two standing posts and mark the top portion that needs to be removed on the standing posts and mark the portion at either end of the brace along the curved side not the flat side that will also need to be removed allow for 6 inches 15 2 cm to be cut down into the post before removing the length marked out at a 90 degree angle you should end up with a right angle cut into the standing posts and the same at either end of the bracing post the cuts facing each other directly on the standing posts and one the same side of the bracing post do not remove more than what is marked rather right on the mark or slightly less to allow for a more snug fit of the bracing post place the bracing post over the cuts and hammer in the ends trying to do both at the same time or rather not first working on getting one end all the way in before trying the other as mentioned use a mallet if the braces are too tight to use with a hammer hammer in a couple nails into the end of the bracing post to keep it in place install the brace wire the brace wire crosses from the top of one post down to the other and tightening that wire with a stick by winding the wire up as tight as possible without breaking it further enhances the strength of the cross brace direction of where the brace wire is located is really important the wire should be looped around the top of the very middle corner brace and sloped down to the post on the outside of the corner smooth galvanized wire is highly recommended with four to five loops between each posts then twisted direction of twist is up to you hammer in two or three staples over the wire on each of the standing posts to secure it repeat with the other side of the corner and repeat this step with all other corners note that with board or rail fences installing corner braces is not required even hot wire temporary fences do not require permanent corner braces put up the first line of fencing wire this is to act as a guide to where to sink the line posts in with the post pounder the first wire should be around 8 to 10 inches 20 3 to 25 4 cm off the ground this step is usually not necessary for board or rail fences nor temporary electric fences put up line posts line posts or fence posts mentioned above must be set at regular intervals this distance varies widely from fence to fence and can range from as close as 6 feet 1 8 m apart and as far as 50 feet 15 2 m apart closer is better if finances allow and is a necessity if you are building holding or working corrals that will take a lot of abuse from the animals herded in them all of the line posts you use that are would should be treated posts no exceptions should be made because untreated wood posts have a much shorter life span than those that have been chemically pressure treated these same posts should taper at the end which makes it easier for the post pounder to drive them into the ground ideally line posts should be sunk in 14 to 18 inches 35 6 to 45 7 cm deep regardless of terrain more posts will be needed for more uneven terrain such as the edge of a hill or into a valley put up the rest of the wires you will need to judge how many strands you want especially for wire fences the standard is four wires per fence line especially for barbed wire fencing but some producers prefer to install five or six wire fences especially along roads make sure each wire is evenly spaced with the other this is also part of what makes a fence strong and sturdy if the wires are not evenly spaced it makes it easy for an animal to put its head through the fence or even be able to go right through or under the fence without any problems you must make it difficult for this to happen for board to rail fences the standard is three board or rails one on top of the other and evenly spaced per fence line hammer in the staples each line post will need to be connected to the wires strung up by staples this is important because livestock will find a hole in the fence and a hole can be a wire that is not connected to a post with a fence staple or a wire that has been broken from too much pressure exerted on it the staple should be hammered in at an angle to the wire never perfectly perpendicular and the loop slightly pointing up it takes a lot of practice to get good at hammering staples in so they look nice and neat they are not like hammering nails because the two pointed ends allow for a lot more give than a single spiked nail each blow to the staple must be right on ideally blows happening so that the angle of the hammer head is next to perfectly perpendicular to the angle of the post so that it won t angle up too much into the wood or bend so much that the staple gets so flat it needs to be replaced also when first attempting to hammer you may miss it so that the staple goes flying off somewhere in the grass and gets lost forever check the perimeter of the fence line to see if you missed any staples or anything else that may be amiss repeat the steps above for the rest of the fences you need to build let the animals out to the pasture once you are done building the fences you can finally let your animals out to pasture keep an eye on them for an hour or so as they wander the perimeter of their new pasture to see if they find a hole to go through if there s no problems then you re good to go,Pets-and-Animals
how to catch small bugs,catching small bugs can seem like an exercise in futility they are everywhere but as soon as you try to focus on them they dart into impossible to reach corners or underground small bugs are everywhere and if you know where to look and what basic traps to lay you can grow your collection quickly,look under rocks and logs to uncover small insects of every kind bugs love dark humid spots head to the nearest stream or simply start turning over rotting logs rocks and other low lying hiding spots you can catch a large variety of insects this way as long as you re quick in damp loose soil just dig 6 8 under the surface to reveal a plethora of insects a net or garden shovel will make it much easier to get multiple insects at once for delicate bugs like mantises consider using tweezers to keep them safe and intact while collecting 1 x research source break apart rotting wood to search for termites and insect larva the snug relative protection of dead wood is a great place to go searching while not necessary gloves and long sleeves are generally recommended to protect your skin from splinters or nasty moldy bits of wood 2 x research source always treat your environment with respect breaking apart insect habitats should only be done if you need the bugs for research or survival not purely for fun snatch bugs out of the air with a net though make sure you have the right one for the job flying insects like ladybugs and moths are tough to capture unless you have a net if you re trying to save the bugs such as for a collection make sure that you have a net with a thin light mesh protecting valuable parts like wings and antennae sweep nets are solid and are made for insects in bushes trees and long grass you can use a pillowcase attached to a pole or branch to make your own butterfly nets are much thinner and are only for aerial insects if you want to make your own purchase some light mesh from your local craft store 3 x research source craft a stunning stick if you don t have a net and aren t worried about keeping the insects in pristine condition you can also use a stunning stick get a big stick with its large leafy end still intact then walking in tall grass use the wide leaves and branches at the end to knock bugs out of the air stunning them temporarily think of it as a large flyswatter 4 x research source use a net or even a kitchen colander to harvest insects from streams slowly moving or stagnant water is a treasure trove for small insects using some sort of strainer skim the top 1 2 of the water to pull out all sorts of mayflies water skimmers and even dragonflies a net especially one with a long reach is almost always your best bet in a pinch such as a survival setting you can make a net with two poles and a shirt tie the shirt between the sticks and sweep it across the water once you have something bring the sticks together to circle the net around your prey 5 x research source catch ants with a simple stick and some patience you ll want gloves for this especially if you are unsure if the bugs bite simply jam a long stick into the mound and wait as they panic at the intrusion ants will climb up the stick in a frenzy once it is filled with as many as you want pull the stick off and use your fingers to slide the ants into a bowl for safe keeping bright red ants are usually the most dangerous so collect with caution 6 x research source use the right bait to get the right insects the following traps can all be improved by using bait most bait is simple sugar and yeast in the form of rotting fruit sugar water corn syrup or alcohol while most traps will get a few insects without it insect bait will significantly improve your collection overripe fruit fermented foods like beer soaked bread peanut butter and sugar will attract many insects rotten meat will attract carrion like maggots and flies a mixture or fruit rum or beer and sugar will attract many nocturnal insects if you re serious about collecting insects you can buy pheromones online or in major garden stores to attract males insects 7 x research source make a basic pitfall trap simple and effective all you need is a plastic jar like a peanut butter jar or a soup can punch 4 5 holes in the bottom of your can dig up a hole the size of your can then put the trap in so that the top of the can is even with ground level fill the trap with some dirt leaves and bait optional then wait for non flying bugs to fall right in 8 x research source make a funnel with an old plastic bottle to trap flying insects a funnel trap requires little more than some scissors knife and an old bottle to make one start with a soda bottle while one liter is usually the easiest to work with anything will do note however that this trap is not very effective in the rain to make one cut the top of the bottle off starting just where it begins to taper in towards the cap discard the cap cutting off the small neck of the bottle turn the tapered end that you just cut off upside down and place it in the bottle forming a funnel adhere with tape if needed place bait at the bottom of the trap and wait bugs fly into the funnel but use the walls to escape making it impossible to leave again through the center hole 9 x research source try a side door type trap this trap though it seems simple will capture a fair amount of insects especially when used with bait all it requires is a plastic bottle and a sharp knife cut a small u in the side of the bottle with the uncut side nearest to the cap pull the flap upward so that there is an opening in the bottle shielded by the door place bait in the bottom of the bottle and wait most insects cannot find the door to get out especially if you use sticky bait like sugar water or corn syrup this trap is effective in the rain as the door prevents water from getting in 10 x research source make homemade sticky paper to catch flies and other small bugs you can make your own flypaper with ease insects will be attracted to the sweet smell but unable to free themselves after landing you can place the traps on the ground though they are more effective when hung take an old paper bag or piece of cardboard and lightly wipe the surface clean mix equal parts sugar water and corn syrup on the stove until blended cool the sugar mixture for a few minutes spread the paste on the bag or cardboard to finish the trap 11 x research source create a beat sheet to get lots of insects from bushes or small trees the idea is simple you place a collection device a pan inverted umbrella box old sheet etc under a tree or bush then you shake it you can then collect the bugs that fall out with your hands or tweezers 12 x research source this works best on smaller trees or locations you know that there are a lot of small flightless bugs,Pets-and-Animals

how to care for a new pet rabbit,getting a new pet rabbit can be fun but it s important to understand that a rabbit needs time to adjust to its new home it s your job to make sure that your rabbit has everything it needs to make that adjustment as smooth as possible the decisions you make at this early stage in your lives together can set the tone for the future relationship you have with your rabbit,decide whether your rabbit will live inside or outside before bringing your new pet home you need to decide if you intend the bunny to be a house rabbit or live outdoors in a run in the yard house rabbits are popular pets but there are a few factors to consider while you will have to do more cleaning and training for a rabbit that lives indoors with you you will not have as much social contact with a rabbit that lives outside if you decide to keep your rabbit inside you will need to rabbit proof your house rabbits chew anything and everything including electrical cables and the legs of your antique furniture make sure you are able to rabbit proof your home so that cables are all tidied away out of reach of the rabbit and there is no item that you would be upset if it got damaged by gnawing if you decide to keep your rabbit inside you will also need to litter box train it it is not hygienic to have the rabbit ranging around the house pooping and peeing wherever they please the solution is to litter train the rabbit to use a litter box however most rabbits poop mostly in one particular spot so you can use this to your advantage by placing a litter tray in whichever spot they usually poop if you have a male rabbit who is spraying urine everywhere you may need to get him desexed if you decide to keep your rabbit outside you will need to commit to spending time socializing it every day make it a part of your schedule otherwise the rabbit may become anxious and fearful in your company get a rabbit hutch the hutch or rabbit house should be at least 2 feet 0 61 m wide and 4 feet long and tall enough to let the rabbit stand up to its full height the bottom of the cage should not be made of wire but the sides can be outdoor hutches are most commonly made of wood with a door fitted at the front made of chicken wire this allows for good ventilation and for the rabbit to see out the wood offers a degree of thermal protection to insulate the rabbit from the elements and is sturdy protecting the rabbit from predators an outdoor hutch will need to have a run attached to it so that your rabbit can exercise the run should be a minimum of 4 feet 1 2 m by 8 ft by 2ft tall for a rabbit under 2kg 1 x research source many indoor hutches are made of plastic with a wire roof this has the advantage of being lightweight so you can move it around the house easily if you can t find a hutch you like make your own it isn t as simple as buying one but it can be much better for your rabbit cover the bottom of the hutch with bedding you must provide bedding that is soft warm and absorbent cover the entire base to a minimum depth of 3 4 inches 7 6 10 cm this cushions the backs of the rabbit s hind legs which are prone to pressure sores if not enough padding is provided commonly used substrates for bedding include wood chips hay or straw of these straw is the warmest and softest and makes the best bedding material hay is second best and is more expensive than straw and sawdust it third best 2 x research source textbook of rabbit medicine frances harcourt brown publisher butterworth heinneman get a litter tray you will need to litter train your rabbit if you are keeping it inside the litter tray will need to fit inside the hutch and not take up more than a third of the floor space transfer your rabbit carefully from its carrier to its hutch rabbits are a prey species which means when they are stressed they want to hide moving home is a big deal for a bunny and so when you bring them home leave them in the quiet to settle in leave the rabbit undisturbed for 24 hours this will help it grow accustomed to the new sights sounds and smells of their new home without the added challenge of strange people staring at them start interacting with your rabbit after 24 hours take it slowly spend as long as time allows each day sitting beside the hutch talking to the rabbit if the rabbit is already tame then open the hutch door and stroke along the rabbit s back avoid hovering your hand over the rabbit s head as this is what a predator would do try picking up the rabbit carefully if the rabbit doesn t run away when you gently pet it then sit on the ground and gently lift rabbit out and onto your lap sitting on the ground is less frightening to bunny because they are ground dwelling and being high in the air is unnerving for them 3 x research source textbook of rabbit medicine frances harcourt brown publisher butterworth heinneman to pick up your rabbit place a hand on its chest and another on its bottom and carefully lift it so that its side is parallel to your chest and it is sitting on one of your arms while the other forms a barrier so it can t fall off then place it on your lap if the rabbit is not used to being picked up and runs away do not forcibly remove the rabbit instead take your time and tempt the rabbit out with an extra tasty treat once the rabbit gets used to your voice and realises you are no threat it will eventually go for the treat once bunny is regularly staying out to receive the treat you can start to stroke their back once they accept this at that stage you can try to pick bunny up remember rabbits are prey animals unlike dogs or cats their mothers do not carry them so the only situation in the wild in which they would be picked up would be when a predator was carrying them some rabbits just don t like being picked up so if your rabbit won t let you pick it up leave it be groom your rabbit grooming your rabbit is another great way to bond use a comb and a soft brush and once bunny is happy being stroked use the brush to groom it this is another good way to teach rabbit your company is a good thing and perhaps try this first if the rabbit is still skittish about being picked up ask the previous owner what the rabbit ate in the short term offer the rabbit that same food too many changes at once are likely to upset the rabbit and food is one thing you can keep constant at least for a few days as the rabbit gets more confident if its diet is not ideal start to change its food know what to feed your rabbit rabbits are herbivorous and their ideal food is growing grass grass provides the correct balance of nutrients and fiber which grinds down their teeth and gets their gut to work however it s not possible to provide good quality growing grass all year round especially for an indoor rabbit so a compromise always has to be reached the best food for your rabbit is growing grass but you will most likely need to supplement the grass with other foods fresh green hay is the best alternative to grass if feeding pellets only offer small amounts the rest of the diet should be hay know what foods to avoid giving your rabbit just because rabbits are herbivores doesn t mean that they should be eating any plant based diet try to avoid muesli type feeds these are far from ideal and avoid using if at all possible a muesli food has identifiable ingredients such as squashed peas corn wheat nuts and biscuit the problem is the rabbit will eat the tasty bits and leave the nutritious parts this leads to weak bones and overgrown teeth and the rabbits also tend to become overweight it is an old wives tale that rabbit s under 6 months of age should not get fresh greens and vegetables the trick is to give in moderation as a daily treat small pieces of fruit may be given on occasion but should be strictly limited due to their high sugar content all new foods should be introduced slowly over time if any digestive upset is noticed offer the rabbit unlimited water unlimited hay and some old fashioned long cooking oats remove all other types of food and restrict the rabbit to this diet for three days if the digestion has returned to normal you may reintroduce other foods again slowly one at a time also any food can potentially cause problems if eaten to excess carrots contain a lot of oxalate and if given everyday can predispose the rabbit to bladder stones a safe way to feed vegetables is to never give the same thing two days in a row thus you may give cucumber monday red pepper tuesday carrot wednesday broccoli thursday and so on 4 x research source textbook of rabbit medicine frances harcourt brown publisher butterworth heinneman don t overfeed your rabbit find out how much food your rabbit needs based on its weight and breed you must feed them every day but do not feed too much based on their weight if you have a big or standard size rabbit and you are feeding them grass you have to feed them a lot making sure they get enough calories every day which means they are eating almost constantly if you are feeding your rabbit pellets they will get enough calories much faster in as little as 20 minutes try to be consistent with the times of day you feed them provide fresh drinking water at all times use a clean algae free container mix up water with apple cider vinegar the cloudy type is best for your rabbit add two capfuls of vinegar to one gallon and use that to fill your rabbit s water container the apple cider vinegar provides many health benefits for the rabbit such as shiny coat boosts the immune system and helps to maintain healthy intestinal bacteria rabbit sipper bottles are a good idea because the water is held in a reservoir attached to the hutch and does not get contaminated by bedding food or pellets that may get kicked into a bowl of water likewise bowls of water are prone to being tipped over which could be disastrous on a hot day if the rabbit is left with nothing to drink if your rabbit prefers drinking from a bowl get a heavy one that they cannot tip if your rabbit lives outside in the winter you should get a heated water bottle so their water supply does not freeze let your rabbit out while you are home if you have an indoor rabbit a house rabbit gets a good dose of both exercise and mental stimulation especially if it is allowed out when you are home let the rabbit be free to follow you around and even watch tv with you take your rabbit outside if you have an indoor rabbit take it outside but be sure it cannot escape if you have an outdoor rabbit let it out into the yard once in a while your outdoor hutch should have a run attached to it so your rabbit can exercise when it wants but you will get more interaction with it if you let the rabbit out in the yard to play with you and to get some training never leave your rabbit alone outside birds could snatch away your precious bunny you can even purchase a rabbit harness and leash so you can take your rabbit for a hop around the block spend time with the rabbit do activities such as grooming or training or just spend time playing with it rabbits are slow learners but you can teach them simple tricks and they can be clicker trained provide your rabbit with toys they love to be playful rabbits are also active and curious and need a good or wide variety of toys to keep them occupied and out of mischief you can use cardboard boxes of all shapes and sizes as toys a great free toy is a toilet paper roll stuffed with hay after the toilet paper has been used up of course most rabbits love this toy it gives them something to toss around gnaw and a snack it s also a great way to recycle cat toys often make good rabbit toys a small plastic ball with a bell inside is usually fun for them to push around another idea is the type of baby rattle made like a keyring rabbits love to toss them around and shake them remember that rabbits will gnaw anything they can reach check toys every day and remove anything that seems like it might become unsafe most unpainted unvarnished wood is safe for rabbits to chew as are paper products such as cardboard but always use common sense check items for things which might cause problems such as staples glue paint varnish glossy labels etc and remove any plastic toys the rabbit has managed to gnaw small pieces from clean and change the bedding in the litter box frequently rabbit droppings are very dry and round so they aren t hard to clean up try to put a little bit of hay into the litter box because rabbits like to eat while they use the bathroom this encourages them to keep going to the litter box don t wait too long to clean the cage it will get disgusting smelly and is not good for your rabbit s health get your rabbit neutered neutered rabbits make better pets as they are less territorial and less prone to aggression rabbits can be desexed from around 12 weeks of age if you have more than one rabbit of either sex then this young age is strongly advised or you may have a rabbit population explosion on your hands 5 x research source textbook of rabbit medicine frances harcourt brown publisher butterworth heinneman get your rabbit vaccinated from 12 weeks of age rabbit s can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and viral hemorrhagic diarrhea both diseases are fatal to rabbits one annual injection is all it takes to keep the rabbit protected 6 x research source textbook of rabbit medicine frances harcourt brown publisher butterworth heinneman also speak to your vet about a course of fenbendazole against a common rabbit parasite called encephalitozoon cuniculi a high percentage of rabbits carry this parasite which can cause neurological problems kidney failure or blindness in later life a single course once a year is advisable to keep your pet safe do not bathe your rabbit there is no need to give a rabbit a bath as they clean themselves frequently and the oil on their bodies is natural not harmful water can get in their ears and their ears can get infected also the stress of a bath can be very bad for your rabbit s health rabbits are very clean animals and should never need a bath if your rabbit gets a messy bottom this is often the result of a problem watery poop is fatal to rabbits if your rabbit has watery poop you must seek emergency medical treatment immediately clumpy poo on the bunny s bottom may be the sign of too rich a diet or a rabbit who has become too chunky to properly clean itself in this case it is fine and important to give a bunny butt bath this should be done very gently with just a few inches of lukewarm water set the bunny s bottom only in the water and use your hand to gently loosen and clean the clumpy mess once clean remove and thoroughly dry the bunny it is extremely important to address whatever caused the clumpy poo restrict food to unlimited hay and some oats for three days in the case of a very chunky rabbit make sure the rabbit is getting plenty of exercise rabbits were not designed to sit

how to breed a pet snail,do you keep pet snails as a hobby or you just want an easy to care pet do you want to raise the population of your snails but without capturing wild ones great here is a step by step guide on how to breed pet snails,make sure you are ready to care for the baby snails this includes getting a new terrarium and being ready to provide extra attention and a little more time to the task be informed about mating most snails are hermaphrodites meaning they have both male and female sex organs after laying a clutch of eggs snails are generally ready to reproduce again in six weeks throughout the year snails lay between 30 and 140 eggs at a time that s nearly 480 snails a year 1 x research source the mating of two snails is possible but extremely painful for both snails so it s not necessarily encouraged for two snails to mate one snail aggressively fights the other looking for attention harming both snails in the process eventually the pursued snail will give in and involuntarily receive a love dart full of sperm 2 x research source you might see a little white dagger like thing sticking out of the snails body do not attempt to remove this as it could harm the snail even more the love dart is the equivalent of having a thumb sized needle in your stomach to prevent mating keep an eye out you might see a snail with its male genitalia out penis this is identifiable by the long white stick like thing close to the shell move the snail to a different terrarium until it has fully retracted this could take a few hours in some cases up to a day look out for eggs if your snails have already laid eggs and you want to dispose of them freeze them for 24 hours then throw them in the trash 3 x research source make sure the condition of your snail s home is in good shape the soil must be at least 2 inches 5 1 cm deep and must be quite moist make sure you purchase soil from your local store just make sure there are no pesticides or fertilizer in the soil as it could harm your snail never use soil from your garden as it could contain pests or parasites that could harm or kill your snail snails need air they re not that different from you and me if you put them in a plastic container make sure you pop some holes in the top keep the temperature moderate and comfortable too take care of their basic needs this doesn t include singing to them because they don t have ears but they do have eyes and a mouth so make sure to provide the right lighting and food necessary for their growth and success check on them regularly 4 x research source snails are omnivores which means they eat vegetation and animals some good sources of food are apples apricot banana black berry grapes kiwi mango melon nectarines orange papaya prickly pear peach pear plum raspberry strawberry tomato lettuce broccoli spinach cabbage cucumber green beans mushrooms peas potato sprouts sweet corn turnip watercress and non seasoned raw meat don t forget the water 5 x research source most snails are nocturnal if you turn on the interrogation lights at night they ll immediately go to hide in their shells if you re looking for a good show they ll be the most entertaining in early evening at night and in the wee hours of the morning sprinkle them with water if you want to excite them a bit 4 x research source make sure they have some foliage to frolic in don t worry they use their feelers to sense obstacles lacking the sight to do so get a couple of leaves and sticks in the cage and make sure you spray it with a water sprayer at least once a day add a layer of sphagnum moss or leaves remember to wet all of it if your snails aren t already in their home place them in now they love damp and dark you may miss the act of their breeding unless you take up nocturnal habits yourself unfortunately there is not much more you can do other than creating a hospitable environment be patient you must now wait until the two snails have mated or impregnated themselves when they have it takes a week or two for them to lay it can take 1 to 4 weeks for the eggs themselves to hatch depending on the species some snails lay them all at once while others spread them around watch the eggs hatch this all depends on the species of your snail and the species you bred it with it could be a very slow or very fast process wait and see the eggs will start to hatch in 1 to 4 weeks onward in some species but it is genes and possibly species dependent with additional factors of how long they have been stored internally and the ambient and soil temperature eggs do not necessarily hatch uniformly and this is more noticeable in species that have a long gestation period perhaps 4 weeks the first usually an uppermost member to hatch can be 10 days or more in front of the main group with some taking noticeably longer 6 x research source make sure to add a fresh food and water source add calcium to help your snails grow strong shells 7 x research source too they love to play pick them up and let them crawl on your hand but be careful you may crack their shell don t pick small ones up because their shell is very weak with the adults do not ever pick them up by their shell,Pets-and-Animals
how to build a squirrel house,many homeowners and garden enthusiasts do not appreciate squirrels one way to protect your garden or your birdhouse is to provide a sanctioned area for squirrels a squirrel house built properly will encourage squirrels to stay in their area and out of yours a squirrel house like a bird house is used to feed and shelter squirrels,gather your tools this is a basic woodwork project and doesn t require anything too elaborate you ll need a saw jig saw if you have one electric screwdriver and screws 3 4 dozen if you don t have an electric screwdriver you could also use a hammer and nails screws hold the squirrel house s design more securely than nails keep the following on hand as well measuring tape pencil and paper first aid kit sandpaper gather wooden boards scrap lumber will work just fine for this project exterior grade plywood could be used but this material is easier for the squirrels to damage two boards should be 12 x 12 or larger to be used as the floor roof and overhang you ll also need two additional 35 x 6 the six is based off the average squirrel size if you notice larger species such as red or grey squirrels use a wider size wood use something between 6 and 10 you don t need to follow these exact dimensions if you acquired enough scrap wood create the front and back panels the key to a good squirrel house is for the roof to overhang slightly to achieve this the front board should be one inch shorter than the back board use your measuring tape to mark 18 on one board and 17 on another board draw legible and straight lines with your pen across the board use your saw and cut along the line in an even fashion take your time sawing a good cut is better than a quick and choppy cut again these are the measurements for this squirrel house you can make your house smaller but don t make it bigger squirrels enjoy compact spaces create your side walls the sides must be the same width as the front and back panels the side panels require a more advanced cut you ll need to measure 18 on one edge and 17 on the other edge 1 x research source each plank s top will be cut into a slanted edge use your measuring tape to mark the right measurements draw a line to connect the 18 marker to the 17 marker use a ruler to create a straight and even line take your time to create a clean cut with your saw you should now be able to see the panels align with the front and back walls create a doorway now you need to create an entrance for the squirrels to use take one of the side panels and measure three inches from the 18 side use the 3 mark to create a hole that is 3 in diameter you re basically removing the pointed edge of a side board it doesn t need to be exactly three inches in diameter but should be close the hole size determines what species can fit into the house 2 x research source people have reported possums n their squirrel house because the opening was too large attach the walls start by positioning all the walls in place using your hands make sure all the front and rear edges align with the proper sides once you re pleased by the outline it s time to attach the walls attach everything in the following order position the front wall 17 with a side wall place the side panel s edge in front of the front panel s edge insert 4 7 evenly spaced nails or screws to attach the two attach the side panel that is attached to the front wall to the back wall 18 again the nail or screws should pass through the side wall before going through the rear wall s edge attach the other side board onto the house for each corner you should use between 4 7 screws or nails if you are using an electric screwdriver take your time it is easy to damage the wood if you try to work too quickly there should be an even slope from 18 back wall to 17 front wall 3 x research source connect the flooring use one of the 12 x 12 boards as flooring for the squirrel house position the frame created in the previous step on top of the 12 x 12 align the 18 wall along the edge of the floor board center the frame and mark where the corners will be on the floor flip the frame to begin attaching the nails and screws attach nails or screw into each corner use between 3 4 screws or nails for each side be careful to only attach the nails or screws along the house s frame fill the house some builders like to insert a wooden divider into the house with a 3 gap to create two stories squirrels like to play in compact spaces make it comfortable for the squirrels by adding pillow fluff or the contents of a stuffed animal another good bedding material is dried moss found in nature or a craft store 4 x research source measure the inner dimensions to create a floor divider for the house cut out a 3 hole as you did with the entrance to the house hold the floor divider and have somebody assist you with attach it with a nail or screw the set of helping hands will attach the screw through the exterior wall into the divider it s okay if there are gaps between the floor divider and the walls this doesn t need to be as tight as the exterior structure attach the roof use the extra 12 x 12 as the roof align the edge of the 12 x 12 to the backside of the roof 18 wall you ll need to hold the wooden board in place as you nail or screw in the roof there should be an overhang on the front of the house 5 x research source scout your yard plan to spend a day watching your yard to witness how active the squirrels are take mental notes of certain trees you see multiple squirrels pass through pick out one of the trees that you think will hold that house to promote squirrel activity choose a location that is 10 to 30 feet off the ground 6 x research source the higher the house is the more likely squirrels will occupy it create a grip you will need two large nails to create a stable grip for the squirrel house use a secure and long ladder to reach the desired spot for the house have a partner around to spot you for safety measures drive the first nail into the tree with a hammer but leave an inch exposed take the second nail and drive that about eight inches parallel to the first nail leave an inch of the second nail exposed the squirrel house should fit in between the two nails wrap the squirrel house you will tighten the squirrel house to the tree by tightening a thick wire around the house and tree make sure you use strong wire that has tightening abilities you could also tie the wire together and tighten with pliers but this may prove dangerous at such a height go to a local hardware store and ask about thick gauged wired that can be tightened easily they will have something that will work mount the squirrel house fit the squirrel house between the two nails previously inserted into the tree the goal is to have the nails fit the house s width in a snug manner then use the wire from the previous step to secure the squirrel house add food squirrels are easy to attract once you ve provided a shelter for them squirrels enjoy the same foods that birds like this is a reason why squirrels invade your bird feeders you could use bird food or any of the following fruit berries sunflower seeds nuts pet food 7 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to trap a coyote,although they are important to the ecosystem coyotes which are wild canines that are found across north america can cause problems when they damage or kill domestic pets like dogs or livestock coyotes sometimes also scavenge through garbage if you are dealing with a nuisance or a destructive coyote there are ways you can trap the coyote to prevent this from happening,use the right trap coyotes are strong animals so you need a trap that is large powerful and fast a no 3 coil spring trap with a jaw spread of about 6 inches 15 cm should do the job a number 1 5 size trap is probably too small to catch a coyote 1 x research source 2 x research source make sure the trap has a center swivel and a reinforced base plate the central swivel will reduce the chances the coyote s foot is harmed by allowing the trapped coyote to pull on a heavy chain that is attached to the bottom of the trap cage traps don t work well with coyotes because they may shy away from them 3 x research source you can find such traps at many manufacturers although sometimes people modify existing traps for example by making a narrow jawed trap wider you can do this by welding a metal strip along the trap s jaw to make its width larger this process is called laminating target the right coyote causing all of the damage there might be many coyotes in the area and you could end up catching family numbers not causing damage so you might need to trap a few coyotes before getting the culprit coyotes that kill livestock are usually male coyotes in the prime of their life between the ages of 3 to 5 years old the dominant male is usually to blame unless it s just small pigs or poultry that are turned up dead there are myths that the most damaging coyotes are old females with pups but this is often not true check the coyote s age and sex when you catch it this will help you determine whether you have caught the male of the likely age to be doing the damage you can best determine a coyote s age by looking at the wear on its teeth look at the wear on the front incisor teeth these teeth are located between the canine teeth if the incisor teeth have rounded lobes the coyote is probably young be very careful though coyotes can be extremely dangerous have a wildlife expert do this coyotes in the prime age to cause damage usually have wear on their incisors and don t have rounded lobes their teeth are flat across the top follow rules and regulations conservation departments of various states will usually have rules and regulations for trapping coyotes make sure you follow them although they can vary by state some examples are regulations that traps must be attended daily must be made of metal with smooth or rubber jaws and must be labeled with the user s name and address generally you will not be able to set traps that are in pathways used by people or domestic animals like dogs and cats some states have notification requirements you need to get permission for example before setting a trap on other people s property find places where the coyote has been before you want to set the trap in a spot where the damage causing coyote is likely to be caught coyotes are known to return to the same areas so look for places where problems have already occurred be on the lookout for coyote tracks old and new and droppings in the ground especially near pastures or pens this is a good place to set a trap for a coyote similarly you could put the trap in the area where a coyote has left an animal carcass coyote droppings are small they are usually a little bigger than a cigar and black when new good places to set coyote traps include farm or livestock trails at field s edge at the intersections of fences where farm trails pass through gates and on open ground don t set coyote traps under trees or against high weeds or brush because coyotes don t like to approach such places choose high ground or ridge tops these are good trap locations because they are areas that coyotes like to frequent and you re less likely to end up with raccoons and other small creatures in your trap locate the trap on the upwind side of the coyote pathway you are targeting this will make it more likely that the coyote will smell your lure or you could set multiple traps to capture all wind directions 4 x research source restrain dogs and cats before setting the trap you don t want to end up with a dog or cat in your trap and they are likely to be drawn to the trap too thus make sure that dogs and cats are not roaming loose before setting the trap use a dirt hole set this is a common trap set used to snare coyotes all you need are a few tools a trowel hammer or hatchet sifter 3 foot square kneeling cloth and a bucket traps come with coil springs or powered cable or non powered cable devices all can work for catching coyotes the dirt hole trap works because coyotes will think it s a hole where another animal buried food the set has bait or lure in the hole to attract the coyote make sure that there is pan tension in the trap about 4 pounds is a good amount of pan tension you could just fill empty plastic bottles with sand to put in the pan to create pan tension dig a hole the hole should be about 4 inches 10 cm in diameter and 8 inches deep at a 45 degree angle it s best to dig under grass so it can serve as backing place the dirt from the hole on the kneeling cloth place the trap 2 to 3 inches 5 1 to 7 6 cm from the hole so you can determine how large to dig the trap s bed dig another hole an inch or so above the ground that is wide enough for the trap and stakes put the trap in the hole level and smooth the trap bed secure the trap with a stake that you drive through the attachment on the swivel use a 5 8 inch 1 6 cm reinforcing rod stake once the stake is in the ground place loose soil from the kneeling cloth to bed the trap twist it into the dirt the trap should be about an inch below the ground install a pan cover to keep dirt away from the trap s springs you want a porous pan cover denim or fiberglass screen could work cut the cover to fit under the jaws and over the pan of the trap pack loose soil around the trap and over the pan cover s ends bed the trap securely by packing soil firmly around it now sift ¼ to ½ inch of dry dirt over the trap bedding a trap means you place the trap solidly in the hole with solid support beneath it so that it doesn t shift if the coyote steps on other parts of the trap instead of the pan you want the finished product to look like an animal dug the hole use a flat set trap instead these traps are also called scent post sets and they are used to trap coyotes along trails or paths find a clump of grass in an area where the coyote has used droppings you will want a large lure object so it attracts the attention of a passing coyote you want to place the lure object perpendicular to the coyote s path bed and cover the flat set as you would the dirt hole set cover over the tarp with dried grass leaves or dried cow or sheep manure that was grated through a sifter use a blind set blind sets are sometimes used as a last resort place the set in an area where there are coyote tracks as if the coyote has jumped over something such as a fence conceal and cover the blind spot as you would a flat set place the trap where the coyote hits the ground when it jumps over a fence carefully hide the trap placing small sticks on either side of it to direct the coyote onto it you generally don t use bait or lure in a blind set because the goal is that the coyote will jump over the fence into the trap add bait lure or scent it works better to put two or more lures in the hole instead of just one you need something though that will draw the coyote to the trap tainted meat bait is a popular choice beaver bobcat cattle or skunk but these choices might not work well in hot weather commercial lures may be less messy than meat bait commercial lures contain odors that coyotes like such as beaver castor or tonquin musk some also contain skunk essence because this is known to attract coyotes coyote trappers often have their own recipes one homemade lure uses rotten eggs by breaking four dozen eggs into a gallon jar stir them and let it set for a couple of months you could also put a ball of sheep wool in the hole and pour lures on it coyote gland lure red fox urine or coyote urine in addition to coyote droppings can also be used remove the coyote from the trap some traps are lethal traps they work by putting a rope around the animal s head but in other cases the coyote may be trapped live seek a professional s help in removing the coyote from the trap trapped coyotes are very dangerous many jurisdictions will require that the coyote be euthanized after trapping others may offer places it can be taken to contact your local governmental wildlife or conservation department wear thick clothing and protective gloves when dealing with a coyote be aware that coyotes can carry rabies and other diseases 5 x research source clean the trap you can clean a coyote trap with a high pressure hose at a car wash you will want to clean the trap before using it again after you catch a coyote or any other animal another possibility is to use hot soapy water soak the trap in it then scrub the trap with a stiff brush rinse the trap in clean water hang it outside to let it dry you don t need to dye or wax the trap unless it s used in the winter and gets salt on it log wood crystals are commercial dyes used on traps to help prevent rusting put the dye in a large water container heat it until it boils add the traps to the boiling water until they turn brown or black resolve coyote conflicts without trapping some animal rights groups consider trapping coyotes to be inhumane they have educational programs about how to resolve coyote conflicts 6 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source keep food and water away from the coyote coyotes are often lured to a neighborhood because they are hungry or thirsty food can attract a coyote to your neighborhood things like unsecured garbage compost piles and pet food may draw a coyote over get rid of such things and the coyote might go elsewhere water draws coyotes as much as food does so artificial lakes irrigation and pet water dishes are all things that could draw the coyote to your neighborhood 7 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source haze the coyote to instill fear of humans in the coyote coyotes have become fairly accustomed to human beings the goal is to make them afraid of coming around people again when you see a coyote be very loud for example you could yell or use homemade noisemakers make yourself appear as large as possible stand tall and wave your arms around set up fencing if you want to keep a coyote away from livestock you could use fencing that will deter the coyote for example net fences in good repair will stop a lot of coyotes if the mesh spacing is less than 6 inches 15 2 cm and the vertical spacing is less than 4 inches electric fencing also can work but it can require more labor to keep it maintained use a guarding animal sometimes people who are trying to protect livestock will employ a livestock guarding dog this is a dog that is reared to repel predators the most common livestock guarding dogs are great pyrenees komondor anatolian shepherd and the akbash dog the dogs need to be trained it would be very dangerous to the dog to use an untrained dog as a guarding animal,Pets-and-Animals

how to identify termite larvae,termites can pose a serious risk to the structure and foundation of your home the presence of termite larvae in particular may indicate if the building is infested or not termite larvae can be identified by their shape color and size they are often found with worker termites deep within termite colonies that said they can mistaken for other insects so it is important to understand the features and qualities of this particular pest,inspect their shape larvae have soft bodies instead of a hard outer shell they have a distinct head from the rest of their body as well as six legs their antennae are straight 1 x research source termite larvae tend to look extremely similar to worker and nymph termites except for their size larvae are much smaller than workers and nymphs termites may resemble ants but where ants bodies have a narrow waist termites bodies are smooth and straight termites also have straight antennae where ants have bent antennae 2 x research source examine their color termite larvae tend to be white and almost translucent in their color keep in mind that older worker and nymph termites also have similar pale coloring so color alone cannot determine if it is a larva or not if they have pale white bodies but darker heads they may be soldier termites these are adult termites if they have a darker color such as brown or black they may be booklice or ants instead if they have wings they may be reproductive termites measure them most termite larvae are less than 1 10 of an inch 2 5 mm long in comparison an adult worker termite is usually around ¼ inch 6 4 mm long some reproductive termites known as alates can grow to be half an inch 13 mm large but if the insect is larger than this they may not be a termite at all termite larvae are about the same size as the eggs they emerge from these eggs are very small and white they may be difficult to find as they are kept deep within the colony that said if you find some termites near a pile of eggs you can compare the size if they re roughly the same size you ve found larvae 3 x research source identify adult termites if you find mature termites there are probably larvae somewhere in the colony while there are a few different types of adult termite you can typically identify them by their pale soft bodies worker and nymph termites look like larger versions of the larvae while soldiers have a dark hardened head only the reproductive termites that lay eggs have wings inspect areas where termites live while you may need a professional exterminator to find most termites you can do a basic check inspection to see if you can notice any signs of infestation start by inspecting window sills window and door frames support beams and places where concrete structures join wooden ones 4 x research source joshua bloom pest control specialist personal interview 8 may 2020 use a flashlight to peer into cracks and dark spaces you should also check in the basement in crawl spaces under the porch and anywhere that moisture is present 5 x research source joshua bloom pest control specialist personal interview 8 may 2020 note that termites often live deep within the walls and they can infest a home for years without being noticed just because there are no external signs of termites does not mean that you do not have them listen to the walls using a screwdriver gently tap the wood or surface of a wall listen for any hollow or rustling noises coming from inside the wood this may indicate that there is something living inside the wood 6 x research source break open mud tubes termites may build mud tubes to travel between areas of their colony these may look like branches or lines of mud crawling up the wall or foundation you can break a tube open to see if there are any termites inside note that if a tube is empty it may still mean that there are termites elsewhere in the building 7 x research source hire an exterminator termites can live deep within a structure and they often keep their larvae within the most protected parts of their nest to measure the extent of the problem you should consult with a professional pest control company

can find them termite larvae look like a smaller version of the adult worker and nymph termites they have a separate segmented head legs and antennae ant larvae look like grubs they have no legs or eyes nor do they appear to have a separate segmented head they are also covered in tiny hairs 9 x research source learn to identify psocids or booklice like termite larvae psocids also known as booklice are small and white that said booklice only grow between 1 16 and 1 8 of an inch long between 1 6 and 3 2 mm they do not feed on wood rather they eat the fungus that grows on wood books and other starchy objects in moist environments 10 x research source if you do not have any damage to the wood or other signs of termites you may have found psocids instead of termite larvae to be sure take a few insects in to your local pest control places where psocids are found include books newspapers moldy foods and grains old wallpaper cardboard boxes and other paper products in comparison termites are often found in walls wood piles stumps crawl spaces and other wooden areas determine if wood damage was caused by beetles instead termites are not the only insect to feed on wood powderpost beetles look distinctively different than termites they have darker harder bodies and some may be covered with fine hairs powderpost larvae are white and c shaped they have tiny spines along their back 11 x research source the best way to know if you have powderpost beetles or termites is to hire an exterminator they may be able to identify the pest based on the pattern of damage

animals of any species and rodents of all ages have a need to chew and will test their teeth on anything they can find always assume the worst will happen and tidy away those cables,block access to cords with furniture 2 x research source take advantage of any sturdy object in your home that can act as a barrier between your pet and electrical cords tuck as many cords as you can under or behind bookcases tv stands cabinets and dressers if you have large pets you can simply tuck many power cables under or behind furniture however smaller pets such as cats or ferrets can squeeze into extremely small spaces which may make it harder to apply this method attach the cords to table or desk legs using wire ties pets are more likely to chew loose wires you can also run electrical cords under rugs or other floor mats lift cords out of your pet s reach getting them off the floor and affixing them to walls and furniture surfaces with adhesive backed cord clips covers all the bases because pets can t hurt themselves with something they don t even have access to use your cords to create wall art use u shaped cable brackets to mount cords to the wall in loops or other fun patterns 3 x research source run cables through the walls if you have drywall it can be relatively easy to drill two small holes through which you can thread your cords use a tool such as fish tape or a cable puller to feed the cord through the wall cords can also be threaded through the attic or basement put detachable cords away the power supply for a laptop or other portable device can be particularly easy to damage and expensive to replace so put these cables away instead of leaving them out to be chewed wind up excess cord lengths excess cord and cable lengths can be strangulation hazards to cats and

how to trap a backyard bird,trapping birds is illegal in many states and countries however there are exceptions for certain birds and trapping birds for survival is a viable source of essential calories in the wilderness if you re in the wild trap away otherwise be sure to research local codes and ordinances to see if you need a permit 1 x research source,use two sticks a cord a rock and your pocketknife to build to an ojibwa bird pole this trap has been used in canada since prehistoric times it looks a bit like an upside down l birds will perch on the smaller stick which is rigged to a simple noose that tightens when a bird lands on the perch while it requires some knowledge of knots the ojibwa bird pole is the simplest easiest trap you can make in the wilderness you ll need a large branch roughly the width of a few fingers and 5 6 feet long a pencil thin stick roughly six inches long a rock roughly the size of your fist a 3 4 foot cord or rope this can be a shoestring a sleeping bag cord a sturdy vine or twine a sharp pocket knife sharpen both ends of the longer pole the bottom end will be driven into the ground and the top needs to be sharp so that birds perch on your trap not the pole drill a hole through the pole near one of the ends it doesn t need to be wide just wide enough to push your thin stick through tie one end of the rope firmly around your rock the rock acts as your counter weight holding the trap in place until a bird springs it any knot will do wedge the thin stick into the hole you drilled it should be right next to the string but the string should still move freely you don t want to put the stick all the way in just enough to keep it in place this perch needs to fall under the weight of the bird in order to snare it thread the string through the hole and tie a small knot in it the weight of the rock will try and pull the string back through your hole you want to make it so that combined the knot and the stick hold the rope in place with the rock hanging freely about halfway up the pole this may take some trial and error since your hole and stick size will be different depending on your materials the knot should be able to move freely through the hole in the pole when the stick isn t jammed in some trappers tie the small knot first then put the stick in experiment with what works for you you should have two feet of string or more on the other side of your knot tie a slip noose knot in the end of the string take the end of the string and make a noose big enough to fit your fist through to make a slip noose double the string back on itself to make a u shaped loop run the end of the string back towards the top of the loop it will look a bit like a flattened s wrap the end of the rope around the doubled line 2 3 times pull the rope tight cinching the wrap around the doubled string 2 x research source run the end of the rope through the noose knot back towards the pole you ll be left with a circle of rope draped over your perch the end of the noose will be at the end of the perch and the noose knot itself will be close to the pole you should have two semi circles of rope draped off of the stick tie a simple overhand knot right where the two sticks meet an overhand knot is simply when you create a loop and pull the string through all you have to do is wrap the end around the rope near your hole creating a circle then run the end through that circle this should be right at the point where your two sticks meet 3 x research source test the trap by gently pushing the perch down as you do the weight of the rock should pull the rope through the hole which will quickly tighten the noose and grab your finger note however that these traps are very variable play with the size of the noose and the perch the closer they are to the same size the more effective your trap will be also try and tie the smallest knot possible in the beginning so that the rope can move freely through the hole you want it to snap shut quickly once the stick is removed place your trap in an open area where it is the best option for a bird to sit if you place this trap in the woods you significantly decrease the chances a bird will land there there are plenty of good trees around place it in an open area where it is the only place for them to land for the best results note that this trap is a supplement for a survival diet not a main source of food small birds in general only provide about 100 calories apiece unless you have 4 5 successful traps there are much better returns on your investment when looking for food including insects and game traps for rabbits and squirrels still especially in the winter these traps can be a viable source of nutrition when paired with other methods 4 x research source build a backyard trap using a mousetrap a cardboard box and some string this simple trap will drop a box on the bird containing it until you get to it later it can also be used to catch small game like rabbits and squirrels purchase a live rat or mouse trap you want the classic kind a simple wooden board with a spring loaded trap wire you can find these traps at almost any hardware store 5 x research source cut a small hole in the middle of a cardboard box the box should be about twice as big as the bird you want to catch 6 x trustworthy source the cornell lab of ornithology research lab of cornell university dedicated to interpreting and conserving the earth s biological diversity through research and education about birds go to source nail the mouse trap into the ground place a nail in the center of the trap and hammer it into the ground you should use a fairly long nail it will secure the trap into the dirt so that it doesn t move when the bird lands 7 x research source balance the box on one edge by slipping it slightly under the mouse trap 8 x research source tie a loop in one end of the thread temporarily loop it around part of the mouse trap thread the other end through the hole in the top of the box later on you ll attach this loop to the spring but for now you just need it looped somewhere on the trap to create tension in the line tie a loop in the end of the thread opposite the mousetrap nail that end into the ground pulling the nail out enough to tighten the line so that the box balances on one edge the inside of the box should be facing the ground with one side raised to allow birds to enter adjust the thread so that the highest edge of the box is only a foot or so in the air 9 x research source the box needs to be high enough the a bird flies into it but low enough that it can shut quickly tie the mouse trap end of the string around the spring load the spring but not the arm you want the string to be on the mechanism that spring when a mouse or in this case bird steps on it when the bird releases the spring the box will fall around the bird trapping it 10 x research source the tension of the string is holding the box in place make sure you tie the string so that it sits correctly place some bread or birdseed on the mousetrap as bait remember you want the bird to land on the trap springing it and releasing the string it will cause the box to fall and allow you to trap the bird 11 x research source leave the trap alone for 6 12 hours constant human activity near the trap will scare birds away if you see that the box has fallen go check it to see if you caught anything always wear long sleeves and gloves when grabbing a live bird to get the bird out of your trap lift the box slightly reach in and grab the bird firmly around the body wear gloves and long sleeves to prevent any pecking or scratching wounds there is always the chance that you ll catch a rabbit or squirrel as well with your trap since it is on the ground be ready for anything make sure the bird needs help sometimes adult birds simply need a moment to recover after running into something let the bird try to recover before you attempt to catch it you may only injure it further as it tries to get away 12 x research source similarly baby birds that have their feathers are often learning to fly which is why they are out of the nest their parents are likely nearby keeping an eye out and they should be left alone unless they are injured 13 x research source if you think a baby bird has been abandoned call a wildlife rehabilitator you can find one through your local veterinarian or wildlife agency humane societies can also help you find one once you call the rehabilitator should be able to tell you what to do with the bird such as leave it

bet to help protect your hands 15 x research source if you are helping a bird of prey upgrade to sturdy leather gloves come up behind the bird if possible come up out of sight of the bird birds can fly away even with injuries so you can startle it into flight by coming from the front 16 x research source another method is to use a piece of cloth such as a pillowcase come up behind the bird and drape the cloth over it 17 x research source when you do pick up the bird pick it up with the cloth around it 18 x research source have a box ready to safely store the bird use a small cardboard box a shoebox works fine for this purpose poke holes in the top and place something soft inside such as a washcloth 19 x research source know how to hold the bird hold small birds in one hand and big birds in two with one hand the bird s head should come between the first and middle finger wrap the rest of your hand around the bird s body rest one hand on either side of the body hold the bird firmly but don t squeeze too tightly 20 x research source transfer the bird to the box set the bird gently in the box and quickly put the lid in put the box in a quiet dark area until you can call a wildlife rehabilitator 21 x research source call your vet or your local wildlife authorities they will have information about finding a local rehabilitator rehabilitators are trained to care for injured birds

how to train your fish to do tricks,having a pet fish may not seem as fun or exciting as having a pet dog or cat however with the proper training your fish can be taught to interact with you and do tricks just like any other pet the easiest fish breeds to train include oscars goldfish and bettas male betta fish are usually kept alone in a bowl making them the most focused and easiest to train 1 x research source,put your finger on the outside of your aquarium tank near your fish your goal is to get your fish s attention and once you get its attention reward it with food if your fish responds to your finger right away award it with food if your fish does not respond right away shake your finger until it does notice 2 x research source you can consider placing your finger in the fish tank for your fish to follow as well some types of fish tend to bite including bettas so do some research on your breed fish before putting your finger in their tank get your fish to follow your finger move your finger back and forth across the tank and reward your fish every time time it follows your finger getting your fish to come to your finger is the first step but getting your fish to follow your finger as it moves may be a bit more difficult move your finger up and down from side to side etc do not reward your fish until it follows your finger use repetition and rewards to train your fish quickly the fastest and most effective way to train your fish is by using food to reward its behavior with repetition your fish will learn to associate following your finger with being fed once your fish understands that they will be fed for doing what you instruct them to do you ll be able to teach them a variety of other tricks 3 x research source if you have pellets use them for your training instead of regular fish food if you use pellets for training rather than normal feeding your fish will view them as a special treat obtain a hoop for your fish to swim through you ll need a hoop that is big enough for your fish to easily swim through for smaller fish using a larger hoop earring or bracelet could work as a hoop if you want a larger hoop you can typically make one out of pipe cleaner make sure to wash the hoop so that it doesn t bring any harmful bacteria or substances into your fish tank attach your hoop to a strong or pole if you re uncomfortable putting your hand in your fish tank start with a larger hoop to make it easier for your fish to swim through stick the ring in the water your hoop should be perpendicular to the side of the aquarium and near the glass as this will make it easier for you to direct your fish to swim through it your fish may be interested in the hoop right away or it will simply ignore the hoop make your fish follow your finger through the hoop teaching your fish to follow your finger will come in handy for this trick simply move your finger across the glass of the fish tank so that your fish follows it run your finger along the glass where the hoop is and your fish should swim right through it this may take a couple tries but your fish should start to catch on reward your fish with a treat every time it swims through the hoop this will help teach your fish that swimming through hoops will result in being fed practice this trick with your fish daily so that it becomes a regular trick once your fish has mastered swimming through large hoops decrease the size of the hoop to make the trick more challenging begin adding additional hoops for your fish to swim through for a more impressive trick for more detailed instructions and tips on how how to teach your fish to swim through hoops check out teach your betta fish to swim through a hoop decorate your fish tank like an obstacle course use hoops arches plants etc to make your fish tank into an obstacle course once you ve taught your fish how to swim through hoops they should be able to swim through and around anything with some guidance be patient when teaching your fish how to swim through an obstacle course as it may take some time lead your fish around the course with your finger or a treat your fish will most likely follow your finger around once it has mastered that trick so lead your fish through its obstacle course start with simple obstacle courses and make them harder once your fish starts to master the obstacles use a treat on a string or a hood to lead your fish around instead of your finger if you want your fish to follow you all around the tank it may be hard for you to use your finger stick a treat on a hook stick or string and move it around the course so that the fish follows it make sure the fish doesn t get the treat until it s finished the course reward your fish with a treat after it completes the obstacle course just like all the other tricks positive reinforcement will help train your fish quickly give them a treat every time they complete the obstacle course if you ve had the treat on a hook make sure to remove it from the hook before feeding it to the fish feed your fish by hand every day this will teach your fish that seeing your hand means that they will be getting fed make this a normal routine so that your fish becomes familiar with your hand and knows what to expect when it comes time for feeding this will also help your fish begin to develop trust with you train your fish to swim to the surface for feeding start by getting your fish s attention by placing your fingertips in the water this should get them to swim to the surface if this does not get their attention hold some food in your fingertips as you place them in the water do not release the food into the water as you should not feed them until they have performed the trick hold your fish s food just above the water after you ve gotten their attention dangle some of their food just above the water if your fish does not jump for the food right away you ll need to encourage them place your fingertips full of food on the surface of the water and pull them from the water as your fish approaches this should encourage your fish to jump from the water to eat their food 4 x research source reward your fish with some treats once they jump out of the water this positive reinforcement will show them that jumping from the water will get them an extra treat as opposed to just their regular food,Pets-and-Animals
how to keep birds out of trees,while birds may look pretty and sound nice in your yard you may want to prevent them from taking up permanent residency in your trees birds will often eat fruit like apples or oranges on trees certain birds like magpies and sparrows will also scare away smaller birds and build nests on branches to keep birds out of your trees you can use deterrents like shiny ribbons and moving devices you can also put up barriers and prune the trees to deter birds from perching on them,hang cd roms from string in the trees birds do not like reflective surfaces and will be scared away by the cd roms especially when they reflect bright sunlight tie string around the cd roms and attach one per tree branch hang them 2 to 4 inches 5 1 to 10 2 cm down from the branches 1 x research source if you are trying to deter birds from fruit bearing trees harvest the fruit and then remove the cd roms you can put them back up next year as the trees start to bear fruit to keep birds away you can also use pie plates instead of cd roms as they are also reflective poke holes through the pie plates and tie string to them then attach one pie plate per branch tie shiny ribbons to the branches shiny ribbons will also deter birds from hanging out in your trees get ribbons made of shiny material in bright colors like red yellow or orange 2 x research source make sure you replace the shiny ribbons after a storm or bad weather so they are effective use shiny scary looking balloons in the trees get balloons with scary faces that are made of shiny material balloons with menacing bird faces are ideal as they will fool the birds into thinking there are predators in the trees tie them onto the tree branches with string 3 x research source you will need to move the balloons around the trees once a week so the birds think they are alive place a scarecrow at the base of the trees make a scarecrow out of straw and wood that is half the size of the trees dress the scarecrow in a hat or a shirt the birds will think it is human and stay away 4 x research source you will need to change the position of the scarecrow once a week so the birds think it is a real person you should also change the scarecrow s appearance by putting a hat on it or an item of clothing try a decoy hawk or owl you can buy decoy hawks made out of plastic at your local hardware store or online birds are scared of hawks and owls and will assume the decoy is real 5 x research source you will need to move the hawk or owl around to a different spot in the trees every few days so the birds think it is alive use a moving device a moving device like a spider that wiggles or a hawk that makes screeching noises can scare the birds away look for moving devices at your local hardware store or online hang them from the trees so they can deter the birds 6 x research source most moving devices run on batteries you will need to swap out the batteries regularly so the devices keep working sometimes moving devices can be annoying to people because they will release high pitched sounds regularly get a bird sound deterrent for the trees look for a bird sound deterrent at your local hardware store or online these devices send out bird distress calls to keep birds away hang them in your trees 7 x research source these deterrents use batteries so you will need to replace them regularly most sound deterrents use sound waves that cannot be detected by humans only by birds you should not be bothered by these devices drape the trees with plastic netting netting is a great way to deter birds and protect fruit bearing trees use bamboo poles fence posts or tall stakes to create a frame around the tree then drape the netting over the frame so it reaches the ground use wire to anchor the netting to the ground so it does not move 8 x research source netting that has been well anchored will usually stay in place despite wind or rough weather keep in mind that barriers like plastic netting may not look the most attractive on your trees but they will help keep birds away put chicken wire over the trees make a net out of chicken wire and drape it over the trees use bricks or wood to secure the bottom of the chicken wire so it does not blow away or move 9 x research source use reflective tape you can also put a layer of reflective tape over the tree branches to keep birds out use flash tape that makes a crinkling sound as the sound will also deter the birds 10 x research source make sure you secure the tape by tying it to a piece of wire in the ground cut off overgrown branches use a clean pair of garden shears to prune branches that are overgrown or damaged remove branches that cross each other or that are growing inward towards the tree trunk cut the branches at a 45 degree angle pruning them just above the tree trunk 11 x research source removing branches on the tree will give the birds less of a surface area for perching this can deter them from spending too much time in the trees it will also encourage the tree to grow well trim the trees regularly prune the trees in late fall or winter so it has time to recover and grow in trim the trees so they maintain their shape and do not become overgrown only trim 25 percent or less of the tree at one time over trimming the tree can actually cause it to become more overgrown and out of control 12 x research source if you have fruit bearing trees make sure you harvest the fruit once it is ready to be picked so birds stay away hire an arborist to cut the trees for you if you are unsure how to prune your trees properly look for a local arborist who can do this for you search online for a reputable arborist who has experience cutting your tree type once they inspect your trees you can then ask them how to maintain the trees so birds stay away,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for slugs,if you are looking for an unusual pet a slug is a great choice slugs are easy to care for and they are good for both older and younger kids this helps your kids gain responsibility you can keep a slug in an aquarium slugs feed off of plants such as fruits and vegetables keep in mind slugs are very sensitive to chemicals so keep them away from things like hairsprays and tap water slugs generally live between one and five years,find the right container slugs generally do well in aquariums an aquarium should be at least 20 centimeters by 20 centimeters 8 by 8 inches you can buy an aquarium online or at a pet store 1 x research source make sure to provide proper ventilation the lid should have holes for ventilation something like a mesh lid for example would work well slugs are very small especially in comparison to reptiles that are usually kept in aquariums examine ventilation holes carefully and make sure a slug cannot creep out of these holes provide substrate it s best to use soil grass and leaves from outdoors for the substrate if you took the slug from outdoors use soil leaves and grass from the area where you found it make sure to sift through soil before adding it to your aquarium to remove any bugs 2 x research source once a week remove your slug and put it in a safe container with air holes remove the substrate and then replace it invest in aquarium supplies slugs may benefit from certain aquarium supplies such as fake plants and leaves you can also bring in real material from outside such as twigs for slugs to climb on 3 x research source if you bring anything in from outside make sure to inspect it carefully before putting it in your slug s tank clean the aquarium regularly once every three months clean the slug s enclosure when you remove and replace the substrate you can rinse things like twigs and aquarium supplies in distilled water and then let them air dry outside if twigs get soggy or soft in response to water replace them with new twigs 4 x research source slugs are very sensitive to chemicals only use distilled water when washing the slug s aquarium you should refrain from washing anything with soap slugs are sensitive to tap water so opt for distilled water keep the room cool and humid slugs prefer temperatures between 60 70 f 16 21 c put a humidifier next to their aquarium to keep them hydrated if the aquarium is too hot or cold the slug will bury itself and produce more mucous if it is not humid enough the slug will dry out 5 x research source provide rinsed fruits and vegetables slugs feed off of plants you can give them leftover fruits and vegetables from your kitchen you can also give them fresh fruits and vegetables as long as you rinse them in distilled water first it s important to remove pesticides before feeding plants to your slugs 6 x research source if possible opt for organic fruits that do not make use of pesticides in general feed your slugs more vegetables than fruits slugs can die from consuming too much sugar even natural sugar from fruits add plants and leaves for food slugs also feed off of plants they find outside add things like old leaves grass and other plants you find outside slugs feed on decaying plant matter so if you have a plant that s dying you can feed it to your slug 7 x research source remove uneaten food every day slugs may not eat everything you leave for them uneaten food especially fruit can attract fruit flies fruit flies can threaten a slug s health so remove uneaten food at the end of each day this will minimize exposure to bugs and keep your slugs safe 8 x research source use a spray bottle not a water dish slugs do not need a separate water dish just a moist environment you should therefore spray the enclosure with a water bottle each day you should use distilled water as tap water can be harmful to slugs it s important to keep a slug s environment moist so they can absorb the water they need 9 x research source do not use certain sprays around your slug slugs are very sensitive to chemicals and absorb sprays through their skin do not use hairspray or aerosol sprays in the same room where you keep your slugs this can cause them to die 10 x research source avoid handling your slug slugs should not be handled too often only handle them when you need to remove them from the tank for cleaning if you must handle them pick them up with wet hands slugs dislike being handled and chemicals on your hands from things like lotions and soaps can be harmful to slugs 11 x research source spritz the aquarium with distilled water regularly slugs need a moist environment to thrive each day spritz the inside of your slug s cage with a water bottle filled with distilled after slugs may die if an environment is not adequately moist 12 x research source it s very important to use distilled water the chemicals found in tap water can kill slugs,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for triops,triops have been around for almost 300 million years making them the oldest animals on the planet 1 x research source to care for the aquatic creatures create an ideal habitat by filling a tank with filtered water and if you plan on hatching your triops from eggs adding substrate once the triops have hatched feed them every 3 days and clean their water at least once a week if you care for them properly you can enjoy your new pets for up to 3 months,fill a tank with 5 to 1 gallon 1 9 to 3 8 l of natural spring water per triops pour the water into an empty clean aquarium or fish tank measure out the right amount based on the number of triops you currently have or expect to have after hatching use natural spring water which has calcium to help the animals grow 2 x research source you can also use tap water as long as it s been treated to remove all chlorine which is toxic to triops do not use mineral or distilled water the mineral level in mineral water is too high whereas distilled water doesn t have enough calcium for the triops place a heat lamp above the tank to keep the water between 72 and 84 f 22 and 29 c because triops need warm water to hatch and thrive set a lamp over the top of the tank to maintain a mild water temperature position either a fluorescent or incandescent light about 12 inches 30 cm above the water put an aquarium thermometer in the tank to monitor the water temperature if the tank is sitting somewhere in the sun or in a warm room you may not need the light to heat the water add substrate to the tank if you d like to recreate their natural habitat line the tank with soil gravel or sand so the triops can dig around fill the bottom with about 1 to 2 inches 2 5 to 5 1 cm of your chosen substrate to protect any larvae and prevent the triops from mistaking the eggs for a snack 3 x research source you can buy the substrate at a pet store or from an online retailer wash the substrate with plain tap water before putting it in the tank to remove any potential chemicals or dirt choose plants carefully if you want to add decoration while triops don t require any plants or extra items like large stones or fake castles in their tank you can put some in if you d like it to look more appealing only use plants or decorations that are safe for aquarium use however so you don t accidentally poison the triops 4 x research source never put things you find in nature like a rock or a log in the tank as they can contain harmful bacteria change out about 25 of the water in the tank once a week to keep the water fresh replace about 1 4 of it on a weekly basis scoop it out with a cup or bucket then pour clean natural spring water in be careful not to scoop up the triops with it 5 x research source do not use soap when cleaning your tank it s poisonous to triops if you notice any algae growing which will look like green fuzz on the inside of tank transfer the triops to another container and wipe down the tank then fill it with fresh water and put the triops back buy a triops kit from a pet store or online retailer select a kit that contains at least the triops eggs food and care instructions you can also find kits that come with a tank thermometer or dish for hatching the eggs most kits cost between 10 and 20 sprinkle about 20 eggs into the tank out of these 20 eggs you ll likely only get 1 to 3 triops make sure that the eggs which are as small as a grain of sand go into the water and don t accidentally blow away or get stuck on the edge of the aquarium most kits come with around 40 to 60 eggs so you can have 2 to 3 hatching cycles you can also hatch your triops in the small dish provided with the kit to do this simply place the eggs in the dish then transfer the triops to the larger tank after they hatch wait 1 to 4 days for the eggs to hatch after you sprinkle the eggs into the water expect them to hatch between 24 and 96 hours later look closely as newborn triops are so small they re almost invisible to the human eye for the first few days if you re hatching the eggs in the fall or winter when it s colder it can take an additional 3 to 5 days for the triops to hatch feed the triops once a day starting on the 2nd day after they hatch wait 2 days after the triops hatch to start feeding them crush 3 5 pieces of triops food using a spoon and sprinkle it into the tank if your kit didn t come with triops food you can use green algae powder instead always crush the food for the first 7 days which is how long it takes the triops to become full adults until they re adults they can t eat regular sized food increase the amount of food to 8 to 10 pieces on the 3rd day for the 2nd feeding crush 8 to 10 pellets and sprinkle them into the tank do this only once throughout the day be careful not to overfeed the triops wait until all of the food from the 1st feeding is gone before you add more continue gradually increasing the amount of crushed food measure the amount of food using the spoon provided in the kit or with a teaspoon on day 4 for example crush enough food to fill 1 spoon if you have 5 or less triops or 2 spoons if you have more than 5 triops for days 5 and 6 feed 1 spoonful twice a day for 5 triops or less and 2 spoonfuls once a day for more than 5 on day 7 feed 2 spoonfuls twice a day for 5 or less and 4 spoonfuls once a day for more than 5 feed each triops about 1 pellet twice a day starting on the 8th day once the triops are fully grown after day 7 give them uncrushed food 2 times a day space out the feedings so that all of the food from the 1st feeding is consumed before you give them more 6 x research source if your triops only eats 1 pellet a day instead of 2 that s okay just avoid giving them more than they can eat or the uneaten food will mold in the tank if you run out of triops food for your adult pets use high quality pellet fish food supplement your triops diet with protein if you want them to get bigger to grow larger triops give them 1 teaspoon 6 g of protein in the form of insect larvae brine shrimp or fish feed this to the triops no more than 2 times a week 7 x research source make sure you cut up the food into the smallest pieces possible so it s easy for the triops to digest them,Pets-and-Animals
how to keep a stray cat away from your cat,a stray cat can be problematic especially when he comes into your yard you can have even bigger problems if the stray provokes or gets into a tussle with your cat to protect your cat your yard and maybe even your sanity it will be good for you to learn about how to keep a stray cat away from your property,locate any bird feeders in your yard bird feeders can be as popular for stray cats as they are for birds 1 x research source a stray cat may see those bird feeders as a way to attack readily available prey if you have multiple bird feeders you may be attracting more than one stray cat to your yard which could be very distressing to your cat identify potential food sources if your cat is exclusively outdoors and you feed him outside you could be attracting stray cats to your yard not only would the stray cat want to keep coming back for the food he would likely fight your cat for access to the food which could place your cat at risk of serious injury and illness additionally if you grow catnip in your yard you could be making your yard very attractive to a stray cat 2 x research source verify the reproductive status of your cat if you have a female cat that has not been spayed she could be attracting intact male cats to your yard 3 x research source your female cat would be giving off pheromones that an intact male cat would be able to smell if you know that your female cat is not spayed and you notice that male stray cats are on the prowl in your yard schedule an appointment to have your cat spayed as soon as possible if your intact female cat comes into contact with an intact male stray cat your cat could become pregnant observe the stray cat the stray cat may frequent a particular area of your yard such as a garden or sandbox he may also like to go to an area under your house that is warm and safe if you can identify where the stray cat likes to go then you can start coming up with ways to keep him out of those particular areas if keeping an eye out on the stray cat is not practical for your schedule you could also observe how your cat is acting if your cat starts to spray inside your house either at the window or on the wall near the opposite window it is likely that a stray cat is visiting your yard 4 x research source take notice if your cat becomes increasingly aggressive at you or other pets in your home called redirected aggression if he cannot actually get to the stray cat outside 5 x research source your cat may also become fearful inside your home if a stray cat is outside even though you know that the stray cat has no chance of entering your home your cat does not know that and may resort to hiding inside the house 6 x research source keep your cat indoors if the stray cat comes to your yard because he knows that your cat is in the yard as well you should keep your cat indoors stray cats tend not to be fully vaccinated and can carry a variety of diseases e g feline immunodeficiency virus feline leukemia virus that could make your cat very sick so it is primarily for safety and health reasons that you should keep your cat inside 7 x research source 8 x research source keep in mind that the stray may continue to come to your yard since he knows your cat is somewhere in the vicinity if your cat is used to being outdoors provide him with plenty of toys inside your home that will keep him busy and mentally stimulated 9 x research source if your cat is outdoors the techniques needed to keep a stray cat away from your cat may startle and disturb your cat this is another reason why you should keep your cat indoors at least until you are confident that the stray cat will not come back place a motion activated sprinkler in your yard one of the best ways to keep a stray cat away from your cat is to make your yard as undesirable as possible to him a motion activated sprinklers are available that are specifically designed to deter animals the sprinkler will spray water on the stray cat when he walks near it you could place the sprinkler where you usually see the stray enter your yard after a few of days of getting splashed on unexpectedly the stray cat will probably stay away from your property you can remove the sprinkler or spray after you notice that the stray cat is no longer coming to your yard you should put the motion activated devices back in your yard if he returns or if you see a different stray cat in your yard use an ultrasonic device to keep the stray cat away outdoor ultrasonic devices work in a similar way to a motion activated sprinkler or spray when the stray cat steps near it the device will emit a high frequency sound that will you will not be able to hear but will be very irritating to him he may be more annoyed than startled at the sound but the sound may be irritating enough to keep him out of your yard if you notice that the ultrasound device is bothersome to your own cat consider using another type of deterrent device or another method to keep the stray cat away use natural deterrents to make your garden undesirable a stray cat may treat your garden like a litter box if you do not want to spend money on deterrent devices to keep him out of your garden you can use what you already have at home to keep him out to make your garden undesirable you can put chicken wire or prickly pinecones in it to make it more difficult for the stray cat to walk through or dig in the chicken wire can be placed either on top of the soil or just below the surface if you use chicken wire make sure to cut holes in the wire that are large enough for your plants to continue growing 10 x research source cats do not like the smell of citrus so you could also place lemon or orange peels in your garden however the peels could attract other wild animals to your garden so you might end up replacing one animal problem by another 11 x research source you can also sprinkle ground pepper black pepper plus chili pepper or coffee grounds on your annuals or perennials to keep a stray cat out of your garden 12 x research source try planting cat repellent plants such as coleus canina in your garden these plants produce a foul odor that will keep the stray cat out of your garden inquire about these types of plants at your local gardening store to find out if the smell is also bothersome to people you could also make your own cat repellent cover up the sandbox if you have a sandbox in your yard you should cover it securely to keep the stray cat from using it as a litter box 13 x research source make sure to use a covering that the stray cat cannot easily scratch or tear through such as tarp visit your local home improvement store to purchase a durable material with which to cover the sandbox block access to areas under your house a stray cat may keep coming back to your yard because he has found a safe area under your porch or deck where he could comfortably hide installing chicken wire or latticework could be very effective in preventing the stray cat from making a home under your house 14 x research source if you do not have already have these materials at home you can purchase them at your local home improvement store remove any potential food sources from your yard bird feeders and catnip can attract stray cats to your yard 15 x research source if you really enjoy having birds come to your yard but do not want to remove the bird feeders you may have to invest in a fence to keep stray cats and other animals in your yard this could be a very expensive and time consuming endeavor so removing the bird feeders would be the easier and less expensive solution trap the stray cat before attempting to trap the stray cat try approaching him to if he is safe to get near and physically handle if he is approachable then you can purchase a humane trap at your local animal store and set it up in a part of your yard that has plenty of shade even with the stray cat being approachable you should still contact your local animal control or feline rescue organization for instructions on how to safely trap him 16 x research source do not attempt to trap the stray cat if you cannot safely approach him if you cannot get near him without him trying to attack you contact your local animal control or feline rescue organization to remove him from your yard a terrified stray cat can inflict serious injury on you so you do not want to put yourself in danger 17 x research source if you are going to trap him yourself make sure that you are wearing thick gloves and long sleeves 18 x research source if you do not have thick gloves already you can purchase them at your local hardware store or home improvement store when the stray cat is trapped in the cage immediately take him to your local animal control center if you are not comfortable picking up the cage contact the local animal control to pick it up for you placing the cage in the shade would keep the stray cat out of direct sunlight in case a long period of time passes between him being trapped and being transported to the animal control center look for the stray cat s identification if you are able to approach the stray cat check to see if he has a collar if he has one check the identification tag for the owner s name and contact information if you are able to touch him check to see if has a microchip 19 x research source which is another way to identify and contact his owner,Pets-and-Animals
how to preserve a starfish for a decoration,starfish make for great decorations when you bring them home from the beach to avoid stinking up your centerpiece though it helps to learn to preserve them properly drying them out with alcohol and learning to display them properly it s easy see step 1 for more information,make sure the starfish you find are dead already of the nearly 1500 species of starfish in the world they all have one thing in common they re slow it can be very difficult to tell if a starfish you find is living or dead but you can look for a few key signs that you ll be paying tribute to the beautiful animal by preserving it not killing it if you come across a starfish on the beach wait to touch it look at it closely is there any movement is there any bubbling from the sand underneath if so do it a favor by returning it into the water watch closely for several minutes to look for signs of life before picking it up if the starfish is brittle and unmoving it s dead and safe to take home for preservation and decoration 1 x research source clean your starfish an optional step before preserving the starfish is to take some time to clean it up for display while not essential some collectors like to submerge the starfish in slightly soapy water and dry it thoroughly before soaking in alcohol or drying in salt if you want to do a pre soak dilute a tiny squirt of liquid detergent in several cups of water and soak the starfish to get it clean don t scrub or otherwise over handle the starfish which is fragile dry the starfish thoroughly in the sun taking care to weigh down each arm of the starfish they tend to curl up some as they dry so it s important to flatten them gently between two plates to maintain a uniform flatness preserve your starfish with alcohol generally most collectors will go straight to the alcohol soak but do whatever seems appropriate for the specimen you ve collected when you get your starfish home soak it in enough isopropyl rubbing alcohol to cover the starfish and leave it alone for 30 48 hours alternatively some choose to soak their starfish in formalin one part formaldehyde and five parts water if you do this be warned that the starfish will maintain a fairly strong chemical odor for a while until it dissipates somewhat it might not matter if you re going to put it behind glass but be aware the process for this method is the same dry the starfish in the sun whatever series of steps you do to prepare the starfish and whatever you soak it in you need to let it dry very thoroughly in the sun before taking it inside especially hot sunny days are perfect for drying starfish and ensuring that they ll last weigh them down with plates you shouldn t need to weight them with books or any extra weight to ensure that the arms stay flat and even check on them regularly to make sure it s drying in the shape you want if you want it to look a certain way for display purposes 2 x research source try preserving starfish with salt one easy alternative method of preserving the starfish is to lay it out flat on a plate and cover it with a generous sprinkling of natural sea salt top it with a plate to keep the arms straight the salt crusting can work to suck any moisture out of the starfish and dry it out preserving it quite nicely you might consider doing this outside in the sun to avoid any smell and to dry it out more quickly keep them dry whatever you end up doing with your starfish displaying prominently or using for a craft project make sure it stays dry and has time to dry down to a lower level of stinky ness there shouldn t be a considerable odor but it can carry with it the smell of the alcohol for a while after you preserve it keep it in a dry place and don t jostle it too much create an ocean life shadowbox a common way to display starfish is alongside other shells urchins sand dollars and driftwood in a decorative shadowbox this can be a nice accent to an office living room or other space especially in houses near the beach use it to accent a gift wrapping instead of a bow use a starfish gluing a preserved starfish can be a cool way to highlight your gift wrapping you could also hang it with ribbon from a gift bag to liven up the package pair it with an ocean themed present for an added touch use it to decorate your dining room table creating an ocean themed centerpiece for your table is a nice way to use your preserved starfish placing shells and starfish in a simple and elegant bowl looks nice on your table from christmas to summer reminding you of the beach glue starfish to napkin rings for a nice livening up of the place setting ornament wine glass stems with starfish by tying them gently to the glass with ribbon make sure you remove them before washing the glasses fill a glass jar one of the simplest and most elegant ways to display your starfish and other sea preserves is to just fill a glass it looks nice inside or outside in formal settings or on end tables it s an instant reminder of sunny days and waves create a starfish pin carry your starfish with you by creating a nice broach or a pin and wearing it prominently clip it to your beach bag or your purse your scarf or your jacket,Pets-and-Animals
how to help stop cruelty towards animals,many people feel great compassion towards animals but are unsure where to start in preventing cruelty towards them there are a variety of ways you can help in the fight against animal cruelty and some of those options are reviewed below remember that education awareness and direct action all come into play when stopping cruelty towards animals,avoid products that are tested on animals a variety of products from cosmetics to pharmaceutical drugs are tested on animals animal rights advocates disagree with the use of such products for a variety of reasons testing causes painful physical side effects for animals lab conditions are often cramped and unpleasant and animals are often killed or die unintentionally during the process 1 x research source know what products are likely to be tested on animals and avoid such products olay one of the world s largest skin care companies carries out 400 000 skin care safety tests each year many of which are likely conducted on animals 2 x research source avon a cosmetics company does not conduct tests on animals as a company but many of their ingredients come from outside facilities known for animal testing 3 x research source garnier known for shampoo and make up is one of the most well known users of animal testing for their products 4 x research source neutrogena a skin care company

how to make a shrimp aquarium,freshwater shrimp can make great pets shrimp like ghost shrimp and cherry shrimp are about as hardy as many fish and offer a visually striking alternative to traditional fish tanks the small tank requirements make fresh water shrimp a great choice for offices classrooms or your living room it is not recommended to house shrimp with other fish unless you are using them as a food source as fresh water shrimp are extremely susceptible to predators,choose the right shrimp for you there are lots of species of shrimp to choose from when making a shrimp tank all shrimp are more susceptible to issues with water quality than fish 1 x research source ghost shrimp also called glass shrimp are one of the easiest breeds of shrimp to raise they are translucent see through and highly active ghost shrimp are also very affordable cherry shrimp are usually green and brown but there are red varieties available for purchase they are slightly more expensive than ghost shrimp but require similar care choose the right fish tank there are many options to choose from for shrimp tanks choosing a tank that is at least ten gallons will ensure you have enough space for your shrimp to flourish 2 x research source make sure to note the size of your tank you will need to use that figure to calculate flow rate in your choice of water filter a ten gallon tank is often sufficient for even a large population of shrimp choose the right aquarium filter you will need to determine the required flow rate for your tank pet stores can often help you choose the right filter for your tank you can also use one of the many free volume calculators available online to help you choose shrimp waste is often very small so you ll need an effective filter to catch this 3 x research source you will need to know the volume and dimensions of your tank to use volume calculators try using the free volume calculator at http aquariuminfo org volumecalculator html to determine your filter needs in tank filters like lee s 10 premium undergravel filter and the emperor pro series bio wheel are good options the fluval 406 canister filter is also good and mounts externally sponge filters are recommended if you are going to create an ongoing colony of shrimp as the shrimplets will not be sucked in as they would with a hang on back filter intake shrimp also enjoy picking debris off sponge filters install a tank heater you can also find online calculators to help you determine which water heater to purchase it is important to choose a water heater that is rated appropriately to heat a tank the size of yours pet stores can help you identify the right heater for your tank generally it s better to round up on the required wattage of your water heater purchasing two equal wattage water heaters to place on either side of the tank can increase efficiency and ensure the tank remains warm if one heater fails add substrate to the floor of the tank most plant substrates come ready to be placed in your aquarium upon purchase gravel substrates may require multiple cleanings before they are free of dust and debris 4 x research source you can buy shrimp ready substrate at most pet stores use enough substrate to fill the bottom of the aquarium to about an inch try to leave the area at the front of the tank clear so shrimp will congregate in a visible area but feel free to vary the depth of the substrate otherwise treat the water as necessary to make it safe for shrimp if you buy water from the pet store that is made for aquariums you may not need to treat it tap water will require treatment to ensure it is safe for shrimp 5 x research source test your chlorine levels using a test you get from a pet store if chlorine is present use a commercial dechlorinator to remove all traces of it nitrate and ammonia levels should be zero pet stores sell water treatment kits to help reduce nitrate and ammonia the ph range of your water should stay within 6 0 and 7 5 fill the tank and check for leaks before you begin filling the tank and installing fixtures check your tank for leaks fill the tank a few inches and wait to see if the seals hold you can do this with untreated water if you intend to empty it again new fist tanks should always be checked for leaks before placing animals in them filling the tank completely before you check for leaks could lead to a much larger mess if the seal on the tank fails choose between a planted or non planted food setup a planted food set up requires the inclusion of living plants inside your shrimp tank a non planted tank will need more attention as you will need to feed the shrimp yourself 6 x research source low light planted tanks can grow moss and ferns to provide their shrimp with a food source higher light planted setups can use living substrates and grow rotala on the walls of the tank to provide shrimp with food non planted setups will need less water quality maintenance but will require you to feed the shrimp yourself more often add lighting for your shrimp and plants you will need to choose the correct form of lighting for you tank based on the plants you have chosen be aware that some light options may increase the temperature of your tank s water 7 x research source non planted tanks will only need a common led tank light available at most pet stores planted setups will need lighting appropriate for your choices in plants metal halides fluorescents or led lights are all good options look for light sources that are around 6500 kelvins to approximate the sun s rays for plant growth cycle your tank for 2 8 weeks before adding any shrimp you will need to cycle your tank for some time cycling is simply allowing your tank to operate as it will once your shrimp are introduced this is important to establish a bacteria base in your water and filters tanks that are not cycled properly may kill shrimp entering the environment 8 x research source ensure the aquarium light is set to be on for only eight hours per day to avoid overgrowth of algae test the water bi weekly for ph ammonia nitrate and chlorine re treat the water if necessary test the water quality and temperature although you should have been testing the water bi weekly throughout cycling test it again before adding any shrimp to it poor water quality or extreme temperature can quickly kill young shrimp make sure the is no chlorine ammonia or nitrates present in the water ensure the ph of the water is between 6 0 and 7 5 check the water temperature shrimp need water that is between 65 and 80 degrees fahrenheit to survive siphon water from the tank into a large bowl containing your shrimp when you buy your shrimp they will come in a bag or container with water they are already accustomed to pour that water with the shrimp into a large bowl and use a siphon to drip water from the tank into the bowl mixing the water will help them adjust to a new environment use air line tubing like that used on tank filters to siphon water from the tank to the bowl 9 x research source aquariuminfo org rcs html place the bowl at a lower level than the tank then put one end of the hose in the tank s water suck gently on the other end of the tube until water starts to flow from the tank to the bowl fold the hose over and use a rubber band to kink it so only a few drops come from the tube at a time allow the tank to drip into the bowl for thirty minutes use a net to transplant the shrimp to the tank after you ve given the shrimp enough time to adjust to the water of the tank use a small tank net to scoop the shrimp out of the bowl and place them into the tank 10 x research source be careful not to crush any shrimp as you attempt to get them all from the bowl place your hand over the open side of the net as you transfer the shrimp to prevent them from jumping out if a shrimp jumps out of the net scoop it up gently and place it in the tank as quickly as you can feed your shrimp if you have a planted aquarium setup you will still need to provide food for your shrimp from time to time to make sure they receive all the nutrients they need non planted tanks will require daily feeding for your shrimp 11 x research source boiled vegetables like zucchini and spinach are great for a shrimp s health processed shrimp foods that come in flakes or pellets are designed to provide shrimp with the nutrition they need you can find these foods at most pet stores try to only use sinking foods maintain the water quality now that your shrimp are safely in their new home it s up to you to keep up with tank maintenance make sure the water quality doesn t diminish now that the shrimp have been added 12 x research source make sure the nitrate ammonia and chlorine levels all stay at

how to create lobster farms,lobster is a delicious seafood enjoyed by many people around the world and farming lobster can be a very lucrative endeavor lobster farming is a method that has been used since the early 20th century to meet the high demand for meat from these crustaceans a healthy place to live clean water and lobster feed can help your lobsters grow a bit of knowledge about the lobster business can help make your farm a success,find a suitable location for your farm a successful location for a lobster farm will require 3 things enough space to set up several troughs a source of clean water free from pollutants and waste and a nearby source of lobster larvae look for a location with all 3 of these vital characteristics 1 x research source although your farm does not need to border the ocean if you are not close to an ocean it will be difficult for you to obtain lobster larvae since they do not ship well natural sunlight also helps lobsters grow so outdoor troughs are ideal most lobsters live in salt water so your you will either need a direct source of seawater or you can purchase a kit to salinate the clean water you have rent or purchase the land for your farm once you have located the best place for your farm rent or purchase the land since you will be using troughs to house your lobsters you will not need to make modifications to the land for this reason both renting and purchasing property will work fine of course if you have the means to buy a property this is a better investment in your business the land does not need to be directly on the water if the land borders a source of salt water this can be helpful but it is not crucial check with your department of natural resources to find out if you need a permit locate the department of natural resources for your area this could be run by your city county or state province contact the dnr and inquire about any lobster farm regulations if you are required to have a permit fill out the necessary forms pay any fees and acquire your permit before you begin farming 2 x research source set up troughs to house your lobsters provide a good environment on the lobster farm by purchasing several solid troughs these will not only keep the lobsters contained on the farm they will also keep them safe from outside predators place the troughs side by side in even rows so that each 1 is easily accessible fill your troughs with clean saltwater 3 x research source alternatively if your lobster farm has direct access to salt water you can house your lobsters in ocean pens you can stock 10 lobsters weighing 0 15 0 2 kilograms 0 33 0 44 lb in a 1 m2 11 sq ft trough pen troughs can be purchased from some farm supply stores or online maintain a water salinity of 30 000 35 000 parts per million if you will be using municipal water condition this water in order to remove chlorine and other minerals use a commercial marine life salt mix follow the instructions to achieve a salinity of 30 000 35 000 parts per million and use a test kit to ensure that you ve done everything right use natural seawater if possible add more saline to increase the salinity dilute with filtered water to lower the salinity maintain a a ph between 6 5 and 8 5 use a ph test kit to the determine the ph level of your water if the ph is to low add 1 teaspoon 4 9 ml of baking soda per 19 litres 5 0 us gal wait a few hours and test again if the ph is too high place a mesh bag of peat moss into your filter let it run for 2 days before testing again do not add your lobsters to the tank until the ph is correct perform weekly maintenance to keep your troughs clean each week remove 10 15 of the water in your troughs and replace it with conditioned salinated water purchase a basic water testing kit and use it check the water s ph and level of salinity once a week take a look at your filters once a week as well rinse your filters when needed replace your filters if they appear worn damaged or if they do not seem to be working effectively always condition municipal water before adding it to your troughs provide good filtration to circulate oxygen and remove waste a couple of good filters and a pump can keep your water clean and filled with oxygen this helps your lobsters to grow and prevents disease from spreading a gravity percolation filter system will de gas and oxygenate your water a mechanical biological filter will remove waste from the water supply and or convert it to a less toxic nitrate that is safe for the lobsters finally a submersible pump will circulate water through the filtration systems purchase these filters and install them in you lobster troughs 4 x research source keeping water clean and filtered is necessary to protect lobsters from disease which can spread very quickly through a farm purchase filters and pumps from local farm supply stores or online purchase larvae from a local supplier suppliers of lobster larvae can be found in hatcheries on the atlantic coast of north america the uk the philippines new zealand and many other places that are near the coast once a lobster hatches from its shell it is tiny transparent has large eyes and a spiny body this is larvae and it will move through 4 stages of larvae before becoming a recognizable lobster select from whatever varieties of lobster are available in your area choosing a supplier that is located near your farm prevents damage to the lobsters during the transportation avoid stocking larger types of lobster larvae with smaller types the larger lobster larvae can eat the smaller ones provide lobster feed once a day keep the lobsters healthy and growing by feeding them in the wild lobsters eat small crustaceans mollusks and fish appropriate lobster feed can be purchased from the supplier of your larvae or ordered online if you can t find lobster food blends you can use cod feed follow the instructions on your packaging for serving sizes 5 x research source try to secure a reliable source of lobster feed before you begin your farm use 2 by 2 inches 5 1 cm 5 1 cm netting to keep your lobsters safe provide netting over your troughs to prevent your lobsters from escaping you can also place bamboo slats on the top of the troughs for added security this will help keep your lobster hatchlings safe from predators like birds 6 x research source netting can be purchased at many home improvement stores or online locate buyers for your lobsters contact local grocery stores and restaurants directly ideally in person and offer to sell them your lobsters do this prior to your lobster harvest create a contact that outlines the terms of your agreement with a given grocery store restaurant including the approximate number of lobsters they will purchase the price and the approximate date of delivery 7 x research source it is important to deliver lobsters as soon as they are harvested so it is crucial to have your buyers in place ahead of time harvest your lobsters lobsters can be harvested after about 6 7 months once they reach a weight of 0 8 1 kilogram 1 8 2 2 lb lobsters can be scooped from their troughs using nets place newly harvested lobsters in a basin filled with seawater prior to packing 8 x research source try not to harvest lobsters when it is raining lobsters can die if they are exposed to freshwater transport your lobsters with care lobsters are purchased and transported live so they can be killed immediately prior to consumption this means that lobsters must be packaged and delivered very carefully wrap your lobsters in cloth soaked with seawater and pack them in styrofoam boxes never pack lobsters in fresh water to keep lobsters fresh store the styrofoam boxes in ice deliver lobster as soon as possible after harvest work with a veterinarian to reduce instances of disease if any of your lobsters should become diseased this can wipe out the entire harvest work with a veterinarian to find out ways to reduce this risk ask a vet to evaluate your lobsters to catch any health problems early 9 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to take care of your fish tanks,fish come in all different shapes and sizes making them some of the coolest pets to own fortunately fish are pretty easy to take care of as long as you choose fish that go well together and put them in a big enough tank set up the tank with some basic equipment like a filter then clean it often to keep your fish swimming along happily,start with tropical fish if your aquarium is heated most aquarium fish sold in stores are tropical fish there are many types to choose from including neon tetras guppies and bettas these fish need a consistent aquarium heater in order to survive many warm water fish serve as a beautiful but low maintenance addition to an aquarium 1 x research source maintaining the water temperature is very important for this type of fish check the heater often and consider getting an aquarium thermometer select coldwater fish if your aquarium isn t heated goldfish and minnows are a few popular fish for aquariums without heaters many subtropical fish survive well in cool aquariums in addition some tropical fish are hardy enough to live without a heater loaches minnows danios and even crayfish and shrimp live in cooler waters 2 x research source coldwater fish tend to be hardier than tropical fish but they often need more room a well kept goldfish will grow much bigger than you expect coldwater fish often require a water temperature a little below what tropical fish need a goldfish for instance requires water between 65 and 72 f 18 and 22 c raise saltwater fish for hardier pets that require more maintenance saltwater fish are a little trickier to maintain than freshwater fish saltwater fish tend to be more expensive and require you to keep a close watch on the aquarium s salinity level if you are willing to watch the salinity saltwater fish are almost as easy to care for as any tropical breed 3 x research source some examples of saltwater fish include firefish yellow shrimp goby klein s butterfly fish and coral beauty angelfish metal components in saltwater will rust over time get a tank and equipment designed for use with saltwater to reduce rusting pick fish that go well together in a tank you may feel tempted to fill your tank with whatever colorful species you can find before choosing a fish read up about what fish go well together stick to a limited number of fish from a few species avoiding any that are territorial or predatory try to get fish that originated from the same part of the world since they are more likely to live together peacefully in nature 4 x research source if you re unsure about which fish to get ask employees at the pet store for advice for example betta fish are known as fighting fish they are territorial around other bettas in addition they will attack other species that nibble at their fins they coexist with neon tetras and corydoras goldfish sometimes eat fish smaller than them they live well with rosy barbs loaches and danios but may still attack them at times pick an appropriately sized tank for the fish you wish to keep larger tanks are much easier to maintain and work well for any fish you plan on including in your aquarium when something goes wrong with the tank such as a problem with the ph the change is much slower in a larger tank than in a smaller tank in addition larger tanks provide spaces for individual fish or schools 5 x research source if you re unsure what size you need select a fish breed you like and research its needs bigger fish needs bigger tanks for example a small fish like a tetra or guppy needs a minimum of 5 gallons 19 l of water a school of these fish need a minimum of 15 gallons 57 l get a 20 gallons 76 l tank to hold goldfish choose a tank that holds an extra 10 gallons 38 l for every additional goldfish you plan on keeping 6 x research source use a tank that holds 10 gallons 38 l of water to keep a clownfish increase the tank size to 60 gallons 230 l to hold a school of them set the tank away from sources of heat and cold temperature fluxes have dangerous effects on both tank water and glass some parts of your home to avoid include open windows letting in direct sunlight drafty basements furnaces and fireplaces find a spot where the temperature and sunlight stay level throughout the day 7 x research source remember that fish tanks are controlled environments any little change may have drastic effects sunlight for example warms water and facilitates algae growth level out the tank so it doesn t crack when you add water set the tank on a stable surface then use a bubble level to test it place the bubble on the top edges of the tank the bubble in the center of the level will move to the side if the tank is uneven water will also flow towards the uneven side putting extra pressure on the glass 8 x research source getting the tank perfectly level is difficult put the tank on a level stand on flat ground to get it as level as possible put wooden shims underneath the tank to make small elevation adjustments install an aquarium heater and filter system in the tank you will need these submersible systems in order to regulate the waters for your fish first choose systems rated as compatible with the size of tank you have assemble the components such as by pushing the filter inside its tube housing most heaters and filters are easy to install since all you have to do is drape them over the walls of the tank and plug them into a wall outlet 9 x research source if you aren t going to get a filter change 25 of the tank water every day if you would like a little extra help with cleaning the tank you may want to invest in some shrimp snails or cory catfish check compatibility with your tank heaters and filters are available in different models some manufacturers for example require you to place the filter underneath gravel heaters have adjustable settings you twist the knob on the heater to determine how hot it makes the water the setting you choose depends on what your fish need tropical aquariums usually need to be between 75 and 80 f 24 and 27 c for instance add a substrate to the tank and plant decorations in it spread enough aquarium gravel or sand to hide the bottom of the tank rinse all the decorations in warm tap water before pushing them into the gravel press them down into the gravel until they stick in place 10 x research source if your fish likes to burrow get tiny pieces of stone and gravel make sure it s lightweight so it won t crush the fish avoid using sand for fish that like to burrow since it would get stuck in their fins and gills include plastic decorations like a castle or a pirate ship for variety and shelter in the tank when choosing aquarium plants consider the tank s environment plants like water wisteria amazon sword hornwort and java fern do well in tropical freshwater tanks but aren t appropriate for saltwater tanks fill the tank with lukewarm tap water and dechlorinate it since you don t have any fish in the tank yet add the tap water directly to it fill it all the way up then add some water conditioner into the water follow the manufacturer s instructions to add the appropriate amount for the size of tank you own when the water is ready scoop some up and pour it into the tank s filter to get it ready 11 x research source water conditioner is available at pet supply stores don t use dechlorinators like those made for pools get a product designed for fish water the water needs to be lukewarm so it doesn t damage the tank don t let cracked glass ruin your fish s new home mix marine salt into the water if the tank is for saltwater fish purchase salt made for use in fish tanks then follow the manufacturer s instructions to treat the water with the right amount depending on the product you may need about 5 5 cups of salt 1501 5 g of salt for every 16 cups 3 800 ml of water stir the water thoroughly with an aquarium net or another tool 12 x research source you will need to repeat this process whenever you add fresh water to the tank run the tank s systems for at least 24 hours before adding fish doing a fishless cycle with the tank s heat lights and filter gives beneficial bacteria a chance to grow fish uneaten food and rotting plants give off nitrogen some bacteria converts nitrogen to nitrates while a second type of bacteria converts the nitrites to harmless nitrates these bacteria need some time to get established in the tank 13 x research source if you add the fish too soon you will see a significant spike in nitrogen and nitrates when you test the water this could be harmful to your fish for saltwater fish give the tank at least 3 weeks for it to cycle if you have time set the tank up in advance and let it cycle for a few extra weeks to ensure your new pets are safe feed fish a little bit of food twice a day the amount of food you need to add depends on the size of your fish and how many of them you have start out with small amounts of food so you don t overfeed them fish generally need about 3 to 5 fish food pellets or a similar amount of fish flakes feed the fish at the same time every day 14 x research source overfeeding is a serious problem that harms fish fish generally eat themselves sick any food they miss ends up rotting in the tank leading to problems like algae growth read about the dietary needs of the species you keep each species is different scrub algae off the tank walls every other week get an algae brush sponge or scraper from a pet supply store scrubbers have a rough pad for brushing off algae and a sharper edge for scraping off stubborn remnants work from the bottom up letting the algae fall to the tank floor then vacuum it up with an aquarium siphon algae consumes oxygen that your fish and aquarium plants need to survive so remove green spots as soon as you see them forming 15 x research source some places also sell algae magnets to use the magnet you hold it against the outside surface of the aquarium then vacuum up the algae like usual another way to deal with algae is by keeping a snail or algae eating fish in the tank test the water ph and makeup at least once a month purchase a water testing kit designed for aquariums testing strips are the easiest to use since all you have to do is dunk the testing strip into the aquarium water other tests require you to take water samples then mix it with a drop of the included dye follow the testing instructions to ensure the environment is right for your fish friends 16 x research source freshwater fish prefer a ph level between 5 5 and 7 5 saltwater fish need a ph level over 8 0 each species of fish has different needs so do some research online to find the perfect level ideally the water will have 0 ammonia 0 nitrite and 5 to 10 parts per million of nitrate if you have saltwater fish make sure your kit tests for water salinity the ideal level is 35 parts per thousand vacuum the gravel with a siphon at least twice a month fish tank siphons are long tubes with a vacuum at the end set the free end of the tube in a large bucket you use only for aquarium maintenance then press the vacuum lightly against the gravel use it to collect debris in the gravel such as uneaten fish food and algae 17 x research source return any siphoned gravel to the fish tank if it looks dirty rinse it off in some of the siphoned tank water wash your hands before handling the gravel so you don t introduce bacteria to the tank replace from 15 25 of the tank water every1 2 weeks use your gravel vacuum to drain some of the water into a big bucket it is suggested not to remove the fish from the tank because it can give your fish stress then prepare to replace the lost water with an equal amount of clean water the old water can be disposed of or re purposed such as to water any plants in your home 18 x research source the best time to do a water change is when you re vacuuming the gravel the vacuum will suck up some water so combine the tasks aim on removing 10 to 15 of the water if you vacuum the tank weekly do not use soap or any chemicals if you are cleaning the tank with the fish still inside refill the tank with warm dechlorinated water put the water in a bucket first before adding it to the tank check it with a thermometer to make sure it s at a similar temperature to the water in the tank then treat it with some bottled water conditioner from a pet supply store read the manufacturer s instructions for the recommended amount to mix into the water 19 x research source treat the water with supplies you only use for the aquarium for example use an aquarium net for a safe and easy way to mix conditioner into the water this is because any item you use elsewhere may introduce soap or bacteria into the tank water if you keep saltwater fish also mix marine salt into the replacement water according to the manufacturer s instructions rinse the filter every month and replace it when it gets dirty unplug the filter to turn it off then open it up to access its internal components you will see a cylinder or a rectangular pad inside the chamber depending on what filter you own slide the parts out and set them in a bowl filled with water from the tank swirl the filter around in the water to clean it 20 x research source this is also a good time to check the filter chamber if it looks dirty or has algae in it scrub it with an algae brush and water from the tank if the filter pad still looks dirty after rinsing it replace it another way to tell is by how slowly water cycles through the tank a slowed water flow is often a sign of a clogged filter which is fixable with a new filter pad and some scrubbing,Pets-and-Animals
how to train a ferret not to bite,nipping also known as biting is a common behavior for ferrets they bite for different reasons and young ferrets do not even realize that biting can be hurtful you

at the ferret and say no in a loud and firm voice 2 x research source 3 x research source your ferret will probably struggle and try to move around don t be alarmed you are not hurting the ferret put the ferret in time out if scruffing does not work put your ferret in time out put the ferret in a travel carrier or cage for 5 minutes or less this method works best for baby ferrets i e kits because they are very playful and do not like being alone time out will help your ferret associate biting with something bad 4 x research source your ferret may go to sleep if you leave it in the cage for too long during time out your ferret needs to associate the cage with punishment not with nap time distract your ferret kits often get overly excited when they play and will begin to bite if your ferret

attention to play or to be put down to break the kit from biting to be put down 12 x research source hold the ferret so it is unable to bite you keep holding it even if it squirms put the kit down once it stops squirming praise the kit and tell it how good it has been build trust with adult ferrets adult ferrets bite because they were not trained properly when they were younger and or they have problems trusting humans they will need direct skin to fur contact when you handle them it will take a few months to train them to stop biting but you need to be consistent firm and gentle with them 13 x research source adult ferrets bite much harder than kits but still try to provide as much skin to fur contact as possible adult ferrets may be suspicious and nervous when being handled deal with a fear biter if a ferret was handled roughly as a kit or lacks confidence it may be a fear biter punishing a fear biter may actually reinforce the idea that they should be afraid of people you should

get your attention ignore the ferret if your ferret bites you when it is ready to put it down hold the ferret for a few seconds longer before you put it down putting down the ferret right after it bites you will reinforce the behavior some ferrets do not like being held for long periods of time pay attention to how your ferret responds,Pets-and-Animals
how to tell if a dog is microchipped,microchips placed in dogs are small passive radio emitters about the size of a grain of rice that are injected under the skin above the shoulder blades each microchip has a unique number and that number is registered on an official central database along with a description of that dog the owner s name address and contact phone numbers 1 x research source when a scanner is passed over the microchip that unique number is picked up and displayed on the scanner knowing if a dog has a microchip is especially helpful if you find a stray dog and need to trace the owner 2 x research source,look for a tag on the dog s collar if the dog is wearing a collar take a look to see if it has a specific tag that says the dog is microchipped microchips are made by different manufacturers and these companies usually issue a metal tags to place on the dog s collar to alert interested parties that the dog is chipped 3 x research source the tag is supplied in part to let anyone that finds a dog know that it is chipped in order to scan them but it is also a visual deterrent to potential thieves thinking of stealing the dog since the dog has permanent id as belonging to someone else 4 x research source if the dog does not have an official id tag on their collar look for a bespoke collar tag bearing wording such as i am microchipped or microchipped know that this is not the same as a tag engraved with the dog s name and phone number the purpose of this tag is purely to alert the finder that the dog is chipped and should be scanned this type of tag usually does not carry personal details feel for the microchip if the dog has lost their collar or there is no tag on the collar try gently feeling for the presence of the microchip the microchip is encased in a perspex coat that is the size and shape of a grain of rice microchips are injected under the skin in the loose skin of the neck at the centerline between the shoulder blades therefore this is the ideal place to start feeling 5 x research source run your fingertips over the skin between the shoulder blades and neck apply gentle pressure to see if you can detect a firm rice grain sized object just under the skin microchips do bed in which means they can migrate slightly from the original implant site to reduce the chance of missing a microchip work in a methodical manner working up and down between shoulder and head and then left to right working side to side from the shoulders up the neck until every inch is covered this is not a foolproof method if you can t feel a chip it does not mean the dog is definitely not chipped because the chip may be present but have shifted location or is embedded too deeply to feel get a definitive answer by getting the dog scanned even if the dog doesn t have a tag that says it has a chip and you don t feel one it s best to scan the dog to find out it is worth scanning for a microchip if you are trying to get the contact details of a lost dog s owner x ray the dog microchips show up on x ray while this is not routinely used as a method to check if a chip is present in cases where a chip was implanted and has stopped working taking a radiograph of the dog is a quick and easy way to check the chip is still in place but not working check the scanner first the operator needs to check that the scanner is working by pressing the on button and passing the sensor over a test chip if the scanner bleeps and displays a number it is working if the batteries are dead the display will either remain blank or display a message low battery if the scanner is working but has not scanned a microchip after a set period of time it displays the message no chip found scan the dog s shoulders turn on the scanner and hold it one inch above the skin move the scanner in up and down sweeps from the shoulder to neck and then from side to side when the scanner activates make a note of the number check other places on the dog s body if no chip is found with a methodical scanning pattern over the shoulders don t give up pass the scanner over the remainder of the body this includes under the sternum and around the armpits just in case it has migrated to an unusual location,Pets-and-Animals
how to keep ants out of pet food,when ants invade your pet s food the pet may refuse to eat when ants invade food stored inside you might end up with a pest problem inside your home these instructions will help you ant proof your pet s food helping prevent such infestations in addition to helping keep ants out of your pet s food moreover you may be worried that ants will end up in food you put out for wildlife around your home these instructions also include steps to keeping ants out of these foods the key is to create a chemical barrier that ants will not cross and which will not be harmful to pets wild birds or any other animals you wish to feed,store extra food in sealed containers 1 x research source coffee cans tupperware and resealable zipper storage bags are some examples of containers that will help keep ants out you may find that an additional container inside of another will be an even more effective barrier food stored in a resealable zipper storage bag and placed inside an airtight container provides a strong barrier against ants 2 x research source create a moat barrier set clean food dishes in a pan of water not too deep such as a cake pan the pan of water will act as a moat and keep the ants out 3 x research source another solution is to use two stainless pet food dishes one slightly larger than the other use industrial strength glue to attach a small piece of brick or very flat stone to the underside of the smaller dish wait for the glue to dry and put water in the larger dish place the smaller dish with attached brick or stone into the larger dish of water the water serves as a moat keeping ants out of the food and the brick or stone helps keep the food dish from tipping over while raising it well above the water level 4 x research source set the dish with moat in a different area for two days or more the ants will eventually stop returning to the normal feeding place purchase ant proof pet food dishes several pet food dishes are available for purchase that are purported to protect against ant infiltration some of these dishes are meant for indoors and some have even been developed for outdoor use choose the dish that will work best for your pet whether an indoor or outdoor pet a dog cat or other pet some standalone moats are also available into which you can place your existing food dish thereby protecting the food from ants keep the area around food dishes clean keep pet food dishes on a removable surface such as a placemat and remove to clean after meals ants follow a pheromone trail given off as they walk to direct them back to food sources cleaning the surface on which the food dish sits and the dish itself with soap and water disrupts the pheromone trail thus discouraging ants from returning 5 x research source use peppermint oil mix a ratio of one tablespoon of 100 peppermint oil to one cup of water and mix in a spray bottle spray near the hvac return vents in your home to deter pests their sense of smell will be disrupted which is what deters them after the use of peppermint oil 6 x research source another effective way of using peppermint oil to deter ants from pet food is to use drops of the oil on a cotton ball to wipe onto baseboards and other surfaces near where ants may enter the home you might also wipe the oil onto the surface around the area where pet food is stored or around the food dish 7 x research source freeze infested food if ants are already in a food dish cover the dish tightly and place in the freezer leave the food in the freezer until the it is frozen and the ants are dead 8 x research source this will allow you to remove the ants from the food while salvaging it for feeding to your pet take the dry food out of the freezer by now the ants should be dead pour the dry food into a strainer over a sink and shake back and forth vigorously until no more dead ants come out this will keep from wasting the pet food as you can now re serve it 9 x research source re store pet food after pet food is free of ants pour the food into an airtight container to protect against further infestation 10 x research source using techniques listed in method one try to prevent infestation from recurring you may have to repeat some steps to completely remove ants so keep trying if you don t succeed the first time use petroleum jelly 11 x research source to protect a feeder that sticks to the window cut a large circle or heart shape out of newspaper tape that inside your window for a pattern then use your finger to draw a vaseline barrier on the outside of the window place the feeder in the center this method is best used in a cool shady area in warm weather the vaseline will start to run drip make a petroleum jelly barrier for a hanging feeder for a hanging feeder cut a hole in the center of a lid to a tub of margarine or other small lightweight object and string the hanging cord of the feeder through the hole make a knot in the cord if necessary to hold the lid in place smear petroleum jelly on the lid or other object the ants may get to the lid but they will not make it to the feeder and other ants will not make the attempt 12 x research source use flypaper wrap a band of ribbon flypaper on the feeder pole or place on window or custom mounts flypaper has glue on both sides so ants will not cross the paper keep the fly paper away from the feeder so that birds do not make contact if flypaper comes off in high heat hold it up with small pieces of duct tape that have no smooth surface exposed for ants to crawl on 13 x research

how to bottle feed an orphaned fawn,if you see a baby deer fawn all alone in the wild assume it s healthy and its mother is nearby unless you have clear evidence to the contrary then and only then you should take action contact a wildlife rehabilitator and follow their instructions which may include bottle feeding the fawn an electrolyte drink for hydration and later goat s milk or a milk substitute for nutrition,leave a healthy looking fawn alone unless you re sure it needs help just because you see a fawn by itself at the edge of the woods that does not mean it s an orphan that needs your help in most cases the fawn s mother is likely hiding nearby and you ll do more harm than good by trying to provide unnecessary assistance 1 x research source if you know the fawn s mother is deceased for instance because you see its body nearby or the fawn is visibly injured or very frail looking then you can assume it is an orphan in need if you re not sure and you re able to observe the fawn keep an eye on it regularly for at least 6 hours if you never see the mother during this time it s increasingly likely that the fawn is an orphan contact a wildlife rehabilitator before taking action unless the fawn is in immediate danger take a few minutes to get in touch with a professional wildlife rehabilitator before you do anything they can guide you through the best way to respond or not respond and may ask for you to wait for them to arrive 2 x research source to find a wildlife rehabilitator in your area call your government s department for the environment natural resources and or wildlife or use websites such as https ahnow org and http wildliferehabinfo org index htm if the fawn is standing on a busy roadway for example take action before calling the wildlife rehabilitator use a heavy blanket to transport the fawn to a safe warm location if the wildlife rehabilitator advises you to leave the fawn in place do so otherwise wrap a heavy blanket over the fawn s shoulders and legs and carefully pick it up even small fawns can pack a powerful kick so hold it securely 3 x research source if you re near home for example you might carry it to your garage it s not advisable to put a fawn into a vehicle unless you have no other way to get it to an animal rehabilitator the rehabilitator recommends it and your vehicle has ample space inside pick up the feeding supplies you ll need don t try to use baby bottles and especially not cow s milk to feed a fawn and don t try to bottle feed the fawn at all unless specifically directed to do so by the wildlife rehabilitator you ll need the following supplies many of which you re most likely to find at a feed store or other retailer that services the farming industry 4 x research source goat lamb bottle feeding nipples which usually will fit onto plastic water bottles if not get feeding bottles as well goat or wildlife milk replacer which you add to water or goat s milk do not use cow s milk pediatric electrolyte drink e g pedialyte for dehydration in children you can get this at any drugstore or grocery store add 2 4 fl oz 59 118 ml of a pediatric electrolyte drink to a bottle if when the fawn is standing its shoulder is roughly even with your knee it will likely drink this amount per feeding if it s an older larger fawn up to around your waist increase the amount to 4 6 fl oz 120 180 ml 5 x research source a wildlife rehabilitator who you should contact before offering any care will probably tell you to provide electrolytes for hydration before giving the fawn any milk if they give you different advice however trust their expertise and follow their directions use an empty clean water bottle soda bottle or similar bottle that a goat lamb feeding nipple fits onto any flavor of pediatric electrolyte drink will work warm the bottle until the drink is roughly body temperature place the filled bottle into a mug or bowl of hot tap water for 5 10 minutes until the liquid inside the bottle is approximately 98 100 f 37 38 c you don t have to precisely measure the temperature though if the bottle feels warm to the touch but isn t uncomfortable to hold it should be fine for feeding 6 x research source don t place the bottle in boiling or near boiling water to heat it faster as this can damage the nutrients in whatever liquid is inside in this case pediatric electrolyte solution but also goat s milk or milk replacer dribble some liquid on the fawn s lips to encourage it to drink face the fawn and bring the bottle down at an angle from above touch the bottle nipple to its lips and squeeze gently to drip some of the liquid between the lips this usually spurs the fawn to latch on to the nipple and start sucking 7 x research source if the fawn is too weak to feed or otherwise refuses let the wildlife rehabilitator know hold the bottle high so the fawn has to look up to drink keep the bottle raised up so the fawn has to extend its neck and mouth to reach it this might appear uncomfortable but it s the natural feeding position for a fawn allow it to feed until the bottle is empty or it loses interest in continuing 8 x research source pinch the skin between the fawn s shoulder blades to check for hydration about 1 hour after giving it the first bottle of pediatric electrolyte drink use 2 fingers to pinch the skin between its shoulder blades if the skin drops immediately when you let go the fawn is adequately hydrated if the skin remains pinched up briefly after you let go the fawn is still dehydrated 9 x research source this is called a skin turgor test and is useful in checking for dehydration in many kinds of animals conduct this test only if advised to do so by the wildlife rehabilitator if they ll be arriving soon to evaluate the deer they may want to conduct the test give additional electrolyte bottles if directed by the wildlife rehabilitator based on the results of the skin turgor test the wildlife rehabilitator may request that you give the fawn one or more additional bottles of pediatric electrolyte solution if so you ll likely be advised to give a bottle every 1 2 hours and to conduct the skin turgor test in between each bottle 10 x research source once the fawn is adequately hydrated based on the skin turgor test the wildlife rehabilitator may ask you to start feeding the fawn goat s milk or a milk replacer warm 2 4 fl oz 59 118 ml of goat s milk or milk replacer in the bottle if you re using goat s milk just pour it into the bottle with milk replacer you ll need to measure and add the powder to the amount of water in the bottle screw on the goat lamb nipple and pinch it shut then shake the bottle vigorously to combine 11 x research source warm the bottle contents to body temperature by placing the bottle in a bowl of hot tap water hold the bottle in your hand to estimate when it reaches body temperature a precise measurement isn t necessary use 2 4 fl oz 59 118 ml for a knee high fawn based on its shoulder height when standing and 4 6 fl oz 120 180 ml for a waist high fawn don t start giving a fawn milk unless expressly requested to do so by a wildlife rehabilitator in most cases they ll either advise not to offer anything by a bottle or to start with a pediatric electrolyte drink feed the fawn a full bottle every 3 4 hours fawns typically need to feed 6 7 times per day so plan on spacing out feedings every 3 4 hours until the wildlife rehabilitator arrives approach the fawn from the front and above dribble some of the milk between its lips so it latches on to the nipple and hold the bottle high as it drinks 12 x research source make sure you re keeping the bottle elevated so the fawn has to stretch its neck and head to reach it this replicates feeding from its mother if the fawn bleats for more milk right after a feeding or between feeding times ignore it fawns will drink until they make themselves ill if permitted to do so stimulate the fawn s bowels while feeding it if necessary fawns often need help stimulating urination and defecation if it s not urinating or defecating during or after feedings put on rubber gloves and gently rub a baby wipe or damp cloth you don t mind ruining over its anus and genitals a bowel movement will typically follow soon after 13 x research source this maneuver replicates the bowel stimulation the mother achieves through licking if the fawn still isn t defecating and urinating or if it has diarrhea contact the wildlife rehabilitator again limit bonding by feeding fawns in groups if possible every time you feed a fawn it will bond with you a little more and become less able to successfully return to the wild if you happen to have more than one fawn that needs care feeding them simultaneously feeding 2 at a time with a bottle in each hand for instance will slow down the bonding process 14 x research source think very carefully before deciding you want the fawn to bond with you and become your pet keeping a wild deer as a pet may be illegal where you live and raising a fawn to adulthood requires a great deal of effort and about 500 usd in expenses,Pets-and-Animals
how to attract dragonflies,dragonflies are large insects that are interesting attractive and fun to watch they re great at controlling mosquitos which makes them a useful backyard helper dragonflies are drawn to areas with water so the best way to attract dragonflies to your yard is to add a source of water,place a pond in your yard ponds are beautiful additions to your backyard and they attract dragonflies dragonflies are attracted to water because they breed in water their young hide among water plants if you want dragonflies in your yard put a water source somewhere in your yard create a pond at least 2 feet 0 6 m deep however a pool of just about any size will appeal to dragonflies 1 x research source the pond should have a depth of at least 2 feet 60 m to allow the dragonfly nymphs to take cover from predators such as raccoons the water source needs shallow low edges the shallow sloping sides allow for plants to grow find the right water source you can choose creative ways to put water sources into your yard if you are into landscaping you can start a big fun project where you place a premolded pond in your yard or dig and build one yourself 2 x research source you can also set up a plastic wading pool which dragonflies will breed in another idea is a wood half barrel you can find premolded ponds at home improvement stores and plastic wading pools at most toy stores or supercenters you can find both online determine if you live near a source of dragonflies you will have better luck attracting dragonflies if you live near a water source with dragonflies some dragonflies will fly miles away from the water source but the closer you are to a stream lake or other source of water the better your chances are that you will attract them 3 x research source most people who do not live in extremely arid areas should be reasonably close to a water source with dragonflies add water plants to your pond you can t just have a pond and attract dragonflies you need water plants in the pond to help attract them dragonflies love tall plants the dragonflies will lay their eggs in the plants and the larvae will live in them until they are grown then they will use the tall plants to perch on 4 x research source stock the pond with both submerged and floating plants they will use the underwater plants when they are larvae and perch on the tall plants when they are adults try getting eelgrass fanwort hornwort anacharis wild celery corkscrew rush blue flag iris parrot s feather pondweed water lilies and lotus flowers you can find water plants at garden centers and online surround the pond with shrubs place shrubs around the edge of the pond to give the dragonflies more places to land this also makes your pond even more beautiful and appealing the dragonflies will have more places to perch and live you can plant border plants and shrubs for example you can try lobelia seedbox or button bush you can also let the natural grass and brush around the pond grow to give the dragonflies more vegetation spread rocks around your pond rocks in and around your pond will make it even more beautiful dragonflies also love to perch on warm rocks especially flat rocks place rocks in your pond and around the edges to give the dragonflies plenty of places to land you can try a mixture of light and dark rocks the dragonflies may be attracted to one over the other make sure the pond gets plenty of sun dragonflies like sunshine so they will be more attracted to a pond that is out in the open with full sunshine in the middle of the day than one covered by the shade of tree branches 5 x research source place sticks in the middle of your pond while you are waiting for your plants to grow tall enough for dragonflies to perch on place sticks in your pond this gives the dragonflies somewhere to land 6 x research source you can try sticks that you get from nearby trees or bamboo stakes for plants and vegetables avoid placing fish in your pond you may want to put fish in your pond so you can have fish and dragonflies this is not a good idea fish eat dragonfly larvae so the dragonflies will not be attracted to the pond and start breeding there 7 x research source add a fountain to your garden if you don t want to add a pond you can just add a fountain instead these are much more low maintenance you can buy pond pumps at garden or home improvement stores and place them in a tub or trough 8 x research source often you need additional filter boxes for your fountain when it is used outside plant dragonfly attracting flowers in around your home certain flowers will help attract dragonflies to your home you can plant them around the water source in your flower bed or around your home to tempt the dragonflies to visit 9 x research source plant black eyed susans blanket flower cardinal flower goldenrod bee balm catmint coneflower golden alexander phlox russian sage salvia or yarrow,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a bird trap,you cannot legally trap most birds in many states and countries however in a survival situation or to do some basic population control in your yard light trapping is permissible though you may need a permit and you ll certainly find pre made traps more effective you can build your own bird trap with some basic supplies at home or in the wild 1 x research source,use two sticks a cord and a rock to build a basic wilderness bird trap looking somewhat like an upside down l the ojibwa bird pole has been a staple of indigenous hunters in canada for centuries birds perch on a small horizontal branch which you rig to fall under their weight they are then caught in a noose positioned underneath before they can fly away you ll need the pole a large branch roughly the width of a few fingers and 5 6 feet long the perch a pencil thin stick roughly six inches long a rock roughly the size of your fist a 3 4 foot cord or rope shoestrings and sleeping bag chords will work a knife 2 x research source sharpen both ends of the longer pole or stick you drive the bottom side into the ground so it needs to be sharp enough to plant the sharpened top end prevents a bird from landing on the top not your perch drill a hole through the pole at one of the ends it should be as wide as your smaller stick your perch is inserted into this hole as well as the string tie one end of the rope firmly around your rock you just want the rock secured to one end of the string you can use any knot that will keep the rock in place thread the string through the hole and tie a small knot in it the knot should be small enough that the string can still move freely through the post hole the stick will jam in next to the string creating the perch and also holding the string and thus the rock in place the knot should be able to move freely through the hole in the pole when the stick isn t jammed in some trappers tie the small knot first then put the stick in others put the stick in first experiment with what works for you wedge the thinner stick into the hole you drilled next to your knot the perch should be right next to the string though the string should still move freely this perch needs to fall under the weight of the bird in order to snare it so don t jam it in too tightly you should have two feet of string or more on the other side of your knot 3 x research source tie a slip noose knot in the end of the string to make your snare make a noose big enough to fit your fist through if you re unfamiliar with the slip noose knot you can still make one easily with some practice double the string back on itself to make a u shaped loop run the end of the string back towards the top of the loop it will look a bit like a flattened s wrap the end of the rope around the doubled line 2 3 times pull the rope tight cinching the wrap around the doubled string 4 x research source thread the end of the rope through your noose towards the pole you ll be left with a circle of rope draped over your perch the end of the noose will be at the end of the perch and the noose knot itself will be close to the pole you should have two semi circles of rope draped off of the stick tie a simple overhand knot right where the two sticks meet an overhand knot is simply when you create a loop and pull the string through all you have to do is wrap the end around the rope near your hole creating a circle then run the end through that circle this should be right at the point where your two sticks meet 5 x research source check your trap by gently pushing down on the perch as you do the weight of the rock should pull the rope through the hole which will quickly tighten the noose and grab your finger note however that these traps are very variable play with the size of the noose and the perch the closer they are to the same size the more effective your trap will be also try and tie the smallest knot possible in the beginning so that the rope can move freely through the hole you want it to snap shut quickly once the stick is removed place your trap where it is the best place for a bird to land these traps are effective in open fields where it is the best place for the bird to land in the forest most birds will choose tree branches 6 x research source for more effective traps place a little birdseed on the trap adhering it with peanut butter note that small birds only provide minimal calories small birds which are about all this trap can handled only provide about 100 calories apiece unless you have 4 5 successful traps there are much better ways to look for food including insects and game traps for rabbits and squirrels still especially in the winter these traps can be a viable source of nutrition when paired with other survival methods 7 x research source build a backyard trap using a mousetrap a cardboard box and some string this simple trap attaches a cardboard box to a mouse trap spring when the bird lands on the trap the box falls and contains it for later the trap will also spring on squirrels and other small game so it can be an effective trap in a survival scenario as well purchase a live rat or mouse trap the kind with a spring you want the classic trap with a wooden board attached to a spring loaded trap they catch the mouse by flipping a metal bar on them when they touch the bait laden trap you can find these traps at almost any hardware store 8 x research source cut a small hole in the center of a cardboard box use a pen to punch a whole in the middle of the box you want the box to be roughly twice the size of the bird to trap it 9 x trustworthy source the cornell lab of ornithology research lab of cornell university dedicated to interpreting and conserving the earth s biological diversity through research and education about birds go to source fasten the mouse trap to the ground with 2 3 long metal nails you want the trap to be secure enough that it doesn t move when the bird lands on it tie a loop in one end of the thread temporarily loop it around part of the mouse trap thread the other end through the hole in the top of the box later on you ll attach this loop to the spring but for now you just need it looped somewhere on the trap to create tension in the line rest the box on it s edge so that the open part faces the trap it should be angled up so that a bird could fly under the box and land on the trap tie a loop in the end of the thread opposite the mousetrap run a nail through the loop then nail this end of the string into the ground pull the nail out enough to keep the line tight and the box stays balanced on it s edge the inside of the box should be facing the ground with one side raised to allow birds to enter adjust the thread so that the highest edge of the box is only a foot or so in the air the box needs to be high enough the a bird flies into it but low enough that it can shut before the bird can fly out tie the string around the loaded mousetrap spring load the spring but not the arm as if you were setting it for a mouse when you press on the trap it should unload quickly you want the string to be on the mechanism that spring when a mouse or in this case bird steps on it when the bird lands on the trap the box will fall around the bird trapping it the tension of the string is holding the box in place make sure you tie the string so that it sits correctly test the string by pushing on the trap the string should lose tension and box will fall place some bread or birdseed on the mousetrap as bait and wait for a hit do not go near the trap since constant human activity near the trap will scare birds away if you see that the box has fallen go check it to see if you caught anything 10 x research source wear long sleeves and gloves when grabbing a live bird to get the bird out of your trap lift the box slightly reach in and grab the bird firmly around the body wear gloves and long sleeves to prevent any pecking or scratching wounds the darkness should disorient it enough that you can easily pick it off the ground there is always the chance that you ll catch a rabbit or squirrel as well with your trap since it is on the ground be ready for anything,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for a bird,birds are extremely social by nature and thrive on company nurturing and frequent interaction many species of birds make fun engaging pets if you re considering bird ownership the care requirements include providing good housing nutritious food and keeping an eye on the bird s health you ll also need to provide plenty of enrichment and interaction to keep your pet bird happy and alert,purchase a large cage for housing the bird birds thrive in large cages so opt for the largest cage that your housing space can accommodate a general rule of thumb is that the width of the cage should be at least twice the wingspan of your bird for some birds being able to fly short distances within the cage may be an important part of ensuring it has a healthy living space 1 x research source some other fairly standard requirements include the cage bars should not be too small the bird s talons might get caught on or in them if the bar wires or lengths are too small equally the bars should not be so large that the head of the bird could get trapped or the bird could squeeze through and escape the bigger the space in the cage the better although bird cages that are bigger tend to be harder to clean and are more expensive if you are not in the house often or don t have time to take the bird out for exercise space in their cage is critical small cages can lead to behavior problems choose a rectangular cage for your bird circle cages are bad for the bird there is hardly any space for the bird and no corners to feel safe in 2 x research source moreover the circle tends to cause the bird to twist its head the bird can develop behavioral problems from the constant turning and turning do not buy guillotine styled doors since they are easier for the bird to escape from ensure that the space is more than adequate if housing more than one bird never house more than one bird in a small cage birds need space to retreat forage fly and be apart from other birds so the more birds being kept the larger the cage must be aviaries large cages that are akin to small sheds are more appropriate for keeping several birds at the same time if keeping different species of birds you ll need to be sure that the animals are compatible when placed together ensure that placement of the cage is somewhere warm and comfortable cages should be kept indoors and in a room with frequent traffic birds are social animals and will become unhappy if isolated in a room also remember that you ll be cleaning out the cage frequently so hang it somewhere that you can access easily 3 x research source birds in hanging cages can often be transported outdoors to hang under a porch or similar place for daytime fresh air always remember to bring the bird back in before cool evening breezes and night air arrive the location of the bird s cage will also be affected by the bird s personality while a very social bird might love being the center of attention and seeing constant human traffic a more nervous bird might be happier kept somewhere quieter and away from hustle and bustle but still being able to interact with the family nervous birds may do better in the corner of a room or in an area with the back of their cage partially covered avoid placing a cage in front of a window permanently the bird will be on the constant lookout for enemies which can cause it to feel nervous putting a cage against a wall can give the bird a break from worrying about predators place some old magazines papers on the bottom of the cage this makes cleaning much easier and the papers can be disposed of with ease then fresh ones placed straight down for the next day s use 4 x research source keep a supply of papers hand junk mail and old newspapers also work well if you prefer a more traditional method of lining your bird s cage for waste removal line the bottom of the cage with wood chips kitty litter or sand give your bird varied types of food on a daily basis as a rule of thumb a healthy diet for most bird breeds consists of 75 pellets and 25 human table foods since precise dietary requirements are dependent on the species talk with an avian veterinarian to see what type of food your breed of bird needs over time you ll begin to see patterns emerging in the types of food that your bird prefers 5 x research source ensure that you have correct feed for the species of bird you must find the correct food for your bird as some birds are picky while others have very strict dietary requirements usually the bag can of food will have a label telling you which breed of bird it is for if you don t know what the best food choices are ask the breeder the retailer or leave a question on a specialized forum of people who care for this species of bird bird pellets crumbles or nuggets can be a good way of ensuring adequate nutrition for your bird these tend to combine healthy seeds vegetables fruits and grains so the bird can eat a nutritionally balanced diet these are preferable to a seed mix which allows birds to pick out tasty seeds and leave the healthy ones behind feed new seed daily always empty out the eaten shells the same day too as this keeps the seed fresh and clean give your bird fresh fruits and vegetables every day or 2 this adds greens and variety to their diet a mixture or variety of foods is both healthy and fun for birds 6 x research source cut up and serve your bird a variety of fruits and veggies including oranges berries spinach and celery 7 x research source you can also give your bird nuts and cooked beans for flavor and variety with their meals provide constant fresh water there should be a water dish provided fill this daily with average temperature water give your bird water in a large shallow dish since birds can struggle to drink out of deep dishes change water daily to ensure that it is always fresh 8 x research source place the water dish at the opposite end of the bird s cage from the food dish this will force them to move around and be active to eat and drink dehydration can occur very quickly in birds within 1 to 2 days without access to water keep the feeding arrangements sanitary water and food cups should be located up high out of the way of any branches above the birds since birds often drop feces into their food which isn t sanitary if the birds ingest their own fecal matter they could become very ill 9 x research source along with your daily cleaning of the cage be sure to clean out the bird s food and water dishes as well feeding the bird regularly at about the same time each day this could be when you eat or at an arbitrary time like 4 pm however choose a time and try to stick to it so that the bird knows when to expect its food if you want to stick to the natural feeding time of birds feed approximately half an hour after sunrise and just before sunset during the day small fruit and vegetable snacks can be left in the cage smaller birds with a higher metabolism may need to be fed more often make feeding interesting for the bird you can make the eating experience more enjoyable for your bird by making eating time an interactive time too for example encourage your bird to eat a piece of food at a time straight from your hand or encourage your talking bird to sing and talk for its food you can also try interactive puzzle feeders which allow the bird to mimic foraging behaviors it would use in the wild this provides critical mental stimulation for your bird start off with at least 4 toys that are varied and interesting make sure they are bird safe and that toes or beaks cannot get caught in any parts of the toys 10 x research source hanging mirrors and bells make great bird toys be sure that the bell does not have small gaps in it though as this can become caught up in the bird s feet items that are not safe on toys used for birds include frayed ropes could entangle bird feet and beaks wire might impale the bird jingle bell type bells the bird s feet might get stuck in the small cracks give the bird new types of toys to stimulate it change it up a bit birds can get bored with the same toys day in and day out by buying new toys you increase their enjoyment and reduce the chances of feather plucking and other boredom stimulated behaviors birds especially enjoy chewable toys made out of things like pine cones rawhide chews rope or white pine wood 11 x research source set up differently shaped and textured perches for the bird s feet birds will spend the majority of their time perched in their cage so set up a few different perches at different heights set perches on opposite sides of the cage as well so the birds can fly and exercise include some wooden perches and some natural tree branches for variety 12 x research source this helps file the bird s beak and nails so there is less work for you if you get a natural wood perch be sure to scrub thoroughly before use and do not use any cleaning products because many of these contain ingredients that can be toxic to birds place food and enrichment items in multiple places around the cage this will fulfill the bird s need to move about in search of food you can also weave food into the bars of the cage hide food inside a toy or an enrichment device and hang food from the top or sides of the cage all of these will help to satisfy the bird s foraging instinct and is a form of mental stimulation bird proof your living area check the safety of the rooms before allowing the bird to fly and explore the house outside of its cage ensure that the room the bird is contained in is safe this includes closing blinds rolling up cords closing toilet seats ensuring that hot radiators are turned off and checking that open fireplaces are closed off this also goes for simply allowing the bird to fly around in an enclosed space 13 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source most birds need outside of cage time this time must always be supervised and the space must always be safe let your bird explore your house outside of its cage this will give it much more freedom and the bird will enjoy flying around rather than remaining cooped up inside of its cage all day long 14 x research source without this type of socialization birds can end up biting screaming feather plucking and forming phobias hence this is a very important part of keeping the bird happy and well adjusted you can even turn your porch into a screened in aviary and let your bird spend time in the outdoors regularly hold and pet the bird birds crave socialization with humans and will become bored lonely and unhealthy if left in their cage all day 15 x research source the more often you handle the bird the more excited the bird will be to see you and will likely greet you with whistles chirps and bird talk if you regularly handle the bird it will also be easier for you to take it to the vet s office since the bird will be relatively docile to touch ensure that the bird gets daily exercise daily exercise is recommended for all birds that are tame and can be handled safely birds love to interact with their owners and play with toys together if you can release the bird from its cage regularly it will be all the happier for this this is an absolute must if you want to have a healthy relationship with your bird birds can suffer a lot being trapped in cages all of the time considering birds normally fly great distances in their natural environment 16 x research source if you have a finch or other bird that is not meant to be handled this is not an issue but if you have a bird that you wish to handle is living in a small cage or just needs more exercise be sure to include exercise for the bird on a regular basis give the bird lots of attention frequent attention will keep your bird from becoming bored or lonely this will allow you and your bird to become more attached and will result in a happy healthy bird in some cases a good level of attention can reduce shyness in some species of birds as familiarity breeds reassurance 17 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source you can even talk to your bird this is especially important during the first couple of years together birds are fast learners and will surprise you with their range of sound effects play music together for example your bird might learn to sing sweetly when you play the piano or other instrument let the bird ride on your shoulder as long as you ve considered the risks new bird owners often want their small to medium sized birds to stand on their shoulder however if your bird comes to see you as just another perch they may defecate on you or bite your face or ear or swallow your jewelry if you want the bird to sit on your shoulder train it to step off of you and onto your finger as soon as you place your finger next to your shoulder until birds reach sexual maturity it s impossible to gauge their aggressiveness whereas as juvenile bird may sit docilely on your shoulder the bird may start to bite once it s matured do not walk outside with the bird on your shoulder it could fly away and not return find a vet who is qualified to work with birds get your bird checked before you bring it home and then regularly afterwards the vet should inspect your bird at least once a year not all vets are qualified to work with birds or have much experience doing so so be sure to check the vet s credentials 18 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source take your bird to the vet immediately if it gets sick birds can get even sicker very quickly the sooner that the vet can see the bird the better provide water in a large enough container for self cleansing birds are fully capable of handling their own grooming most likely the bird will clean itself in its water bowl provided the bowl is large enough for it to use as a bath 19 x research source also birds bathe to keep cool in warmer weather so be sure to provide water for washing in when the temperature is on the warmer side in hot weather put the bird outside either in its cage or on a perch only have it out of its cage if its wings are clipped so that it can t fly away squirt the bird with water from a spray bottle birds love the cooling sensation if it s cold outside you can buy a perch that mounts to your shower wall by suction cups and give the bird a shower indoors clean the cage on a daily basis a clean cage reduces the changes for bacterial fungal or viral infections from occurring in your bird regular removal of bird droppings is very important for maintaining good bird health 20 x research source a bird living in a clean environment tends to be a more active and happy bird than one living in filth to keep the cage clean change the bedding regularly remove droppings from perches toys remove uneaten food that has been sitting around on the base of the cage if your bird is molting this is common with parrots for example there will be a need to vacuum up the molted feathers daily this tends to occur when there is a warm spell only clean with basic non toxic cleaning supplies birds are easily poisoned so find out if a product is safe for birds before using it only clip a bird s wings if it s necessary in some birds such as parrots this is essential to prevent serious or fatal flight accidents in the indoor or caged environment talk to your veterinarian about this requirement for your bird and find someone qualified to do it should it need doing in most cases a bird s wings will not need to be clipped 21 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source trimming is aimed at restricting not preventing flight and only the primary flight feathers are the subject of a trimming so the trimmer must know what to do the bird s toenails may also need trimming especially on larger adult birds usually toenails are not trimmed on baby or small birds as birds need them to stay on the perches but the toenails of adult parrots for example should be trimmed ask your veterinarian to explain how to do this safely know the signs of a bird that is either too hot or too cold most birds exhibit similar symptoms for being overheated or too cold and you must attend to fixing either situation as quickly as possible or there is a risk of the bird dying generally speaking most pet bird breeds prefer a slightly cool indoor temperature of about 70 f 21 c 22 x research source the things to watch for include 23 x research source an overheated bird the feet will feel hot to touch the bird may be panting a rapid breathing rate fluttering from the throat red nares nasal openings and hot breath all of these signs signal an emergency situation and you must contact the vet immediately a freezing bird the bird will hunch in using its feathers to covers its feet and it will fluff out its feathers check for drafts move the bird away from a cold room or area and place the bird in a warmer spot windows can be a source of cold air during the winter months,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for giant african land snails,giant african land snails are native to east africa but they have adapted to many other countries as they are an invasive species they can grow to 10 inches or 25 centimeters in length in countries where they can be legally kept they can make good pets as they are relatively low maintenance and fascinating to watch if you decide to get a giant african land snail you ll need to house it provide hygiene care and give it regular fresh produce,find an aquarium with a tightly fitting lid while the snail needs ventilation it s also important that the lid of its container fits tightly as it will climb out if given a chance an aquarium works well or really any plastic or glass container that has a tight lid skip wooden containers as the splinters harm the snail for two snails your container will need to be at least 25 5 inches 65 centimeters by 18 inches 45 centimeters by 16 inches 40 centimeters it s fine to keep a snail alone or with a partner however snails are hermaphrodites so if you have more than one in the same container you re likely to end up with baby snails add a substrate the substrate is basically the flooring your snail needs to be content snails like dirt but you need to use peat free compost 1 x research source don t use what you have in your yard as it can contain chemicals that will hurt your snail use 1 to 2 inches of the material about 3 to 6 centimeters since snails like to burrow you should provide a deeper area in the tank where they can dig it s a good idea to put a hideaway spot nearby for the snail s enjoyment moisten the substrate the compost you use needs to be kept moist for the snail to be happy it doesn t need to be soaking wet rather it just needs to be kept damp use a spray bottle to spray it down and keep it damp 2 x research source spray the tank lightly each day to dampen the soil and maintain proper humidity keep your snail warm snails are happiest in temperatures of about 21 degrees celsius 71 degrees fahrenheit to 23 degrees celsius 73 degrees fahrenheit the best way to achieve a warmer temperature if the room isn t warm enough is to place a heating pad under half of the snail s tank you should only place it under half the tank so the snail has somewhere to go to cool down if need be keep track of the temperature in the tank with a thermometer the giant african snail does okay in temperatures from 18 degrees celsius 64 degrees fahrenheit to 29 degrees celsius 84 degrees fahrenheit but not any more extreme than that provide indirect sunlight snails need some light to be happy however indirect sunlight is best full sunlight is too harsh for the snails and they ll stay hidden whenever possible watch for signs of unhappiness if your snail doesn t like the conditions of its house it will likely close itself up in its shell often the snail goes in hiding because the tank is not warm enough if you fix the problem encourage the snail to come back out by giving it a bath in warm water 3 x research source gently place it in a bowl of water wiping it down with a soft cloth wipe down the tank when it looks dirty when you notice the tank starts to look smeared or dirty it s time to wipe it down just use a damp cloth to wipe down the sides and the lid change the substrate weekly the substrate will get dirty over time as your snail uses it for a bathroom that means it needs to be changed out frequently once a week throw out the old substrate and provide the snail with a new clean layer clean the tank fully once a month once in a while you ll need to clean the tank fully clean it at least once a month though some owners clean it weekly take everything out and scrub the tank down thoroughly with hot water you don t want to use cleaners or disinfectants as the snails will absorb those through their skin bathe the snails once a month snails also need regular baths though only about once a month keep in mind that snails absorb through their skin so you don t want to use soap just bathe them in lukewarm water gently wiping them down with a soft cloth 4 x research source wash your hands thoroughly after you do anything with your snail from bathing it to cleaning the cage you need to wash your hands well using warm water and soap scrub them for at least 20 seconds before rinsing 5 x research source though the risk is low snails can act as an intermediate host for certain parasites 6 x research source washing your hands well is important for protecting yourself from possible parasites choose fresh produce giant african land snails will eat almost any vegetarian food but fresh produce is your best option start with foods like lettuce cucumbers apples bananas and cabbage 7 x research source also try corn and bell peppers as well as zucchini grapes melons watercress and spinach always check up on the food and remove it when it s gone bad skip onions pasta starchy foods and anything with salt in it 8 x research source wash your snail s food thoroughly make sure to scrub your snail s food thoroughly before giving it to your snail you want to make sure any pesticides are washed off so that your snail doesn t eat them use a small water dish place a shallow water dish in the snail s container for the snail to drink this dish has the added benefit of providing humidity to the tank be sure to change it out once a day provide calcium to the snail snails need a steady supply of calcium to maintain their shells an easy way to provide it is to place a cuttlefish bone in the tank which can be found at most pet stores use ground eggshells clean or ground oyster shells as an alternative 9 x research source if your snails don t seem to like these you can find calcium you can spray on top of their normal food,Pets-and-Animals
how to start a jellyfish tank,jellyfish are popular pets for ornamental fish tanks their mesmerizing forms and soothing movements make them a living work of art with the right setup you can have exotic jellyfish anywhere in your home even on your desk it does require a lot more thought however than just setting up a standard aquarium as jellyfish are delicate organisms and require a specific tank environment to thrive,look for a small to medium sized aquarium tank you can house your jellyfish in an aquarium tank that is clean and sterile you may decide to have only one to three small jellyfish in a small tank that you can fit on your desk at work or at home or you may go for a medium sized aquarium tank that can fit a larger number of jellyfish look for a tank that is circular in shape or tall and narrow a tank that is circular with a flat base is ideal as the shape can allow your jellyfish to float in the tank water this is essential for the health and happiness of your jellyfish buy a jellyfish tank kit the other option is to buy a tank kit that is made specifically to house jellyfish these tanks come in a small size which is usually circular in shape to house one to three small jellyfish you can also get tall narrow tanks for a larger number of jellyfish you can purchase jellyfish tank kits online or at your local pet store 1 x research source keep in mind jellyfish tank kits are not cheap ranging from 350 600 you may want to try using an aquarium tank instead to save money on your set up 2 x research source get the other necessary supplies most jellyfish tank kits come with the supplies necessary for setting up the tank if you are using a fish aquarium to house your jellyfish you will need to purchase several other supplies including an air pump an undergravel filter plate an air tube airline tubing substrate for the bottom of the tank such as glass beads an led light an led remote control optional find a flat raised spot that does not get direct sunlight jellyfish do well in dark environments make sure you place the tank on a flat raised spot in your home or office that does not get direct sunlight and is not near any heat sources or electrical equipment 3 x research source a low table in your home in a dark spot or the top of a desk would work you could also get a small raised wooden stand for your home or office and place the tank on top of that set up the filter plate and air tube connect the filter plates together and place the air tube in the center of the filter plates depending on which filter plates you buy they may come in several small parts or one to two larger parts you want the air tube to be in the middle of the tank so it can circulate air throughout the tank you may need to trim off one side of one of the plates to make it fit with the rest of the plates you can do this using scissors or an x acto knife place the filter plate and the air tube in the tank the plates should cover the bottom of the tank and fit snugly when you slide it into the tank put in the substrate substrate is going to help to hide the filter plates in the tank you should use glass beads rather than sand or gravel gravel can be a hazard for your jellyfish place the beads into the tank by hand so they do not break or nick the tank look for glass beads at your local dollar store or online glass beads that are the size of jelly beans are ideal substrate for your tank you should fill the tank with at least one layer of substrate or 2 inches of glass beads for a medium sized tank connect the air tube to the air pump once the substrate is in the tank you can connect the air tube to the air pump do this by using the airline tubing place the airline tubing into the air tube so it is dangling a few inches into the tube then connect the airline tubing to the air pump this will allow you to cycle through air into the tank using the air pump add salt water to the tank jellyfish are salt water animals so you will need to use salt water only in the tank you can make your own salt water using marine salt or buy pre mixed salt water at your local pet store do not use sea salt or salt for consumption 4 x research source to make salt water for your tank you can use aquarium salt or ionic salt you should dissolve the salt crystals in reverse osmosis filtered water or distilled water making sure there are no big chunks of salt in the water do not use tap water as it contains elements that could be harmful for your jellyfish once you add the salt water smooth over the glass beads with your hand so they are even at the bottom of the tank plug in the air pump and the led light once you do this you should let the tank run for at least 12 hours during this time the water should turn from cloudy to clear 5 x research source some jellyfish tank owners will add in the jellyfish to the tank right away and then do daily water changes the water changes help to control the ammonia levels down in the tank however letting the tank cycle through before adding the jellyfish will ensure your new pets stay healthy in their tank test the ammonia nitrite and nitrate levels you can get test kits for aquariums that will allow you to test the tank water for these elements you should do this once the tank water has cycled through and appears clear in the tank the test should show a built up of ammonia followed by a rise in nitrite as the ammonia level goes down nitrate will then start to appear as the nitrite level falls 6 x research source ideally you should have ammonia and nitrate at 0 0ppm in the tank you may have lower nitrate levels at around 20ppm once these substances are at these levels you are clear to add jellyfish into your tank buy jellyfish from a reliable pet supply store you should search for online pet supply stores that specialize in jellyfish and offer a money back guarantee most jellyfish supply stores offer moon jellyfish or blue blubber jellyfish though you can find other varieties for your tank the jellyfish will be shipped to you alive in plastic bags 7 x research source alternatively you can buy jellyfish in person at a pet supply store talk to a sales associate to ensure they are knowledgeable about the jellyfish they are selling you want to buy jellyfish that are floating and moving in a tank already with bright healthy looking tentacles often pet supply stores will have a specialty area for jellyfish and other sea animals a species of jellyfish called moon jellyfish do best in home aquariums moon jellyfish are seasonal animals and usually live between 6 to 12 months 8 x research source look for jellyfish that are around the same diameter and size your jellyfish tank is a closed system so you do not want to crowd the tank with too many jellyfish or jellyfish that are various sizes the larger jellyfish will end up outgrowing the smaller jellies and over power them the smaller jellies will then shrink in size and not fare as well as the bigger jellies 9 x research source you should also only buy one species of jellyfish for your tank for example you may decide to have only moon jellyfish in your tank or only blue blubber jellyfish in your tank most jellyfish species do better with the same species in one tank 10 x research source acclimate your jellyfish to your tank slowly your jellyfish will come in clear plastic bags you should start by making sure the tank has been cycled completely and has healthy nitrate levels you will then need about twenty minutes per bag of jellyfish to acclimate your new pets to their tank 11 x research source place the sealed bag of jellies on the surface of your tank for 10 minutes this will help bring the water in the bag to the same temperature as the tank water after 10 minutes open the bag and remove half of the water with a clean cup then add tank water to the bag making sure the amount of tank water is equal to the bag water you removed after another 10 minutes you can slowly release your jelly into your tank use an aquarium net to gently release them do not pour them out into the tank as this can shock them check that your jellyfish are pulsing and moving in the tank it may take your jellyfish a few hours to acclimate to their new home once they are comfortable they will pulse and move in the tank usually about three to four times every minute 12 x research source you should observe your jellyfish over the next few days to ensure they appear to be moving and pulsing comfortably in your tank if your jellyfish appears to have turned inside a process known as eversion your water temperature may be off jellyfish should be kept in water temperatures of 24 degrees celsius to 28 degrees celsius you may need to adjust your water temperature and test your water again to ensure it has the proper ammonia nitrite and nitrate levels 13 x research source feed the jellyfish live or frozen baby brine shrimp twice a day you can get live or frozen baby brine shrimp at your local pet store or online you should feed your jellies twice a day once in the morning and once at night 14 x research source live shrimp brine will keep in the refrigerator for up to two weeks you can feed the jellyfish through a small opening in the tank to prevent getting stung by their tentacles the jellyfish should catch and ingest the food on their own do not overfeed your jellies as this could compromise the water quality in the tank if you have smaller and bigger jellyfish in the tank you may not be able to encourage the smaller ones to grow and stay healthy by overfeeding them anyway do a weekly 10 water change to maintain healthy water quality in your tank you should do a 10 water change once a week this means that you will change out 10 of the water and replace it with new salt water 15 x research source remember to test the water quality after each water change the salinity level should be 34 55 ppt which is closest to natural seawater you should also confirm the ammonia nitrite and nitrate levels are correct in the tank remove jellyfish that become too big for the tank with the right care your jellyfish should grow to a healthy size you can prevent overcrowding by only having a few jellyfish in your tank at a time if your jellyfish appear to outgrow your tank or if you feel your tank is overcrowded you may need to remove one of your jellyfish to do this do not release the jellyfish into the wild via the ocean or a body of water it is illegal to do this and puts the jellyfish s life at risk 16 x research source instead you should contact the seller you bought the jellyfish from to then arrange for a new home or caretaker for the jellyfish,Pets-and-Animals
how to become a wildlife rehabilitator,wild animals that are hurt or sick need care just like any other animal some veterinarians specialize in this kind of work but the main group of people responsible for healing wild animals are wildlife rehabilitators becoming a wildlife rehabilitator can take a long time you will need to be properly trained and licensed to work with wild animals but can be a very rewarding career,get vaccinated be prepared because the rehabilitation center will ask you to get certain vaccinations and provide the paperwork for them a rabies vaccine is a must find a center where you can volunteer search for centers in your area at http www owra org find a wildlife rehabilitator if you can t locate any on that site call your state game and wildlife commission for a list of rehabilitators in your state the busy season for wildlife centers starts in the spring this is when baby animals are born and the boom continues through the summer most places have limited acceptance periods so they can have a trained staff on hand for spring think about volunteering at a couple different places to see which kinds of animals you d like to work with 1 x research source volunteer at a wildlife rehabilitation center your experience might include doing office work helping to fundraise or assisting with some of the animal care at first you will not be doing much with animals but you might be helping to prepare food or ready or clean cages or bedding as you get more experience you might be able to do more hands on work with the animals you will need to meet these basic criteria before beginning be 18 or older fill out a volunteer form for the center have enough time to do a shift per week minimum usually 4 hours participate in annual trainings be willing and able to transport injured animals do an informational interview with a wildlife rehabilitator you might think that you want to train to be a wildlife rehabilitator but it might be different than you imagine ask a wildlife rehabilitator if you can interview him or her to get a sense of what they actually do every day some sample questions might be what does a typical day look like how did you get into wildlife rehabilitation what is the most difficult part of your job what kinds of suggestions do you have for me decide where you want to work eventually do you want to try and get a job at one of the centers where you have volunteered talk to them to see if they are planning to hire any time soon are you planning to do a broad search you can search internationally here do you want to start your own rehabilitation center how will you do that if you want your own center where will you get the money to purchase and build the facility make sure you are prepared for what your job prospects might be get a college degree in biology or ecology even though for some positions a college degree is not required it is for most a major in a biology related field including coursework on mammalogy ornithology animal behavior and ecology would be the best preparation for becoming a wildlife rehabilitator these courses would give you a background in the way animals function and their environment 2 x research source approach the head of your facility for an apprenticeship or internship this is a year or more in which your hours are carefully documented and cataloged followed by a test most states will require this time period before you are able to be licensed check with your state s game and wildlife department they will have a list of the requirements for becoming a wildlife rehabilitator it s common for the list to include specialized training regarding the animals you want to work with exams to demonstrate proficiency and possibly participation in a mentorship program 3 x research source get your license most states require wildlife rehabilitators to have a license issued by the game and wildlife department make sure you have all of the qualifications before you apply for the license some of the requirements may include 4 x research source veterinarian training or a period of apprenticeship working in a wildlife rehabilitation center passing a wildlife rehabilitation exam for the species you will deal with completed application find a job keep in mind it might take a while and it might not be full time you can search one database here for possibilities http www nwrawildlife org networking hopefully you ve been able to network and meet enough people during the time you were volunteering and training that you have a group of people in the field that know you keep up with these people as you look for a job if you want to work at one particular location keep in contact with them until they have an opening and always let them know that you are ready to help at any time work hard rehabilitating wildlife most wildlife rehabilitators work closely with a veterinarian to care for wild animals in their care as a wildlife rehabilitator each day is likely to be different as you care for a variety of hurt and sick animals you will be caring for traumatized or wounded animals new babies whose parents cannot care for them animals who are disabled in some way all of whom are wild and undomesticated each case will require strong knowledge of animal behavior and biology as well as a medical expertise to make a diagnosis and create a treatment plan 5 x research source keep up with the field stay in touch with the other people in your network involved in wildlife rehabilitation take courses to stay current in your licensing read about the latest innovations and discoveries think about whether you want to stay in your current position or if you want to change in the future perhaps to open your own center once

how to make a sock monkey,this classic goofy sock toy has been a favorite of children and adults for many decades 1 x research source although there are a number of steps to making this popular toy it is surprisingly easy and can be done by anyone with basic sewing skills each sock is cut to form different parts of the monkey s body and with careful following of each step you ll see your own unique sock monkey appear before your eyes in no time,find two clean socks the best ones will be ones with heels and toes in contrasting colors to the rest of the sock one sock will be used to make the body legs and head and the other will used to make the arms tail face and ears 2 x research source sock monkeys were traditionally made with rockford red heel socks which had a distinctive red heel on each sock 3 x research source if you have striped socks those work well too if your socks have cuffs a turned over and stitched section at the top of the socks be sure to undo the seam carefully the extra length created from undoing the cuff is needed for the length of the monkey avoid using socks that are threadbare or past their best this toy will look smarter and last longer if the socks are still in good condition and unstained turn both socks inside out lay one sock with the heel flat down you may have to flatten the sock against its natural crease to make this happen if it s not cooperating grab an iron and give it a quick once over draw a center line on the sock from the toe to approximately one inch 2 5cm from the colored heel this will become the split in the monkey s legs again note that the heel is actually hidden beneath the sock at this point so you may have to flip it over briefly to double check your positioning erasable fabric marker works best for drawing make sure before you cut that your line is indeed on the halfway mark a monkey with one fat leg and one skinny leg is not a happy monkey with the sock still folded flat sew up one side of your marked line and back down the other leave approximately 1 4 inch 0 6 cm between the line and each of your seams you can either use a sewing machine or sew by hand if you re using a sewing machine use your walking foot cut along the line between your two seams the monkey s legs and colored feet will now be clearly visible 4 x research source turn the sock right side out and stuff the entire thing polyfill stuffing is available at all craft supply stores the upper half of the sock will become the torso and head important when stuffing the sock monkey use small pieces of stuffing using bigger pieces may be quicker but the results aren t satisfying at all the project will come out lumpy and ugly smaller pieces leave a smooth finish it may help to use the eraser end of a pencil to gently push stuffing into place the amount of stuffing is up to you how firm do you want your monkey if the sock is thin you may want to err on the side of under stuffing as overstuffing it may cause it to stretch too much sew the head if your sock opening is the same color as the body of the sock just make a nice rounded head and stitch it shut if it is a contrasting color you will need to decide if you want to cut it off making a shorter body for the monkey and make the head as usual or use the excess coloring as a hat by not stuffing the last inch or two and cinching the opening into a cone shape to make the head stitch around the neck with quarter inch 0 6cm stitches use sturdy thread such as embroidery floss 5 x research source pull the stitches snugly until you get the size neck you want and knot the ends round out the head area with stuffing as desired and stitch the top opening shut if you are making a hat start working with the cuff gather the tip with large stitches and snug cinch them closed fold the raw edges to the center and tuck inside then stitch the opening closed winter ready cut the second sock into sections as shown though the pattern is only drawn on the top make sure to cut through both layers of the sock fold both arm pieces in half lengthwise then sew up the open side in a gentle arc around the dark ends cuff band the dark ends will become the paws and the opposites open ends are where the arm will be stuffed and then attached to the body keep all of these sections open ended make sure they re turned inside out as you work if they re not all your seams will be very rough fold the tailpiece in half lengthwise then sew up the open side and in a gentle arc around the dark end toe end as you did with the arms the dark end will become the tip of the tail and the opposite open end is where the tail will be stuffed and attached to the body fold each ear in half and cut across the crease then sew in a gentle arc following the rounded sides leaving the flat side open the opening is where you will stuff each ear and then attach it to the body noticing a pattern if you d like you can then fold the ears again forming a vertical line down the middle of the ear giving it depth like a real ear has basically pinch the edge you just sewed in and bring the two points together slip stitch the two sides together 6 x research source for now do nothing with the muzzle formerly the heel that part s saved for later flip the sewn pieces right side out and stuff them you should now have two arms two ears a tail and an unsewn unstuffed nose the tail may prove to be a bit of a problem you could try to stuff it using regular polyfill stuffing and a pencil to poke it through or you could use batting or part of an aquarium filter both the batting and the filter are a bit firmer and will create a more uniform looking tail in the long run 6 x research source attach the tail to the rump position it carefully and slip stitch it all the way around attach the arms to either side of the body you may want to position them a little higher than your natural inclination suggests this will give your sock a more monkey like posture trim away the edges of the heel piece if necessary since this will form the muzzle try to make sure the piece of fabric is uniform in color note that since the outermost edges will be covered you do not have to make them perfect fold the bottom of the muzzle under and sew it to the bottom of the monkey s chin make sure no raw edges are visible along the bottom but leave the top open for now add stuffing to make the muzzle puff out you may want to refer to existing images of sock monkeys to help you understand how this should look the best sock monkeys seem to have a muzzle that puffs out at nearly a 90º angle fold the raw edge under and stitch the top edge to the face the muzzle should take up a large amount of the area for the head don t worry about needing space for the rest of its features go ahead give your monkey a mouth along the toe line of the muzzle which should be dead center branch stitch stem stitch in a contrasting color of thread 6 x research source if you d like nostrils simply embroider two small rectangles above the mouth about 1 2 5 cm apart fold the raw edges of each ear to the inside and stitch them closed stitch the completed ears to the sides of the head they should be in line with where the eyes will be just above the muzzle make sure they stick out from the front add button eyes to give your monkey whites on the outside of his eyes glue or sew the buttons onto a bit of white felt then with thread of a contrasting color sew on the felt just above the muzzle you now have an adorable sock monkey for a normal looking monkey stick to black buttons the size of buttons you need depends on the size of your monkey and if you re giving it to a child either avoid the buttons entirely or make sure they re sewn on really well,Pets-and-Animals
how to take care of your fish,fish make both beautiful and entertaining pets whether you are a beginner or an expert there are a few basics of fish ownership that are important to follow ensure that they are comfortable and healthy by getting the right size tank and adding appropriate plants and decorations fish can live a long time so establishing a cleaning and feeding routine will make ownership more fun and less stressful,in the first step to the cycle your fish poops the waste contains a toxic chemical called ammonia ammonia is also produced by leftover food in the tank so be sure you re not overfeeding your fish when you test your ammonia in the tank an ideal level is below 0 25ppm beneficial bacteria called nitrosomonas bacteria digests the ammonia and turns it into nitrites this bacteria is found in your fish filter before you get your fish run your filter for awhile in the tank and add in fish food to feed the bacteria when a brown film appears in the filter media do not wash the filter this brown film is the nitrosomonas bacteria without it your fish will suffer ammonia poisoning nitrites are toxic to your fish when you test them the ideal level is 0 0ppm beneficial bacteria nitrobacter bacteria digests the nitrites and turns it into nitrates as well as the nitrosomonas bacteria this bacteria is also visible in a brown film in the filter nitrates should be kept below 20ppm plants assist in removing nitrates but you should do at least a one fourth water change every week to keep the nitrates down the cycle starts again when you put fish food in the tank you should only get your fish when your tank is fully cycled meaning the ammonia and nitrites are 0ppm and the nitrates are below 20ppm when you add your fish only add up to three at a time or your ammonia will rise decide on freshwater or saltwater freshwater fish are the best choice for beginners as they require less aquarium maintenance they also generally have fewer health issues in home aquariums saltwater fish require saltwater aquariums and are more challenging to maintain however they are quite beautiful 1 x research source go with a small breed in many cases small fish are peaceful breeds they also require less tank space making them a good choice for first time fish owners neon tetras zebra danios and livebearers are all solid options be aware that some fish thought to be able to keep in bowls like goldfish can actually grow quite large ideally the smallest fish tank you can keep is 3 gallons 2 x research source if you go with a fish species that prefer to live in schools or shoals like tetras plan to purchase at least five of them at once schooling fish swim together whereas shoaling fish only swim together when afraid both fish need companions to feel safe select companion fish carefully when deciding which fish to put in your tank you ll need to go beyond color and appearance and focus on behaviors instead you generally need to either put non aggressive or aggressive fish together if you mix the types then the aggressive fish will usually attack the others 3 x research source for example goldfish guppies and tiger pleco are all friendly fish that will coexist peacefully together angelfish and cichlids are two types of aggressive fish that can often live in a tank together without harming one another buy from a reputable dealer or store if you purchase from a pet store you have the added security of seeing the actual fish that you are buying most stores also often a refund if the fish dies prior to a certain date if you buy online you ll forgo any choice regarding the individual fish but you will gain more fish breeds to choose from 4 x research source if you do go the online route choose a dealer that offers clear customer service connections via email or the phone look for positive reviews online as well these can often be found in fish owner forums avoid wild caught whenever possible wild caught fish are often more sensitive caught in inhumane ways and harder to care for as soon as you receive a fish from online or before buying it in the store look to make sure that it appears healthy it should be active and swimming around at a steady pace the eyes and gills should be clear of debris or mucus the scales should be intact and scratch free 5 x research source get the right size tank the bigger that your fish will get or the more of them that you have the larger your tank will need to be as a general rule a freshwater fish that grows to be one inch length should have 4 5 liters 1 2 us gal of water in the tank a saltwater fish measuring the same size should have 2 5 liters 0 7 us gal of water multiply these figures by the total number of fish that you have to decide which tank to purchase 6 x research source however this rule doesn t always apply some energetic species such as shrimp require more room to thrive you also need to consider the bio load of the fish how much ammonia they produce higher bio loads need bigger tanks for example plecos goldfish and platies have high bio loads while tetras and otocinclus have lower bio loads when in doubt it s better to get a slightly larger tank as overcrowding can cause a number of health problems for fish it can even lead to fish deaths due to poor water quality make sure to base your calculations on your fish s full adult size not their current size place your tank in a good location fish tanks can be quite heavy so invest in a quality stand and once you get it into position try not to move it around too often make sure to place your tank out of direct sunlight to avoid algae growth it should also be on level ground to minimize the possibility of it tipping over a quieter room without a tv or lots of foot traffic generally makes for a more peaceful environment for your fish it s also a good idea to not smoke in the same room as your fish as this damages the air quality if you have other pets or if your fish jump remember to get a lid for your tank install your heater most fish require that the water in your tank maintains a specific temperature usually between 72 and 84 degrees fahrenheit however some fish like goldfish are cold water fish and need lower temperatures to keep the temperature regulated and steady you ll use a heater in your tank some heaters go under the gravel or other substrate others hang on the side of the tank follow the installation directions on the package 7 x research source it s important to place your tank near a functioning electrical socket as you ll need to plug in devices like your heater light and filter install the filtration system a filter will keep your water clean and remove many pollutants such as fecal matter there are mechanical filters that catch debris in traps that can be emptied there are chemical filters that absorb pollutants with activated carbon and there are biological filters that use active bacteria to balance the chemicals in the water 8 x research source a mechanical filter is generally the best option for a beginner as they are fairly basic some filters should be placed under the gravel in your tank whereas others hang from the back of your tank 9 x research source there are also canister filters which go inside the tank only clean the first filter media near the back of the filter it only needs cleaning if it s full of debris otherwise do not clean the filter this will cause ammonia and nitrite spikes and could kill your fish the filter media will grow beneficial brown bacteria on it which removes toxic chemicals from the fish waste it is essential to keeping your fish alive add in your substrate a good rule of thumb is that you ll need one pound of sand rock or gravel per one gallon of water in your tank before placing your substrate in your tank rinse it off thoroughly with tap water to remove any dust then place the substrate gently in your tank with just a slight slope towards the front 10 x research source select and place any decorations in the tank choose decorations that provide safe hiding places for your fish but also look natural such as driftwood or rock structures it s best to stick with only one large piece initially to avoid overcrowding your tank rinse off any objects with tap water prior to placing them in the tank 11 x research source driftwood will need to be boiled for 30 minutes and soaked for a week before placing in a tank try to balance out your decorations by placing taller or larger pieces towards the back of the tank this will also make it easier to view your fish in action make sure that your decorations don t have sharp edges plastic pieces that can break off or paint that might flake 12 x research source select and place any plants in the tank many people opt for plastic plants as they are easy to clean and come in a wide variety of vibrant colors however live plants have the benefit of increasing the oxygen levels in your tank removing nitrates in the water and also creating a more natural look rinse off your plastic or natural plants in tap water before placing them in the tank make sure that they are partially secured at the base by some substrate to prevent lots of movement 13 x research source if you decide to add live plants then you ll want to consider their light needs most live plants will need at least 10 hours light a day amazon sword java grass water wisteria hornwort and java fern are a few examples of hardy live plants that are great for starter aquariums condition the water and fill up your tank set aside enough water in buckets to fill up your tank treat the water with a de chlorinating agent and wait until it takes full effect the directions should be listed on the package when the water is ready gently pour it into the tank 14 x research source once the water is in your tank put some fish food in and wait until brown beneficial bacteria is growing on the filter media test your water qualities once the ammonia and nitrites are 0ppm and the nitrates are below 20ppm you can acclimate the fish the tank usually will take six weeks to cycle but the process can be sped up by adding beneficial bacteria or used filter media float any new fish once you bring your new fish home set the bag with them inside it in your tank for 10 15 minutes add ¼ cup of tank water into the bag and then reclose it and let it continue to float for another five minutes then gently tip the bag into the water and watch as your fish swim away 15 x research source some fish such as otocinclus require drip acclimation to do this tie a knot in air tubing and start a siphon by putting one end in the tank and sucking on the other end place the end you were sucking on into the bag with the fish the water should slowly drip into the bag drip acclimate for about 30 minutes don t skip this step as it helps to acclimate your fish to the new water qualities and temperature it reduces the risk of shock don t overfeed feeding your fish twice a day with the serving size the size of their eye is usually sufficient talk with your vet or the pet store about how much you should aim to feed per fish but you can also adjust the amounts that you give based on how much is left over ideally no food will remain in the tank after half an hour 16 x research source excess food can cause all sorts of problems including clogging filters ammonia and nitrite spikes and contributing to algae growth feeding the right type of food is important as well most fish to well with flakes or freeze dried food but some bottom feeders will require sinking pellets test the ph levels weekly get a water testing kit and follow the directions to collect and measure the ph present in your tank make sure that your water falls within an acceptable range for freshwater fish this is usually between 6 6 and 8 if your ph is too low add crushed coral to the filter if it s too high add peat moss to the filter or driftwood to the tank these will tint the water slightly yellow but it is completely safe for your fish do weekly partial water changes for freshwater tanks you ll need to change about 20 30 of the water saltwater tanks generally need to be cleaned more use a suction wand to remove the water and pull out the debris from the substrate at the same time then replace the removed water with fresh treated water kept in additional buckets nearby 17 x research source clean your filter media if the filter is close to overflowing your tank filter can become clogged with debris if left too long in the water for most filters you ll need to pull them out completely and replace with new ones however in some cases it s possible to simply rinse the first filter media off with old tank water check your filter s directions remember to only clean the first filter media the one closest to the back if you clean all of it your ammonia and nitrite levels will rise because you removed all the beneficial bacteria treat any health problems watch your fish to ensure that they are swimming actively and maintaining a healthy coloring they should be breathing freely and not gasping take a close look at their scales as well to ensure that no spotting or flaking is occurring if you notice that one of your fish looks ill scoop it out and isolate it in a separate tank for monitoring 18 x research source add needed medications make sure to remove any dead fish from the tank immediately most medications should never be added as a preventative measure,Pets-and-Animals
how to take care of ghost shrimp,ghost shrimp are interesting low maintenance aquatic pets also known as glass shrimp translucency is their most recognizable trait they re fairly hardy and you ll just need to ensure the water s temperature chemical ph and oxygen levels are within healthy ranges while they only live about a year they tend to breed rapidly so you establishing a long term colony is super easy,keep your shrimp in a 5 to 10 gallon 19 to 38 l aquarium choose a tank no smaller than 5 gallons 19 l for your pets a larger tank is preferable if you re raising a large number of shrimp as a rule of thumb the tank should hold 1 gallon 3 8 l of water for every 10 ghost shrimp it houses 1 x research source shop for tanks for aquatic pets online or at a pet store go with a tank that has a secure lid believe it or not ghost shrimp can jump out of the water and escape if you have an existing aquarium and want to add shrimp to it keep in mind shrimp don t do well with most fish species unless you re raising the shrimp to feed your fish keep them in a tank with other shrimp snails and docile fish such as cory catfish install a sponge filter or use a filter with a covered intake even though ghost shrimp do much of the cleaning themselves a filter is necessary for a healthy aquarium for a smaller tank use an internal sponge filter which doesn t generate a strong flow or pose the risk of sucking up shrimp for a larger tank go with an external aquarium filter with a sponge cover over the intake that way shrimp won t accidentally get sucked into the filter if you go with an external filter for a larger tank choose one that changes 3 to 5 times the amount of water in your tank per hour if you re not sure which product to buy head to the pet store and ask an employee for recommendations 2 x research source use an air pump to add oxygen to the water even if you re using an external tank filter it s best to install an additional air pump which you can find online and at pet stores ghost shrimp need high oxygen levels in order to breed and shed their exoskeletons keeping live plants in the tank can also help oxygenate the water line the tank with 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm of gravel and sand purchase chemical and dye free aquarium gravel and sand at a pet store before adding it to the tank place the sand and gravel in a fine sieve and rinse thoroughly it under running water add coarser gravel to the bottom of the tank then cover it with finer gravel or sand 3 x research source ghost shrimp are sensitive to chemicals dust and debris so be sure to rinse away any impurities before lining the tank add the gravel to the tank gently to avoid damaging the glass add aquatic plants and hiding spots live plants will add oxygen to the water promote healthy bacteria growth and add aesthetic appeal to your aquarium purchase aquatic plants at the pet store don t use wild specimens and ask a store employee for help choosing species that are safe for shrimp you could also put a cave or other decorative hiding spots in your aquarium in addition to leafy aquatic plants consider adding moss to the tank moss is low maintenance and will provide food for your shrimp place a heater in the tank to keep the temperature around 75 f 24 c ghost shrimp can tolerate water temperatures between 65 and 85 f 18 and 29 c but they do best in water that s around 75 f 24 c to maintain this temperature purchase an aquarium heater and monitor the tank s temperature with a thermometer 4 x research source look online or at your local pet store for an aquarium heater and thermometer the right heater depends on the size of your tank a 50 watt heater should do the trick for a 10 gallon 38 l tank for other sizes use this calculator to determine the wattage your heater needs https aquariuminfo org volumecalculator html cycle the tank for 2 to 8 weeks before adding the shrimp fill the tank with warm tap water then add a few flakes of fish food or store bought ammonia labeled for fishless cycling using aquarium water test strips check the ammonia level in the tank after 3 to 4 days look for an ammonia level between 2 and 4 ppm parts per million 5 x research source then after 1 to 2 weeks test for nitrites look for nitrite levels to spike then drop after a few days to 0 ppm when nitrite levels drop nitrate levels should increase after 2 to 8 weeks ammonia and nitrite levels should stabilize at 0 ppm and nitrate levels should be under 2 ppm cycling the tank encourages healthy bacteria to grow these bacteria consume ammonia and nitrite which are toxic to ghost shrimp and other aquatic pets place the shrimp and the water from the pet store bag in a bowl when you re ready to introduce the shrimp to their new home open the travel bag or container provided by the pet store carefully pour the shrimp and the water from the bag into a fishbowl or bucket 6 x research source after adding the shrimp and water to the bowl it should only be about half full there needs to be enough room to add more water so choose a large enough bowl siphon water from the tank into the bowl place the bowl with the shrimp next to the tank dip a flexible tube into the tank and twist a rubber band tightly around the other end lower the end with the rubber band over the bowl with the shrimp and allow water to slowly drip into the bowl 7 x research source gravity will siphon water through the tube from the tank into the bowl monitor the water flow and if necessary tighten the rubber band to slow the drip allow water to drip into the bowl for about 30 minutes to slowly acclimate the shrimp to their new water s chemistry transfer the shrimp to the tank with a soft mesh net after acclimating the shrimp for 30 minutes gently scoop up a few of them with a soft mesh net carefully release the shrimp into the tank and repeat the steps until you ve transferred all them from the bowl to the tank 8 x research source don t just dump the water from the bowl into your tank especially if you re adding the shrimp to an existing aquarium water from the pet store may contain parasites and bacteria that could contaminate your tank offer store bought pellets or small bits of boiled vegetables ghost shrimp are not picky eaters look for store bought shrimp pellets online and at pet stores additionally you can feed your pets small amounts of boiled vegetables such as zucchini or spinach 9 x research source ghost shrimp will also munch on waste algae and other matter in the tank feed your ghost shrimp a small amount of food twice a day you only need to feed your shrimp a tiny amount of food at a time about 1 to 2 pea sized amounts of vegetable matter or store bought shrimp pellets can sustain 5 or 6 adult shrimp for a day 10 x research source if you feed your shrimp store bought pellets check the instructions for the recommended amount to feed your pets watch your shrimp as they eat since their bodies are translucent you ll be able to see food make its way through their digestive systems change 30 of the water once a week use a flexible tube or vacuum siphon to remove about 30 of the tank s water be sure not to suck up any of your shrimp with the siphon then add an equal amount of clean tap water to the tank 11 x research source make sure the water temperature is around 75 f 24 c if you re only keeping shrimp in the tank you shouldn t need to do much more maintenance than water changes however if there are larger fish in the tank periodically remove waste with a siphon vacuum or brush test your tap water before adding it to the tank it should be free of heavy metals and chlorine and ammonia and nitrite levels should be 0 ppm if necessary treat your water with a dechlorinator which you can buy at the pet store or use bottled or filtered water choose other shrimp species snails or small docile fish for tank mates ghost shrimp live well with other species of freshwater shrimp and non aggressive aquatic animals such as snails in general most fish that are larger than ghost shrimp aren t suitable tank mates small docile species such as cory or otocinclus catfish may get along with your shrimp 12 x research source unless you re using your shrimp as food fish species you should definitely avoid include oscars arowanas cichlids angelfish discus and triggerfish if you want to add shrimp to your existing aquarium and don t care if some get eaten add at least 20 to the tank the shrimp will be more resilient if their numbers are stronger if you re using the shrimp as food it s wise to establish a colony in a separate tank to replenish the population in the main aquarium 13 x research source test the water s ph and chemical levels monthly find aquarium water test kits at the pet store and keep a supply on hand every 3 to 4 weeks test your tank s water to ensure the ph ammonia nitrite and nitrate are within ideal ranges the water s ph or acidity level should be neutral if the ph isn t between 6 0 and 8 5 purchase an aquarium tank amendment at the pet store treat the water according to your product s instructions if the ammonia or nitrite levels are over 0 ppm do a 30 water change remove any visible waste and consider applying ammonia neutralizing drops to the water if you have a friend who owns a healthy aquarium you could also add gravel from their tank to yours to introduce beneficial bacteria,Pets-and-Animals
how to breed red cherry shrimp,this article will teach you how to breed the easiest of the freshwater shrimp red cherry shrimp neocaridina denticulata sinensis red cherry shrimp or rcs are in a group called dwarf shrimp the adults can reach up to 1 5 inches 4cm in length rcs need no special tanks foods dances or shamans to breed tank conditions are easy to set up they are a fun addition to an aquarium and eat uneaten fish food,set up your tank you will need a 5 to 10 gallon or 20 to 40 litre tank a heater to keep temperature at 75f 80f or 24 27c during cool nights gravel dark will stress the shrimps less and a bubble filter that is cycled to cycle a bubble filter in a new tank put the new bubble filter in an old tank turn it on and wait for 4 weeks rcs will not survive the cycling process and will die from high levels of ammonia or nitrites do not use a power filter unless the whole intake is covered with pantyhose or something with similar very small holes and secured with a zip tie otherwise shrimp may get sucked into the filter and pureed buy a master test kit this is absolutely required for keeping shrimp it is impossible to determine the problem with a tank without a master test kit you will need the following tests ammonia nitrite nitrate get drop tests not test strips test strips are expensive and expire after about 6 months of being open drop kits are much cheaper per test and last longer purchase 5 10 red cherry shrimp rcs cost 1 50 3 us each at a pet store they cost much less per shrimp via online on websites and forums many people also offer free shipping like 20 or so for 20 or so shrimp it is easy to get a good deal these days try to get a mix of clear males can have some red as well males and red females if you get 10 shrimp your chance of getting both males and females is pretty much guaranteed 1 x research source if someone wants to ship with a method that takes longer than 3 days ask for pictures about how the shrimp are packaged cherry shrimp are very hard to kill and will most likely have no problem with a week in transit take into consideration the weather over the distance it will be shipped ask for heat packs or ice packs in the shipping container to help counter ambient temperatures if that is a potential problem also request breather bags do not buy rcs or any fish or shrimp that the pet store received in the last 3 or 4 days any deaths from the stress of shipping tend to occur during the 3 4 days after putting them in the store tanks so buy after this period buy only shrimp that have been in the store tanks at least 4 days it is normal and desirable for the shipping bag containing shrimp to be filled with 1 3 to 1 2 water this maximizes the trapped oxygen in the bag during shipping this only applies loosely to the bags that are just normal plastic if shipping with these bags see if seller can use pure oxygen opposed to just air fill your tank with water that you have added dechlorinator to chlorine and chloramines will kill shrimp so make sure you get a dechlorinator that neutralizes both get the shrimp used to the water using these steps put the bag into the water and clip it to the tank side using a binder clip add 1 4 cup tank water to the bag perhaps use 1 turkey baster full of water wait 15 minutes repeat 2 more times an alternative to this is to test the bag s water parameters and your tank s if it is similar just acclimate them to the temperature and dump them into the tank cherries are very hardy and hard to kill relative to other shrimp 2 x research source dump the shrimp in the tank the temperature and water parameters like ph should have equalized enough not to shock the shrimp set your heater to about 80 f 27 c 3 x research source use another thermometer like a digital if you can afford it to verify your heater is working accurately check it daily when you feed them feed the shrimp flake food sinking pellets or blanched squash or zucchini shrimp eat anything a fish would 4 x research source you do not even need small pieces of food as they will rip off a piece of flake and feed it to themselves some shrimp do not like algae tablets some do foods with copper compounds are not ok for rcs if there is still food in the tank when you feed them skip that feeding and check again later feed very small amounts once per day especially if you just start with 10 shrimp a flake the size of your pinky fingernail should last 10 rcs about 2 perhaps 3 days do not overfeed as it will result in harmless worms like detritus or planaria if this happens do a water change and if you have no rcs babies then do a gravel vac and start to feed less food or not as often to blanch zucchini put one slice in a microwave safe bowl cover with about an inch or so or 3cm of water cook on high for 1 minute let cool for 20 minutes then drop into tank if the zucchini floats weight it down with a zip tie a piece of plastic or a marble but not metal if water temperature is warm enough and there is enough food they will simply breed female shrimp should get greenish or yellowish eggs under their tail within 30 days of you receiving them if they don t already have eggs 5 x research source female shrimp get a yellowish saddle shaped patch behind their head these are eggs in their ovaries the eggs should move to their tails in 7 10 days once the eggs are under their tails the eggs will hatch in 3 4 weeks you will notice how the mom fans the eggs occasionally to prevent fungus from growing on them the eggs will hatch faster if the water is warmer you may wake up one day to find tiny clear shrimp on the plants or on the bottom baby rcs look just like the adults but they are very small about 2mm long and clear but their shape is the same as an adult rcs shrimp will not eat their babies unless they are starving besides the babies are quick to get away maintain the tank a 10 gallon or 40 litre tank can safely hold 100 150 adult rcs if you change 25 of the water each week without exception do not vacuum the bottom of the tank baby shrimp get a lot of their daily food out of the waste however too much waste will cause a buildup of nitrates high nitrates can kill shrimp,Pets-and-Animals
how to protect coral reefs,coral reefs are unique biologically rich and complex ecosystems that are sometimes called the rainforests of the ocean pollution disease invasive species and unaware tourists all cause them harm the decline of coral reefs destabilizes the world ecology and can have negative economic impact coral reefs control the amount of carbon dioxide in the ocean making them critical to the food chain there are ways that you can help protect coral reefs,avoid striking or touching a coral reef running your boat into a coral reef can cause it serious damage protecting coral reefs depends on what experts call proper vessel management understand where coral reefs are so your boat doesn t strike them even incidentally people can also damage coral reefs simply by touching them 1 x research source corals on reefs are actually small animals this living ecosystem is thus very fragile and susceptible to damage the coral animals are not mobile they live in colonies and possess skeletons of hard calcium carbonate which is what gives the coral reef its structure remember the feet control your flippers when diving or snorkeling so you don t accidentally touch a coral reef don t fish or boat near a coral reef contact with things like anchors and fishing nets is a key way that coral reefs die or suffer damage do not anchor your boat on a coral reef instead anchor your boat in an area with a sandy bottom or use a mooring you could also use an installed buoy instead of an anchor 2 x research source fishing lines nets and fishing hooks all cause damage to coral reefs this is just another reason why it s best to take your fishing elsewhere figure out where coral reefs are located before you venture into the ocean do not discharge wastewater from your boat into the ocean find an acceptable wastewater discharge facility in the area instead 3 x research source do not litter on the beach or in the ocean leaving behind things like fishing nets or general garbage on a beach can harm coral reefs throwing litter into the ocean itself can eventually cause the trash to come into contact with the coral reef when trash ends up on a coral reef it can actually smother the corals remember they are living organisms sometimes people see corals as they see shells however corals are alive and thus they are very susceptible to harm 4 x research source littering can also cause harm or even kill the fish that populate coral reefs the technical term for this kind of litter is marine debris marine debris also damages other organisms on coral reefs that are necessary for their survival some organizations sponsor beach cleanups if you help pick up other people s litter on beaches in addition to not littering yourself you will help coral reefs snorkel and scuba dive with care many people enjoy snorkeling near coral reefs because of their unique beauty snorkelers and divers can cause serious damage to coral reefs especially in areas with heavy tourism definitely do not pull a piece of coral reef off to take with you they say you should leave only bubbles and take only pictures when you are in the ocean remember that you are destroying a living organism if you do take a piece of the reef practice snorkeling before you venture anywhere near a coral reef so you don t come into accidental contact with it 5 x research source stay horizontal in the water and avoid kicking sand or flailing around with your fins don t swim too fast or use your arms when swimming 6 x research source if you touch a coral reef it can cause you harm too people have been cut and stung by coral reefs 7 x research source do not get close to a coral reef while wearing a lot of sunscreen the oils from the lotion causes coral reefs damage 8 x research source don t purchase coral souvenirs you shouldn t take anything out of the ocean that s alive or buy it in a store either in some countries you will find jewelry and other souvenirs made out of coral don t buy them 9 x research source it is illegal to sell coral in some countries coral can take a long time to grow so taking it for your aquarium or jewelry box can have a lasting effect that will take years to undo 10 x research source red and pink coral is especially prized as jewelry because of its coloring it comes from deeper waters don t purchase coral reef fish either inquire about marine fish before you buy them in pet stores you want fish that were bred in captivity 11 x research source choose a hotel that embraces environmentalism hotels can make a big impact on the environment they are often close to shores and a lot of people pass through them support hotels with policies designed to reduce pollution hotels that have programs to treat sewage and offer recycling and other sustainability measures can help protect coral reefs by improving the overall environment around them 12 x research source tourism associated with coral reefs is one of the fastest growing segments of the tourism industry so it could make a big difference if more hotels are pressured by consumers to adopt sustainable practices 13 x research source practice general conservation coral reefs are damaged when the general environment around them declines so you can help protect coral reefs simply by leading a more sustainable lifestyle plant trees trees reduce runoff into oceans and runoff can damage coral reefs reduce your carbon footprint this really matters increasing carbon dioxide in the air can lead to global warming which can harm coral reefs it s all interconnected ways to reduce your carbon footprint include biking to work and using a clothes line 14 x research source use less water this will help decrease runoff which is a key way that coral reefs are harmed use organic fertilizer to avoid chemicals running into the ecosystem don t assume that chemicals in your garden or on your farm won t find their way back into the ocean just because you don t live near it avoid near shore development and construction some coral reefs are located near shores they can be damaged by various aspects of land development and construction including the building of marinas docks and plowing of fields 15 x research source when sediment and silt loosen because of development and construction and end up in the ocean this can block sunlight and cause corals to die because they need sunlight to thrive sediment can actually bury the corals killing them or stopping them from growing completely metals pesticide herbicide and other chemicals associated with mining and runoff from landfills agricultural and urban development projects can damage corals as well as the fish around them oppose global warming general worsening of the environment is an indirect way that people are causing harm to coral reefs they are very sensitive to rising water temperatures which cause them harm reducing your carbon footprint also helps stop global warming as little as a one degree rise in water temperature causes coral reef damage coral bleaching is a key indicator that coral reefs are unhealthy and it s been increasing since the 1980s algae inside the reef provide its color and bleaching of the coral occurs when algae are either missing or die 16 x research source warmer ocean temperatures can also spur the growth of algae that is harmful to coral reefs because it blocks the sun that they need to thrive when oceans heat up they have more carbon dioxide in them this slows the growth of coral reefs by making it harder for corals to create calcium carbonate skeletons boycott damaging fishing methods if you consume fish caught in a way that damages coral reefs you are part of the problem not using products obtained through damaging the environment is a way to help protect the reefs understand which fish are caught in a way that damages reefs and spread the word in some countries people actually blow up coral reefs with explosives so they can more easily catch the fish that cluster around them then they sell the fish to restaurants and stores another devastating fishing method involves putting cyanide into the water to stun fish this kills the coral reefs around them 17 x research source overfishing is another way that damage is caused to coral reefs there is economic pressure in some countries to fish in this manner because coral reefs can provide as much as one quarter of the fish eaten in some developing countries 18 x research source don t eat fish caught with bottom trawling methods bottom trawling is so damaging that it can destroy reefs that could live for thousands more years and exist deep in the ocean an example of a fish sometimes caught through bottom trawling is orange roughy 19 x research source volunteer to support reef science since 1998 the u s government has extensively mapped coral reefs to track their decline the governmental efforts often link with private groups that accept donations and volunteers as well as state and local efforts to protect reefs global efforts also exist to protect reefs in australia the government has created ways for people to get involved to help protect the great barrier reef the government has created a monitoring program that allows average people to contribute to reef protection by reporting their own observations and data 20 x research source scientists study detailed maps that alert them to bleaching of coral reefs which can be caused by rising sea temperatures and algal blooms 21 x research source the data is so sophisticated that scientists receive updates every hour focusing on coral reefs in hawaii puerto rico and the u s virgin islands they monitor barometric pressure tide levels air and water temperature and other factors important to coral reefs scientists are breeding coral reefs and then testing different varieties in environments with greater acidity and other conditions 22 x research source they have also found ways to plant corals in the ocean and to spur their growth by using electrical currents help organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs there are many organizations that work hard to stop destruction of coral reefs some even build artificial reefs to replace destroyed or damaged coral reefs the coral reef alliance reef relief and planetary coral reef foundation are examples of private organizations trying to save coral reefs the organizations and others like them offer numerous ways for people to get involved 23 x research source you can sign up as a volunteer for a coral reef organization and become involved in events and education join a reef cleanup 24 x research source many of the organizations rely on donations some reef protection organizations have educational programs for children reef relief offers a coral camp in key west florida to educate children about the value of coral reefs tell others about coral reefs many people touch or otherwise harm coral reefs without intending to do so they may simply not understand that reefs are full of fragile living creatures or realize that the smallest contact can cause them harm helping educate as many people as possible about coral reefs can make a difference

how to take care of a live clam,clams are a wonderful low maintenance addition to any tank as they naturally filter out some microorganisms and make beautiful decorative structures on the bottom of your aquarium however just because they are low maintenance doesn t mean that they don t require any work at all with a little knowledge you can easily make clams a part of your next aquatic ecosystem,place clams in well established tanks for the best results clams are animals not plants though they are often marketed as filters this is only partially true unlike plants which filter chemicals out of the water and use light to make food clams are filter feeders meaning that they eat small organisms and algae that they pull out of the water a brand new tank however will not have any other life developed meaning your clams could starve without proper care 1 x research source provide a sandy bottom for your clams clams like to hide and feel safe sitting in the bottom of the tank and filtering out all the food waste and leftovers that drift down to the bottom you want roughly 4 inches 10 2 cm of sand for them to nest in make sure you rinse your substrate sand off before adding it to the tank especially if you ve taken it from a natural environment you want a nice fine substrate something with a grain size between 1 to 3mm 2 x research source add other fish to create a vibrant aquarium system around your clams snails and coldwater fish all create food waste and scrapes that are perfect to feed your clams with a strong ecosystem around them most clams will need little other maintenance beyond the occasional checkup as they eat the leftovers of the other fish they can also keep your tank clean by filtering our some algae and microorganisms freshwater puffers some catfish species and loaches will all eat clams if they get hungry enough so it is best to keep them in separate tanks 3 x research source augment your clams natural food with feedings 1 2 a week your clams can eat a lot of the food leftover by the rest of the tank but especially in newer tanks with fewer organisms they will need some extra food to truly thrive this is especially essential if you have a lot of clams or many larger adult clams you can use clam food found at your local pet store and often sold as sinking algae wafers or you can make your own mixture pureed in a blender and given to your clams individually 1 3 pound red meat hamburger beef liver beef heart or fish with roe beef blood drippings from beef package 1 tsp cod liver oil ¼ tsp yeast 2 3 tablespoons water from the aquarium the clams live in note the speed a clam closes up to measure health a good healthy clam will spring closed quickly if you touch it or it feels like it is being threatened this is a naturally clammy defense mechanism every 2 3 weeks pull your clams out and make sure that they close up quickly since they bury themselves in the sand finding dead clams can be tough but you can make it easier on yourself poke 10 20 holes in a clean single serving applesauce container place 2 3 clams depending on size into the container cover them in sand so that the tops are still visible at the top place the container at the bottom of your tank removing it with your clams whenever you need to check on them 4 x research source remove dead clams from your tank quickly dead clams release a large spike of ammonia which can damage or even kill other animals in the tank this is why checking your clams regularly is so important make sure that they still close up rapidly if they won t close at all they ve likely died and should be discarded dead clams also have a rank fishy odor if you are unsure if a clam is dead try making a small separate maintenance tank feed them and provide a nice sandy bottom and see if they begin to react after 4 5 days 5 x research source do not rely on clams to filter your water clams are not water filtration systems and they will not keep your tank clean and happy all on their own you still need a water filtration system plants and carefully monitored water levels to ensure that your tank is healthy and happy do not place saltwater clams in new or immature aquariums you cannot simply add saltwater to a tank and expect a clam to survive as it needs a variety of microorganisms to be well established before it can feed clams are best in well established aquariums that have had several weeks or months to cycle saltwater clams go by the names t tridacna maxima t crocea t squamosa and t derasa tridacna derasa clams are the best beginner options as they are hearty and can handle a variety of changing conditions once you ve successfully put several fish in the tank and let them spend several weeks living healthily you re likely ready for clams 6 x research source place clams on the bottom of the tank where they can establish themselves while it may look good never place a clam up on a rock or structure if it becomes detached and falls it can cause major damage and potentially kill the clam solid rocky bottoms are fine as saltwater clams have a foot that they use to attach to the bottom of the tank 7 x research source when you put the clam in the tank turn it upside down briefly to remove any air bubbles from inside the clam make sure that the clams aren t wedged into anything the prevents them from opening up ensure that your clams have adequate bright lights saltwater clams are photosynthetic and feed off the products off other photosynthetic creatures like plants in your tank they have symbiotic algae in their mantles top section that create energy that the clams then harvest as such they love having bright constant lights to feed under metal halides are your best option though high level leds or fluorescents may suffice make sure the clams face upwards and are not blocked from their light source maxima clams in particular need 250 400 watt metal halide lighting or equivalent intensity to survive 8 x research source keep the water movement low and calm clams do not like rapid or fast moving water as it disrupts their ability to filter food out of the water effectively indirect slow moving currents are the best way to keep your clams healthy and happy keep your clams out of direct currents and away from pumps or fans keep phosphate and nitrate levels low clams survive well in near natural seawater conditions which is where you likely keep a saltwater tank already if you re not already however keep the phosphate and nitrate levels at an absolute minimum potential near zero 9 x research source check how quickly a clam closes up to monitor its health a clam when touched or exposed to a shadow should close up quickly if it does not it likely needs more food and or light or your tank could be having chemical issues if a clam does not close up at all it may be dead and should be quickly removed dead clams release a burst of ammonia which can endanger the rest of the life in your tank 10 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to raise rabbits,rabbits are lovely pets to have a rabbit is tame and playful and yet also social however it does take a lot of work to take care of a rabbit like all pets rabbits need a clean healthy environment and the right kind of food in order to thrive,keep your rabbits indoors some rabbit breeders prefer outdoor living quarters as it allows rabbits to experience fresh air and sunshine however keeping your rabbit outdoor s can scare and overwhelm your rabbit furthermore experts say that because rabbits are social creatures they might benefit more from being indoors and around humans if you decide to keep your rabbits outdoors it s important that they are kept out of the sun cold and rain outdoor rabbits need to be given extra bedding when it s cold out if temperatures dip below freezing consider moving the rabbit hutch to a more protected environment like a garage or shed be aware that being outdoors leaves rabbits vulnerable to predators even the sight of a predator can cause heart attacks in caged rabbits rabbits can also catch diseases if they re housed outside choose a proper cage consider the size of the cage so your pets have enough room rabbits can get sore hocks on any surface if not cared for properly making sure your rabbit has a clean surface to walk on is important to prevent sore hocks and other foot issues cages should be large enough for your rabbits to stand upright lie down and move around freely 2 x research source 3 x research source build your rabbits a run your pets will need daily exercise and a run allows your rabbits to move around without getting anywhere in the house that could be dangerous a rabbit in the wild may cover hundreds of feet on any given day so having room to roam safely is crucial for your pets if you don t have room for a run indoors you can put a run in your yard the run should be spacious but it should be secure in case the rabbit or rabbits try to escape always keep the run in the shade and supply water if there is no shade in your yard you may need to put a detachable roof over the run 4 x research source make your rabbits comfortable try to keep your rabbit in a cool low humidity environment ideally between 60 70 degrees fahrenheit 15 5 21 1 degrees celsius 5 x research source set up your rabbit s cage in a quiet part of the house or yard and be sure that your rabbits won t be harassed by other animals 6 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source allow your new rabbit to acclimate to your home before you introduce it to larger pets like dogs this can be stressful and overwhelming allowing rabbits and other pets to mingle is important but it should be done gradually and under close supervision feed your rabbit a healthy diet a rabbit s diet should consist of grass fresh vegetables and timothy hay or oat hay more specifically a rabbit should have an unlimited supply of hay you can also feed your rabbit store bought pellets however pellets should be fed in small amounts one of the most trusted brands for pellets and timothy hay is oxbow make sure that you get your rabbit the right kind of pellets youth pellets if the rabbit is under 6 months adult if the rabbit is older than 6 months high fiber pellets should be offered daily but in small quantities to prevent health problems rabbits under four pounds can be given 1 4 cup of pellets as a general rule you can add another 1 4 cup of pellets daily for every additional two pounds of body weight on your rabbit 7 x research source young rabbits can be given alfalfa hay but alfalfa is not a healthy option for adults it s recommended that you switch your rabbit to timothy hay before it reaches one year old give your rabbit fresh water daily it s important to change your rabbit s water every day to prevent bacteria from growing use a water bowl made of ceramic rabbit safe plastic or metal as these are easier to clean 8 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source some pet owners prefer sipper bottles because they cannot be easily tipped over in the cage however rabbits get dehydrated easily with a sipper bottle the sipper bottles can also collect germs at the spout choose a water container that works best for you and your pet empty your rabbit s litter box every 2 4 days this will not only reduce the risk of unpleasant odors but it will also keep your rabbit healthy and happy 9 x research source if you are just starting out training your rabbit to use a litter box you should be able to tell which corner your rabbit goes in to relieve itself if you put some newspaper or a litter box down there your rabbit will quickly learn to use the box you may want to scoop out urine soaked litter on a daily basis to keep your rabbit clean and keep the litter box smelling fresh remember that rabbits are coprophagic rabbits excrete two kinds of droppings fecal pellets round hard dry waste product and cecotropes large soft light colored droppings 10 x research source the digestive system of rabbits requires that the animal eats its cecotropes in order to adequately absorb and digest the nutrients found in food 11 x research source when cleaning out the litter box remove hard dry fecal pellets but be sure to leave cecotropes behind these droppings are an essential part of your pet s diet clean your rabbit s cage once every week use white vinegar to clean your rabbit s litter box or soak it for stains that are tough to remove 12 x research source spot cleaning should be done daily 13 x research source clean the cage out while your rabbits are in the run change soiled bedding daily straw makes an excellent bedding material and is easy to change every day 14 x research source clean out the food bowl and change the food daily do not overfeed your rabbit food portions should be commensurate with the size and weight of your rabbit give your rabbit plenty of attention rabbits are social animals and you will need to handle your rabbit gently and frequently in order for it to grow comfortable being picked up 15 x trustworthy source best friends animal society nonprofit animal welfare organization dedicated to saving animal lives by operating and supporting no kill animal shelters go to source brush your rabbit at least once every week long haired rabbits will need daily brushings and will also need regular trimmings to keep their coats around one inch or shorter 16 x research source remove mats with a mat splitter or mat rake 17 x research source trim your rabbit s nails as needed if you are uncomfortable doing this on your own you may take your rabbit to a veterinarian or to an animal groomer to have this done 18 x research source do not bathe your rabbit bathing can be very traumatic and is unnecessary as rabbits tend to groom themselves if you notice a soiled area on your rabbit you may want to spot wash it with a wet towel but do not submerge your rabbit in water 19 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to build a reptile cage,a reptile cage must do more than keep your reptile inside it must provide it a safe comfortable home and allow your reptile to enjoy his natural behaviors the needs of reptiles vary according to species and you must research what the needs of your reptile are before building him a cage,consider the behavior of your reptile think about the type of reptile you have does your reptile need water what type of light does your reptile need is your reptile young how large is the reptile expected to grow will the cage be kept inside or outside the cage should resemble the reptile s natural habitat as much as possible 1 x research source for example a chameleon would need a tube cage turtles frogs and some snakes will need water in the tank some reptiles eat other insects and animals such as crickets and mice your cage needs to be able to accommodate those animals as well you do not want those animals escaping into your home choose materials to work with the materials you choose for the cage will depend on your budget and the needs of your reptile cages are typically made using screen or mesh plastic or wooded or acrylic or glass boxes 2 x research source also consider how often you will need to clean the cage unless you have experience working with acrylic and glass buy pre cut panels the panels can be attached together or you can attach the panels to a wood or plastic frame 3 x research source plastic cages are more expensive last longer and hold heat better than glass cages 4 x research source melamine high pressure particle board with a decorative laminate coating looks good holds up well and is easy to clean but it s heavy other options include a good grade of plywood or pre cut shelving boards walls can be made of wood glass transparent thermoplastic or coated wire mesh consider building a reptile cage out of existing items such as an aquarium old chest of drawers entertainment center or a refrigerator with the door removed determine the size of the cage you need your reptile should have room to move around and hide in its cage there should also be enough room to incorporate the necessary lighting heating and flooring most cages are rectangular in shape small reptiles such as leopard geckos and garter snakes need two to six square feet of space 5 x research source medium sized reptiles such as pythons need six to eight square feet of space small reptiles that move around a lot such as bearded dragons need eight to 32 square feet of space 6 x research source large reptiles such as iguanas tortoises and constrictors need a closet or room size for a cage 7 x research source ventilate the cage wire mesh pegboard and holes are all ventilation options for example screen and mesh are needed for reptiles such as chameleons that need plenty of airflow the ventilation you choose should be based on the needs of your reptile ventilation holes should either be too small for the reptile to escape through or covered with wire mesh hardware cloth or black window screen don t use wire mesh in snake cages pegboard is good if the reptile likes to rub its nose against things if you are concerned about the reptile s nails injuring the cage you can use quarter inch plastic coated hardware cloth create a sketch of the cage once you have chosen the size of the cage and the materials you plan to use make a sketch of the cage you plan to build this will help you determine exactly what you need to buy and help you develop a game plan for building the cage also measure the area where you plan on placing the cage to make sure that there will be enough room make a list of the tools that you will need such as a chisel drill saw etc also gather any screws hinges glue or adhesive that you may need plan your approach to building the cage decide what pieces you will put together first will you use pre cut materials or cut your own construct the cage attach the walls of the cage using wood or glue plexiglass and wood will require screws create cut outs for ventilation as well construct a door for the cage and apply hinges or latches to the door frames 8 x research source doors should always open sideways or down if you have to hold the door up with one hand cleaning the cage or caring for your reptile will be more difficult put the door in a place that allows you to reach all areas of the cage easily a badly placed or sized door may make it more difficult for you to care for your reptile do not place hinges on top of the door make sure that all of the hinges screws lids and doors are sturdy you do not want your reptile to escape from the cage add any finishing touches sand down any rough areas or sharp edges seal the bottom of the cage so substrate water and excrement don t leak out you can use non toxic silicone sealant and a durable plastic sheeting cover the raw edges of any wire mesh inside the cage if you plan to paint or decorate the wood stain bare wood and apply a topcoat such as polyurethane to protect it be sure to air it thoroughly afterward so fumes don t sicken your reptile choose the substrate flooring flooring choices include sand fine beach sand playground sand silica sand gravel stones lava rock pea gravel polished stones wood and paper products bark mulch butcher paper newspaper paper towels shavings soils and mosses sphagnum moss potting soil spanish moss or litter cat litter clay litter alfalfa pellets 9 x research source the type of substrate you use will depend on the needs of your reptile when in doubt seek professional advice from a reptile specialist some substrates for example sand can readily cause gut impactions if the lizards eats some when feeding off insects wood is best for arboreal species of reptiles such as lizards that do not spend a lot of time on the ground 10 x research source paper towels and newspapers can be shredded and placed on the bottom of the cage these materials are inexpensive and are easy to clean up but they do not help with odor control coconut fiber is good for reptiles that need a high humidity environment and helps control odor it is also good for reptiles that like to burrow and hide 11 x research source moss is good for high humidity reptiles and is good for reptiles that like to burrow as well 12 x research source sand works for desert species reptiles however it can be harmful if large amounts are ingested 13 x research source never use soil grass bark or other substrates from the park or your yard they may contain organisms and bacteria that may be harmful to your reptile 14 x research source add heat to the reptile cage all reptiles need an external heat source because they cannot control their own body temperature and many of them come from warm climates if your reptile spends most of his time on branches or in the upper portion of the cage he will need basking heat if your reptile spends most of his time on the ground you will need ground heat all cages need a thermometer as well the ideal temperature is between 20 and 32 ºc 68 to 89 6 ºf 15 x research source ceramic heaters basking lamps and basking lights can be used to provide basking heat basking lights are used to create a desert environment basking lamps have time limits 14 hours in the summer and 8 hours during the winter and must be monitored 16 x research source heat mats and pads hot rocks and heat cable and ropes provide ground heat heat mats and pads provide constant heat hot rocks are best for nocturnal reptiles but may malfunction from time to time choose your hot rocks mats and pads carefully some mats get too hot and the reptile could burn his belly lying on it heat cables and ropes are flexible and can be wrapped around different objects heat cables and ropes get very hot you will need to use a rheostat to monitor the temperature do not place a basking light above a heat pad this can cause the temperature of the heat pad to reach unsafe levels and can hurt your reptile provide ultraviolet uv light most reptiles need full spectrum lights that provide either uva or uvb light proper lighting will keep your reptile healthy and happy and provide adequate levels of vitamin d3 and calcium the specific light you use will depend on the type of reptile you have 17 x research source lights should be placed 12 to 18 inches from where the reptile will lie lights that provide 4 to 10 of radiation as uvb are best depending on the animal you will most likely need at least two uv bulbs it is best to switch your lights on and off including the uv to mimic day length in the habitat in which your lizard lives in the wild lights should be replaced every six months regardless of whether they appear to be functioning this is because the uv levels emitted drop off markedly after six months incandescent lights will add heat to a cage while you can use this type of light as a heat source take care that it doesn t make the cage too hot install lights outside the cage if possible if you choose to install a bulb inside the cage build a shield around it so the reptile doesn t come into contact with it furnish the cage with items that simulate your reptile s natural environment put in tree branches for species that like to climb and flat rocks for those who enjoy basking under a heat lamp give your reptile places to hide ideally one hide at the warm end and one hide at the cool end of the cage purchase the furnishings from a pet store or trusted online retailer branches sticks and leaves from our natural environment may be harmful for your reptile consider your reptile s water and food needs some need a large dish they can climb into while others need a drip bottle to drink from observe your reptile in the cage place your reptile inside and observe his behavior closely to make sure he is comfortable a reptile that acts strangely or is constantly trying to escape may be in distress requiring that you make adjustments or build a more suitable cage,Pets-and-Animals
how to identify shark teeth,a trip to the beach can be really fun but even more so when you find a cool shark tooth to bring home you may wonder how you can increase your chances of finding shark teeth at the beach or once you find a tooth you may wonder what kind of shark it came from or how old it is luckily there are ways that you can find these things out,search for teeth at the tide line and the shoreline go to the beach at low tide and look for the line of debris in the sand walk slowly along this tide line as you keep your eyes peeled for teeth if the beach is busy you might have more luck looking right where the waves are crashing into the shoreline so that you can snag teeth before others see them 1 x research source every now and then dig up some of the sand along the tide line and or shoreline and search through it for teeth while teeth can be found on the surface of the sand they re also often found underneath sift through shells and sand to find shark teeth if there are a lot of shells in the areas where you search it might be a good idea to grab a big pile of shells and sort through them scoop up some shells and dig up a little bit of sand that s underneath put the shells and sand into a sifter and shake it then take one object out at a time and observe it to see if it s a tooth a shell or something else 2 x research source while it s possible to find teeth where there aren t a lot of shells and or debris you may have more luck in areas where shells and debris have collected look for dark triangular shapes while shark teeth are subtly unique to each other the teeth that you might find will most likely be black or another similar dark color they will also probably be smaller between about 0 5 inches 1 3 cm and 2 inches 5 1 cm in length and in the shape of a triangle focus on these physical characteristics as you scan the sand and sift through shells 3 x research source identify teeth by their glossy quality shark teeth and seashells can sometimes look very similar to each other if you pick up an object and can t quite tell which one it is hold it up to the sunlight if it s a shell the object will likely have ripples and some iridescence while nearly all shark teeth tend to appear glossy in the light 4 x research source recognize white shark teeth by their broad triangular shape if you have a shark tooth that s flat and in the shape of a wide triangle then you may have a white shark tooth on your hands 5 x research source there should be coarse serrations along the blade of the tooth and it should also be about 1 5 2 5 inches 3 8 6 4 cm long 6 x research source identify tiger shark teeth by their short blades tiger shark teeth blades are only about as long as their roots they can also be identified by the sharp serrations on the shoulders of their blades and also by how deeply notched their blades typically are 7 x research source tiger shark teeth are typically about 1 inch 2 5 cm long but they can sometimes be as long as 1 5 2 inches 3 8 5 1 cm recognize bull shark teeth by their tapering serrations bull shark teeth have blades that are flat and broad with a narrow apex these teeth are usually 1 inch 2 5 cm long or slightly shorter while there are serrations along the entire blade they get smaller and smaller further down the blade 8 x research source identify a lemon shark tooth by its slightly angled blade lemon shark teeth have no serrations and the blade is angled to the side very slightly lemon shark teeth blades are also flat and narrow 9 x research source the average length for lemon shark teeth is about 0 75 inches 1 9 cm 10 x research source spot a sand tiger shark s tooth by its narrowness sand tiger shark teeth have extremely narrow blades that are free of serrations and typically measure about 1 inch 2 5 cm in length 11 x research source this makes them relatively easy to identify they also have very high cusps 12 x research source identify megalodon teeth by their large size a megalodon is a type of shark that has been extinct for thousands of years but it s remembered for its massive size you can typically identify this type of tooth by its size alone because it s so much bigger than other shark teeth as megalodon teeth typically range from 3 5 7 inches 8 9 17 8 cm long 13 x research source you can also identify these by their finely serrated blades and the thin black line that s located between the blade and the root of the tooth 14 x research source identify other shark teeth species by their shapes and sizes shark teeth from different species tend to stand apart from each other in these ways the shape of the tooth is often the most telling as most species have a uniquely angled blade shaped cusp or serration quality that identifies it as that particular species if you think a tooth could ve come from 1 of 2 possible species measure its length and see if it fits more with the size of 1 species or the other 15 x research source for example great hammerhead shark teeth stand out because they have a uniquely square root and serrations from the top to the bottom of the blade that are a consistent size identify fossilized teeth by their dark coloring shark teeth contain oxygen which can react with surrounding minerals to create colors over time fossilized shark teeth have had at least 10 000 years for this oxidation to take effect so they re often black deep red brown grey or another similar dark color 16 x research source this varies based on the environment that the tooth has fossilized in because different sediments contain minerals that create different colors through oxidization 17 x research source shark teeth that are found in areas that contain iron oxide such as parts of new jersey tend to have an orange or red coloring shark teeth found in areas that contain a lot of phosphate such as venice beach florida tend to be black as phosphate is a dense black mineral 18 x research source identify modern teeth by their lighter color modern teeth haven t yet been exposed to the minerals in surrounding sediments for the 10 000 years that it takes to cause oxidation as a result these teeth are typically white and usually appear much like they did when they were in the mouth of the shark they came from 19 x research source find out the species and see if it s extinct try determining the general age of the tooth by observing its anatomy and finding out what kind of species it came from while many shark teeth that you may find can come from sharks like tiger sharks and great white sharks that exist today you could find one that comes from an extinct species if you notice that the anatomy of a tooth matches that of an extinct species the tooth is extremely old 20 x research source the megalolamna paradoxodon is one example of an extinct shark species that you could possibly find the teeth of 21 x research source recognize teeth that are found inland as old while you can certainly find fossilized shark teeth at the beach both modern and fossilized teeth are frequently found in this location if you find a tooth significantly inland then there s a high chance that it s very old because it would take a long time for the tooth to be moved far away from the ocean by the elements 22 x research source for instance if you find a shark tooth in a creek that s 50 miles 80 5 kilometers inland it s probably a fossilized tooth,Pets-and-Animals
how to take action to preserve nature,being concerned about the environment can feel overwhelming but there are actions that you can take to help preserve the natural world start by finding ways to protect the landbase and waterways in your own community and neighborhood it s also important to reduce your own carbon footprint and make sustainable eating choices you can maximize your actions by raising awareness of local environmental challenges among your friends and family or joining with other activists to push for policies that protect nature,stop mowing your lawn the grasses and weeds will go to seed and offer haven for insects and birds wildflowers will bloom providing nourishment for bees when you maintain a standard grass lawn you re depriving these creatures of their natural environment 1 x research source you might wish to set aside part of your lawn to leave unmown or you might decide to mow paths through longer grassy areas be prepared to share your reasons with your neighbors who might at first not realize the benefits of long grass participate in beach or river cleanup when people litter their trash often makes its way to our local waterways destroying the natural homesites of birds fish and other wetland creatures help out by joining with others in beach or riverside cleanup events 2 x research source if there s not a cleanup in your area consider creating one all you ll need are trash bags rubber gloves and a team of like minded volunteers you can select any lake river creek swamp marsh beach or wetland you prefer to help clean stop using pesticides rather than spraying toxic pesticides that are dangerous to humans pets fish and birds alter the garden environment in a way that causes the pests to leave this is a more environmentally friendly solution 3 x research source try using beneficial insects that can control the pest population or natural pesticides which have been developed to make the plant taste bad to the pest you can find these at your local garden store or online 4 x research source pesticides include insecticides herbicides biocides fungicides and nematicides plant native trees and shrubs by planting trees and shrubs that are native to your area you ll be working with the local ecosystem rather than against it check with your local nursery or with your state s cooperative extension agency to learn more about the particular varieties of native plants that might thrive on your property planting native plants helps with water conservation once established little or no irrigation should be needed for most well placed native plants you ll be increasing the local biodiversity establishing native pollinator and songbird habitats in your yard catch your rainwater a ½ inch of rain on a 1000 sq foot roof produces about 280 gallons of water that you can then use to irrigate your garden and clean items around your home most people use a rain barrel to save their rainwater until it s used for irrigation you can put a rain barrel directly beneath your gutter or you can install a diverter that pulls water from your water drainage system 5 x research source rainwater isn t safe for drinking it should only be used for irrigation and cleaning purposes saving your rainwater helps protect nature by preventing stormwater runoff from carrying trash nutrients and other pollution to your local lakes and streams plant flowers that bees will like small diverse plantings that bloom for multiple seasons will help support your local bee population there are many reasons that bees are vital to your local ecosystem including pollination of fruit trees and food crops 6 x research source examples of favorites among bees include borage cleome cosmos bee balm or monarda verbena and zinnia herbs that bees frequent include rosemary thyme mint basil and all kinds of sage or salvia join an environmental activist organization you can maximize the impact of your action by joining together with others who want to preserve nature being a part of an activist organization will help you keep abreast of any environmental legislation or changes in legal threats to natural environments 7 x research source be aware that there are organizations with environmental sounding names that actually work to dismantle legal protection for natural space research the organization thoroughly before getting involved with action for example the center for whale research does research on orca whales in the pacific northwest but the institute for cetacean research is a front group for japanese whaling operations spend time volunteering most communities have nonprofit environmental organizations that rely on volunteer help in order to do their work look in your local area for organizations that are doing the kind of work to preserve nature that you expect 8 x research source internships and international opportunities are also available to those who are able to travel you might find that your volunteer work leads to new actions and opportunities even if it starts with stapling flyers or doing data entry your actions will help support protection of the environment raise awareness of threats to nature make sure you share news about the threats to the environment both inside and outside your community follow social media campaigns and share their posts write letters to local newspapers and community blogs consider joining in with rallies and protest marches if you re able connect with other activists on social media share information through videos photographs and facts create online polls that are quick to share with friends to collect information sign or create a petition in response to a particular threat while research is unclear on the legislative impacts of signing a petition petitions often serve to raise awareness of particular issues and to draw interest there are a variety of online organizations that make it very easy to create and share your own petition 9 x research source it might help to know that research shows that people who sign online petitions are actually more likely than those who sign paper petitions to follow up with other forms of activism 10 x research source follow up your petition with real life action such as calls to lawmakers organize a march and talk to your friends about doing the same conserve water in your home wait until you ve got a full load of clothes before running the washing machine don t turn on the dishwasher until it s full and allow your dishes to air dry rather than automatically drying 11 x research source by minimizing the amount of drinkable water you use for other purposes you re helping to protect your local water resources which are jeopardized in many areas taking shorter showers or turning off the water while you lather up will save water and money set a timer if you need to use water conserving faucets shower heads and toilets turn the faucet off while you brush your teeth or shave turn off unnecessary lights when you leave a room make sure the lights are off having lights set on a timer may help you reduce the time they re left on if you use lights outdoors make sure they re motion sensitive so that they don t get left on 12 x research source use natural lighting whenever possible and consider installing skylights or light tunnels to light darker areas of the house switch to energy efficient lightbulbs using less electricity translates to fewer greenhouse gases being discharged into the environment from your energy company unplug chargers when they re not in use chargers for your electronic devices are constant energy users even when your device is unplugged reducing your electricity usage benefits the environment and can save you money use biodegradable cleaning products remember that whatever goes down your drains will eventually end up in your local streams and creeks using biodegradable or biocompatible products will have less impact on the local wildlife usually biodegradable products will list this information on their labels look for this designation avoid ingredients that are antibacterial or antibiotic as the ingredients in these can negatively impact the environment also avoid scented products bleach boron borax chlorine bleach or ingredients with the word sodium in them such as sodium hypochlorite consider your transportation options before you fly consider the option of driving if you can drive consider carpooling or taking a train or public transportation if you re in the habit of driving or flying you may be using unnecessary fossil fuels and negatively impacting the environment 13 x research source if you re going to fly try to fly non stop as this will use less fuel consider walking anyplace less than a mile away try biking to nearby destinations look into telecommuting into work occasionally to conserve energy reduce the carbon footprint of your home conserve energy in your home by providing weatherstripping and caulking all windows as well as insulating your ceilings and floors purchase appliances that are energy efficient look for the energy star designation 14 x research source use a programmable thermostat to conserve energy when you re less active make sure your heating and cooling systems are well maintained and operating efficiently make sure the food you re eating is grown sustainably eating sustainably means eating foods that support both your own good health and the sustainability of the environment if you re eating seafood make sure that it s not at risk of being overfished or farmed in a way that s damaging the environment 15 x research source try to buy from local growers whenever possible local farmers are usually invested in employing sustainable farm practices read the labels on your food products if you don t recognize more than ⅓ of the words found there look for something less processed eat lower on the food chain this means eat less beef which is higher on the food chain and more roots vegetables and fruits smaller fish such as anchovies are usually better to eat than larger fish such as tuna which are higher up the food chain and typically higher in mercury plant based foods require still less energy to produce shifting to a more plant based style of eating will slow the deforestation that domestic meat production requires 16 x research source healthy diet guidelines encourage at least 50 of your daily diet consist of fruits and vegetables if you do eat meat treat it as a condiment rather than a main dish be aware that factory farmed meat is produced in ways that contribute to greenhouse gases and environmental degradation learn to hunt deer for a more natural meat source look for food that s grown locally you ll avoid the energy required to transport products from far away in addition getting to know your local food producers will help you understand how your food was grown and harvested 17 x research source most fresh fish must be transported by air if it s not local even out of season frozen fish will be more sustainable than fresh fish flown in 18 x trustworthy source national resources defence council multinational environmental advocacy group focused on grassroots activism and legislative action go to source as the nutritional value of food diminishes with time eating locally grown food increases the amount of nutrition you ll receive 19 x research source buy from trusted retailers many international food growers use unregulated or under regulated environmental practices american grown products while not always perfect are usually farmed with more sustainable practices take the time to research products you purchase regularly 20 x trustworthy source national resources defence council multinational

how to keep coyotes away from campsites or homesteads,coyotes are very smart opportunistic and innovative animals indeed they re so smart that they ve even learned to chase school children to get them to drop their lunch bags 1 x research source as the numbers of coyotes increase they re becoming more courageous and adaptive to our human shaped environments and they re less easily intimidated with brave coyotes starting to venture farther out of the forest and into rural areas and campsites we have both a need and a responsibility to deter them from built environments or where humans are undertaking activities in order to avoid harm to either humans or coyotes,use fencing it is recommended that the fence be at least 6 feet 1 8 meters high and also extend 1 foot 30cm underground the vertical spacing of such a fence should be no more than 4 inches 10cm 2 x research source since coyotes are so smart they will sometimes jump over or dig under fences this is often the case on livestock farms where the temptation is so great that a hungry coyote will do anything to get in barbed wire placed at ground level can deter the coyote from digging under the fence 3 x research source yards and livestock can be protected from coyotes if the fence is high and deep enough be sure to keep the livestock inside the fence or have someone on proper guard if they are being moved or are feeding somewhere else for some time more expensive fencing includes underground aprons and overhangs these can be reserved for feedlots a shelter area corrals or a confinement area to save on costs 4 x research source electric fencing can provide a very useful option at a reasonable price for surrounding large areas of livestock 5 x research source provide a secure shelter for livestock overnight llamas and donkeys can be used as guard animals for livestock protection the donkey should be a jenny or a gelded jack ungelded jacks are too aggressive 6 x research source in the case of donkeys and llamas care needs to be taken that they re not able to socialize with other donkeys or llamas or they may neglect their livestock herd multi species grazing can offer protective benefits such as having sheep goats and cattle together rather than separated try sound sound can have an excellent impact on a coyote that has wandered into your yard or campsite try banging trash can lids or anything else that is noisy to scare the coyote off yell and make a lot of noise in any way possible motion activated alarms can be useful an even more tech savvy option is the new anti coyote sound system this system relies on the fact that cougars occasionally kill coyotes the systems emit replicated cougar sounds and may keep coyotes away propane exploders can be used to deter coyotes on farms and ranches 7 x research source use negative reinforcement or the element of surprise if you happen across a coyote in your yard or campsite as well as the noise steps above there are some other things you can try when you discover a coyote in your locale coyotes dislike novel stimuli and frightening tactics can scare them off initially 8 x research source however you should never make eye contact with the coyote turn your back to it or run away from it as these will signal aggression or offer a temptation to chase and attack if you wish to leave do so calmly or try one of these scaring off tactics spray the coyote with a water hose make yourself appear terrifying with noise and lots of body movements wave your arms about kick your legs up this will let them know that you are the boss and to stay away use children s toys that make noise such as bangs whirs jingles etc use motion activated lighting that will be triggered by the coyote crossing a particular area of the yard having lighting on from dusk to dawn can deter coyotes from entering the lit area 9 x research source there are also strobe lights with sirens which can deter coyotes if used in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions while a vehicle can temporarily deter coyote behavior especially if moved about a lot it can also act as a hiding spot or blind prior to attack so be careful about relying on this method 10 x research source eliminate food sources liked by coyotes while coyotes love flesh food especially rodents they are very opportunistic feeders and will eat anything they come across as such it s important to make it impossible to get food from our environs before all else never try to feed a coyote as a means to try to tame it or help it feeding it is simply reinforcing poor behavior that will encourage them to return and will not tame them some of the ways you can keep down food sources around your yard or campsite include keep all garbage in a coyote proof box or container basically if it s secure and cannot be opened with ease it will deter the coyote ask your local municipality for details if your local store cannot help provide such a container dispose of all food waste properly both at home or at a campsite either place edible waste into a secure garbage container or into a secure compost bin do not leave food waste lying around pick ripe fruit from your trees and remove fruit that has fallen to the ground before it becomes the subject of a coyote feast keep pets away from coyotes cats dogs and other pets can present a reason for attacking mating or as a potential meal to protect your pets if you live in a coyote area or you re camping with a pet do the following keep pets dogs and cats in at night and to keep an eye on them during the day to prevent encounters and to prevent them from being a possible source of the coyote s next meal or attack keep pet food inside or away from where a coyote can forage if you want pets to eat outside bring in all uneaten food as soon as the pet has finished eating spay or neuter your dogs when dogs are ready for mating coyotes will try to mate with them don t use your dog as a coyote guard dog unless he has been properly trained to do so such a dog needs both proper rearing and training to be able to protect livestock from coyote attacks otherwise he can become prey 11 x research source cover fish ponds coyotes eat koi fish that are not protected don t scatter birdseed around even though it doesn t seem like coyote food coyotes are attracted to birdseed collect such birdseed up after the birds have eaten or use a non spilling method of feeding keeping it up high if you want to feed birds remove junk piles from your property these can serve to hide both predator and prey rabbits and other prey liked by coyotes might use junk piles to breed and live in thereby attracting coyotes moreover coyotes can use junk piles to hide behind before making an attack removal of junk piles has several other benefits such as reducing habitat for snakes poisonous insects and spiders or scorpions and it looks better remove all water sources around the yard or campsite these can attract coyotes try wolf urine one natural and innovative answer to the growing coyote problem is the use of wolf urine as a deterrent 12 x research source wolves are one of the coyote s natural predators and coyote populations drop as wolves are reintroduced into an area another odor that might deter coyotes is the common mothball or ammonia soaked rags place these at strategic locations around the yard or campsite if these humane solutions don t help consider calling in a professional many professional wildlife catchers will use live traps so that the coyote doesn t have to pay with his life for trespassing however be aware that relocation isn t effective so it is much better to provide the barriers suggested above so that you can continue to live in harmony with the coyote population,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for sea monkeys,sea monkeys are not actually monkeys and they do not live in the sea in fact sea monkeys are a hybrid breed of brine shrimp created in the 1950s that soon became popular as easy to care for pets and an easy nutritious live food for fish 1 x research source sea monkeys are hatched in unchlorinated saltwater and usually appear within 24 hours they will then develop into tiny translucent shrimp with tails that vaguely resemble the tail of a monkey 2 x research source sea monkeys are low maintenance pets but you need to keep the water clean and well oxygenated at all times,use a clean plastic container many sea monkey kits will come with small plastic tanks you can use to hatch and house your sea monkeys if your kit did not come with a small plastic tank you can use a clean plastic container that can hold at least two liters of water look for a container that has a deep base as sea monkeys often enjoy swimming around at the base area of their tanks fill it with two liters of distilled water you can use bottled water distilled water or any form of unchlorinated water avoid using carbonated water or tap water as it often contains fluoride and other minerals that may not be good for your sea monkeys 3 x research source once you fill the tank with the water you should place the tank indoors so it can warm up to room temperature this will ensure the water will be warm enough for the sea monkey eggs you should also aerate the tank water at least once to twice a day with an air pump or a turkey baster add the water purifier to the water the water purifier or salt packet should come in your sea monkey kit when you buy it in stores or online the water purifier will contain salt which is important for your sea monkeys as it will allow them to hatch in the water and thrive once you put the salt packet in the water give it a stir and let the water sit in room temperature for another day or up to 36 hours before you add the sea monkeys to the tank put the sea monkeys in the water and wait for them to hatch once you pour the sea monkeys into the tank stir the tank water with a clean plastic spoon the sea monkeys will appear as small dots in the water but don t worry they will hatch in around five days and begin swimming around in the tank 4 x research source aerate the water while you wait for the sea monkeys to hatch at least once to twice a day this will ensure there is enough oxygen in the water for your sea monkeys as they develop and hatch start feeding the sea monkeys five days after they hatch rather than feed your sea monkeys as soon as they start hatching you should wait five days on the fifth day from when your sea monkeys hatch you can give them sea monkey food the sea monkey food should come with your sea monkeys as part of a kit 5 x research source use the small end of the feeding spoon to sprinkle one small spoonful of food in their tank you should give them a small spoonful of food every 2 days do not give your sea monkeys fish food or foods other than sea monkey food give them sea monkey food every five days you should feed your sea monkeys every five days to keep them healthy and happy do not overfeed your sea monkeys as this will often kill them sea monkeys are transparent which means you will be able to see their digestive tract if you look at them closely when their digestive tract is full of food they will have a black stripe down the middle of their body once they poop out the food their digestive tract will be clear again feed your sea monkeys less food once algae develops in the tank over time green algae will start to appear in the tank the tank may also smell grassy like a freshly mowed lawn these are all good signs as the green algae actually acts as food for sea monkeys and helps them stay healthy you can switch to feeding your sea monkeys once a week once green algae begins to form and build up in the tank 6 x research source 7 x research source you should also not worry about cleaning the tank once the algae starts to develop the tank may look green and full of algae but it is actually very healthy and good for your sea monkeys that way aerate the tank water twice a day your sea monkeys need oxygen to live happily in their tank if they become oxygen deprived they may turn a pinkish color and appear slow moving or tired to ensure the water has enough oxygen you should aerate the tank twice a day once in the morning and once at night you can use an air pump to aerate the water such as an air pump used in small aquariums stick the air pump in the water and let it aerate the tank for at least one minute twice a day 8 x research source another option is to use a small turkey baster to aerate the tank you can squeeze the turkey baster in the air and then put it in the water and release the air to put more oxygen in the water pull the turkey baster in and out of the water placing air in the water for at least one minute twice a day to make your own air bubbler take a pipette that you aren t planning on using for anything else poke a hole in the very top then poke many tiny holes in the squirting out end either use a pin or staple it several times from different angles with a stapler then remove the staples if you do not want to remember to aerate the tank twice a day you can place a small live plant in the sea monkeys tank to provide oxygen in the water use an underwater aquarium plant that is known to provide good oxygen underwater place the tank in a warm place sea monkeys do best in a spot that s a little over room temperature 9 x research source doug ludemann aquarium specialist personal interview 27 august 2019 you should put their tank in a spot of your house that gets indirect sunlight and is at least 22 celsius 72 fahrenheit this will ensure the tank gets enough heat and is not too cold for your sea monkeys 10 x research source a tank that is too cold will lead to them becoming immobile sea monkeys and sea monkeys that do not grow if you notice the sea monkeys are not moving in their tank or growing it could be because the tank is too cold and needs to be moved to a warmer spot in your home place it in a spot with indirect sunlight so it gets enough heat but does not get too hot do not change the water unless it smells very foul or appears cloudy green algae in the tank is a good thing as the algae acts as food and provides oxygen for your sea monkeys but if you notice the tank smells really bad and the water appears dark and cloudy you may need to clean the tank and the water 11 x research source you will need a coffee filter and a clean glass filled with unchlorinated saltwater use a net to take the sea monkeys out of the tank and place them in the clean glass with water place the coffee filter over a clean tank and run the tank water through the coffee filter several times try to filter out as much of the gunk in the water as possible you can use a paper towel to clean out the bottom and sides of the tank you can also use a q tip to clean out any gunk in the crevices of the tank smell the tank water to check that it no longer smells foul then put the water back in the tank followed by the sea monkeys top up the tank water with purified room temperature water feed your sea monkeys and aerate the tank several times throughout the day then feed them again five days later per their usual feeding schedule make sure the tank always has about 1 2 cup 135 g of salt per 1 gallon 3 8 l of water 12 x research source doug ludemann aquarium specialist personal interview 27 august 2019 watch for any white spots in the tank and remove them if you notice white spots almost like cotton balls in the tank water you should try to remove them as soon as possible they are a type of bacteria that can kill your sea monkeys use a small spoon to get them out of the tank and dispose of them 13 x research source you may want to also put sea medic into the tank which will help to kill any remaining bacteria if they still appear after one to two days you should give the tank a thorough cleaning and replace the water you may lose baby sea monkeys and sea monkey eggs when you dispose of the water but this may be the only way to kill the bacteria use a small flashlight to make the sea monkeys dance and swim around you can play with your sea monkeys using a small flashlight or a penlight move the light against the tank and note how the sea monkeys will chase and follow the light as you move it around they will also gather by the light if you keep it still against the tank you can have fun playing with your sea monkeys by drawing shapes and patterns with the light which they will then swim around and trace in the tank note if the sea monkeys are mating male sea monkeys have whiskers under their chins and female sea monkeys often appear to be carrying eggs when they swim around sea monkeys will mate often so do not be surprised if you see sea monkeys latching onto each other as they swim this is an indication your sea monkeys are mating and more sea monkeys will soon be on their way most sea monkeys live for an average of two years but due to their high mating rates you will likely have a continuous supply of sea monkeys in the tank as long as you care for the tank and the sea monkeys properly,Pets-and-Animals
how to be kind to animals,animals of all kinds enrich our lives they can be our friends or inspire our imagination whether it s a house pet such as a cat a domesticated animal like a horse or even a

hay put a personal item in the space to remind her of your scent create other spaces where your animals can eat play and go to the bathroom keep eating and bathroom spaces as far apart as possible because many animals won t eat near where they defecate allow smaller animals like cats and dogs to live inside with you make sure smaller pets and domesticated animals that stay outside have proper shelter for example any animal needs a roof to protect it from rain snow or other bad weather this is especially important for smaller animals because they are not able to regulate their body temperatures in extreme hot or cold 4 x research source keep your pets and animals spaces as clean as possible for example if you have turtles or fish clean the tank once a week likewise clean a kitty litter box every day 5 x research source feed your animals regularly part of an animal s health is getting daily food and water mealtimes also show your kindness and help establish a bond you re your

towards her pets learn best from positive responses and may learn to fear you if you yell at or hit them report suspected animal abuse unfortunately not every person is kind to animals if you suspect that someone is abusing an animal report it to authorities immediately this is one way to show your kindness to animals some signs of abuse you might see are animals that are chained in yards without proper food water or shelter hitting or kicking animals or even screaming at them avoid forcing any animal chasing after or forcing an animal to approach you if it barks whinnies or hisses at you can cause you harm and traumatize the animal the same goes for attempts to claw kick or bite you remove yourself from the situation to let the animal calm down consider putting yourself at the level of the animal to help calm it 16 x research source kneel down to smaller animals such as dogs cats rabbits or turtles avoid putting your face directly in front of an animal s face which may stress it and cause you harm 17 x research source keep in mind that animals respond to you the way you treat them approach animals slowly animals are much more sensitive to behaviors and smells than humans no matter what type of animal horses cats dogs turtles or birds approach them slowly and quietly to avoid scaring them or causing them undue stress avoid approaching an animal from its blind spots which can startle it this may traumatize the animal or could wind up in an injury for you let dogs cats and other animals sniff you before you handle it extend your hand and let the animal smell you it will decide if you can approach it more closely from here consider washing your hands if you are touching multiple animals as some pets may not like the smell of another species give the animal a few seconds or minutes to approach you some animals may be naturally timid and need a little while to get used to your presence approaching them before an animal shows it wants your attention can cause it stress pick up your animal calmly if your pet approaches you for attention or you want give her some love by picking her up move calmly and slowly towards her if her body seems relaxed pick her up using correct methods to support her body and prevent harm place your hands under the animal s legs or on the legs and belly this provides a stable base so she feels safe you can also gently move your arms underneath your animal if she is larger remember to stay calm and be patient so that you don t startle your animal if the animal shows any signs of not wanting to be picked up allow it to go free and try again another time use proper methods for larger animals for example if you need to pick up a horse cow or a pig make sure you have the proper equipment such as a crane that supports the legs head and belly stand up slowly once you have a good handle of your pet this can minimize the risk of startling the animal and traumatizing it avoid picking up an animal by its head individual legs or tail no exceptions otherwise you can seriously harm and traumatize the animal hold your animal stably once you ve calmly picked up your animal make sure to assure her and help her relax by keeping a stable hold on her this can ensure that both of you have a relaxing and enjoying bonding experience keep your animal in a balanced position so that she feels safe avoid flipping animals which can not only traumatize but also harm them 18 x research source consider sitting down with your pet to help both of you relax this may allow the animal to snuggle into you and further establish your bond of trust make sure you talk to your pet and stroke her while you are holding her remember that wild animals are just that wild anyone who spends time in or near nature likely enjoys seeing the critters that inhabit unpopulated areas although animals like raccoons foxes and alligators are cute and may appear cuddly they live in the wild and exhibit behaviors of animals that aren t domesticated such as killing prey or things they perceive as threats 19 x research source be aware that many species of animals such as alligators cannot be tamed and you shouldn t make an attempt to tame them or their offspring 20 x research source be aware that it is often against the law to keep wild animals without a special permit 21 x research source enjoy wildlife from afar disturbing wildlife is one way to

only can this protect wildlife but also your pets take care when driving human development is increasingly encroaching on the habitats of wild animals housing area and roads interrupt the natural area of animals such as deer and foxes taking care when driving through areas populated by wild animals can show them kindness and consideration avoid swerving to not hit an animal on major roads this can lead to major accidents and even human fatalities do your best to not hit the animal never go out of your way to hit an animal with your car it s cruel and could get you in legal trouble if someone sees you respect wild meat the meat of wild animals like deer is in no question nutritious and beneficial for human consumption if you wish to take advantage of this as a natural alternative to the horrors of factory farming make sure you can be a responsible and respectful hunter strive to become proficient enough with a gun or bow so that the animal will drop to the ground as quickly and as

noises bright lights and strange smells,know when and where fireworks will be happening the loud noise of fireworks the flashing lights and the smell of sulfur are what scare pets most 1 x research source contact your local municipality to find out when your area is likely to have fireworks check that your pets id tags and microchips are up to date mark the calendar when renewal payments are due and be sure to make payments on time if your pet runs away during firework events it s much easier to be identified as its owner through a microchip 2 x research source mark the dates on a calendar so that you can keep track of when to ensure your pets are cared for expose your pet to loud noises and firework sounds gradually desensitization of loud noises can help to prevent your pet from getting scared during the fireworks start by playing soft music or fireworks sounds for your pet a few weeks before the fireworks then gradually increase the sound of the music or fireworks each day until you are playing it at a loud volume offer petting praise and treats to your pet for keeping calm 3 x research source playing loud noises after the fireworks can help to desensitize it further by showing it that what it just experienced is not scary turn the lights on and try to insulate the house as best you can keeping the lights on will calm your pet and make it feel more secure close the curtains in the room and if your animal is in a cage cover up the cage with a thick blanket which will hide it from flashing lights and dampen loud noises in a stable keep the lights on and keep the doors

some common noises that can soothe your pet 4 x research source provide a hiding place for your pets this will allow your pets somewhere safe that they can retreat to during the fireworks to feel safe try placing a heavy blanket over a crate or pet carrier or lay a box on its side and place a folded up blanket or towel inside of it 5 x research source find a central room away from windows to contain your pets a room that has no windows located in the middle of your home is ideal as it naturally dampens outside noises it should be a room you can close off to stop your pet from running about the house and creating a mess make sure your outdoor animals are locked in their pen and consider moving them to a more central pen in your barn or stable to keep them away from doors and windows if you have more than one pet be sure they don t mind being confined in the same room or select several rooms for different pets for example dogs and cats will usually appreciate being separated if you must separate animals make a second room as insulated as you can and keep the most anxious animal in the central room and stay with and comfort the animal in the second room try using

medication between your dog s gums and cheek using a needleless syringe 8 x research source make the rooms your pets will be confined in feel familiar put down familiar clean bedding and something that smells of you such as a t shirt you ve worn give them their favorite chew toys scratch pads balls or other toys to keep your pets distracted 9 x research source ensure that the room temperature is comfortable make it warm in cold weather or cool in hot weather provide food and water for your pet be sure to leave sufficient water and food for your pet in the confinement space if your pet has access to water and its regular food it will be calmer consider buying a special treat such as wet food or small sausages to make it feel more comfortable during the fireworks chewing can help to relieve stress for dogs that like to chew make sure that your dog has an appropriate chew toy or bone if it likes to chew to calm itself move your pet to the prepared room if you re worried about not being able to find your pet consider looking for it a few hours before the fireworks are set to start mealtime is a good time to round up your pets if your dog needs a walk be sure to walk it before confining it in the room even if your pet is caged you should still keep it in the secure and comfortable room you ve selected if your pet is a horse or other farm animal make sure it has clean bedding and is safely inside the stable or barn prepare yourself mentally and try to relax it s possible to transfer some of your anxiety and worry to your pet so it s important to remain calm so you don t inadvertently stress your pet out if you ve prepared properly in advance there is no need to feel worried as you have done all you can to make the experience as easy as possible for it stay with your pet or at least check on it regularly comfort it and talk to it be friendly and stay happy and upbeat as pets can read emotions better than you think if it s not possible to stay with it you may be at the fireworks display yourself just make sure you do everything you can for its comfort while you are gone act how you normally would when you visit your pet treating it any differently than you normally do may make it feel more anxious allow your pet to hide somewhere in the room it s common for pets to cope with these experiences by using a bolthole and dragging it out of its safe space can make him much more anxious consider using lavender plants or spray for a calming scent gently bruise the flowers of fresh lavender and make sure that it s out of reach of your pet especially if you have a cat you should use a pheromone spray designed for cats and small rodents as these animals can be harmed by the strong fumes reassure your pet and make the home normal again be sure that the fireworks are over before you remove sound and light dampening blankets and curtains let your pet have a free run of the house to see how it behaves before letting it go back outside put your animal s cage back in its normal place and stay with them for a few hours to see how they are coping sometimes it is best to wait until the following morning to let your pet back outdoors do a yard sweep before letting your pets back outside collect any sparklers firecrackers and other party items and broken objects even if you did not host a party at your house it is still a good idea to check for litter that may have entered your yard from nearby celebrations 10 x research source check for signs of stress in your pet some pets will return to normal as soon as the loud noises and flashing lights stop but some may need special attention to feel safe again watch for irregular behaviour from your pet which could be a sign that it s having a hard time re adjusting in cats signs of stress include running away soiling the house hiding and refusing to eat in dogs signs of stress include anxious barking running away soiling the house cowering clinging to their owner whimpering trembling pacing and refusing to eat in small rodents signs of stress include hiding staying silent excessive tooth grinding and acting more aggressively than usual in horses and stable animals signs of stress include soiling themselves refusing to eat sweating and tooth grinding make your pet feel at home again and give it lots of attention after taking down blankets moving its cage back and making the home feel as it did before the fireworks you can make your pet feel much more comfortable and relaxed even if it was scared during the fireworks if it seems stressed be sure to give it lots of attention and reassure it through gentle grooming and talking in a soft voice,Pets-and-Animals

materials they are often marked by a series of green arrows forming a circle you may also find information on a product s label indicating how much of it is made from recycled materials 2 x research source if you wear make up be conscious of which products you purchase many cosmetics companies are notorious for animal testing and other environmentally harmful practices a lot of big companies like olay and garnier routinely practice animal testing read the labels on cosmetics shampoos and conditioners to make sure there is no animal testing involved 3 x research source many products make use of palm tree oil it s used in foods cosmetics and soaps many tropical forests are being stripped to make room for palm tree farms if you see palm tree oil on the label of a product you re buying make sure that the company harvests the oil in a sustainable manner you can find a list of companies that support ethical palm oil harvesting on the union of concerned scientists website 4 x research source do not buy products made from endangered species you should never purchase products made from threatened or endangered species many people enjoy bringing home memorable souvenirs after overseas trips however many of these trinkets are made from animals in danger of extinction avoid products made form things like ivory tortoiseshell and coral you should also stay away from anything made from

help by transiting into a more plant based diet 10 x research source a vegetarian diet means you refrain from eating products made from animal flesh products like eggs butter and cheese are still acceptable in a vegetarian diet but you would exclude anything like chicken or beef protein in a vegetarian diet can come from nuts legumes eggs and cheese 11 x research source a vegan diet excludes any products made from animals including cheese and eggs many people choose to go vegan because farming practices that harvest meatless animal based products still greatly harm the environment as a vegan you would get your protein solely from plant based options like beans nuts and seeds 12 x research source you should talk to your doctor before switching to a vegetarian or vegan diet vegans especially may have to take certain vitamins to make sure they get the necessary nutrients when not ingesting animal based products if animal protein is an important part of your balanced diet

environment if going vegetarian or vegan seems like a massive commitment consider simply lessening the overall amount of meat you eat in addition to helping the environment eating less meat is good for your overall health 13 x research source you can have one or two nights a week when you try to make a vegan or vegetarian based dinner you could also try something like only eating meat for one meal per day recycle and buy sustainable products you should make an effort to recycle products like cans cardboards and plastics you should also try to switch over to reusable products go for cloth napkins over paper ones for example and do not buy products made from materials that are not biodegradable give your time to nature the best way to help endangered species is to protect the environments where they live give your time to nature by visiting or volunteering at a local wildlife refuge such organizations always need donations and volunteers as they often lack adequate funding

a candidate that has consistently supported bettering your country s environmental practices 19 x research source overpopulation of humans is a major cause of environmental decay therefore look for candidates who support education and healthcare for women throughout the world women who have access to things like birth control are less likely to have an unexpected or unwanted pregnancy providing education and healthcare to women worldwide can curb overpopulation and help the environment 20 x research source join an organization you can also become politically involved by joining an organization dedicated to animal rights and welfare greenpeace peta and the national wildlife foundation are a few organizations that strive to mobilize politically to protect endangered species you can help an organization by simply becoming a member donating a small fee once a year however you can also volunteer your time and services if you want to help endangered species look into helping through direct action look up local branches of organizations dedicated to animal rights and welfare see what opportunities there are to get involved use social media to your advantage knowledge can be an incredibly powerful tool when it comes to helping endangered species use social media to educate your friends and family members if people understand the necessity of immediate action they may be more likely to help post relevant articles on social media websites you should both news stories that talk about abstract facts and lists that give people specific instructions on how to help for example you could post a list of small changes you can take to reduce your carbon footprint you could also post recipes and articles and how to makes your favorite foods vegetarian or vegan encourage people to sign petitions online petitions do not often result in direct action right away but they can help raise awareness of an issue if politicians other leaders and corporations see many people care about something they may give it more attention encourage people to call their congressperson when a vote is coming up regarding laws about animal welfare and sustainable environmental practices if enough people call in expressing concern you could have a real impact on how your representative votes talk to your friends and family members express your concerns to others education can be a powerful tool when it comes to social change you do not need to be preachy or get insulting with people however you can kindly suggest small changes when the opportunity comes up for example propose you and co workers carpool to work mention what a positive impact this might have on the environment 21 x research source volunteer for organizations that help raise public awareness volunteering your time to organizations in need is one of the best ways to help educate the public some of the organizations listed above often do public awareness campaigns you can see if you can donate your time to

how to grow black soldier flies,black soldier flies hermetia illucens are unique bugs that can be a big help on any farm they love decaying things so don t throw your compost away if you see sleek wasp like flies or fat white grubs on it instead turn them into a food source for animals like chickens and fish black soldier flies are very easy to raise and are completely harmless to humans they live almost anywhere but grow particularly well in moderately warm areas like most of the u s and europe with the right setup you can have a protein packed sustainable food source at home 1 x research source,purchase a plastic tub and other building supplies get a storage tote like what you might keep clothes in under your bed it doesn t have to have a lid but make sure it holds at least 20 us gal 76 l it should be big enough to hold all of the waste you plan on using you will also have to get a few other supplies including pvc pipes to set up your fly farm 2 x research source buy 2 pvc pipes that are 2 in 5 1 cm wide and 10 ft 3 0 m long get 2 90 degree pvc elbow joints elbow joints are small connectors that fit on ends of other pvc pipes find a 5 us gal 19 l collection bucket to hold the soldier fly larvae most of the supplies are available online and at hardware stores you can get plastic totes from general retailers too put on a dust mask safety glasses and gloves before working you won t have to do a ton of heavy lifting to set up your farm but there is still a little bit of assembly required whenever you re cutting parts for the tank put on the dust mask and glasses you will definitely benefit from having a pair of cut resistant gloves at well pvc pipe releases irritating dust when it s cut but it can also have sharp edges you might overlook 3 x research source if possible plan on assembling the tank outdoors or at least in a ventilated space like a garage that way you can limit how much of the dust ends up in your home keep other people and pets away from the area until you re done working and have had a chance to clean up use a hacksaw to trim 6 ft 1 8 m off the pipes measure out from one end of each pipe and mark the spot with a pencil if you have a vise available use it to hold the pipes in place it will help you get a smoother more accurate cut while holding the pipes still firmly saw through them each pipe will be around 4 ft 1 2 m long 4 x research source you could use other tools if you don t have a hacksaw available try using a pipe cutter for instance or a miter saw if you get your pvc pipes from a hardware store ask the employees for help some stores will cut the pipes for you as long as you know what lengths you need mark spots to drill into one of the shorter sides of the tank to set up the fly tank as easily as possible plan on drilling through one of the tub s smaller ends make the spots about 1 in 2 5 cm from the sides of the tub they should also be about 3 in 7 6 cm from the top 5 x research source the exact positioning of the holes doesn t matter all that much the main thing is to ensure the pvc pipes fit through them resting comfortably on the bedding you add later drill holes through the marked spots with a 2 in 5 1 cm wide drill bit if you have a drill bit that big fit it on the end of a power drill break through the plastic to create a pair of holes just big enough for the pvc pipes to slide through test the holes by pushing the pvc pipes through them 6 x research source if you don t have the right size drill bit use a smaller one drill through the center of each mark then gradually widen it until they are big enough to fit the pipes saw the top halves off of the pvc pipes measure 6 in 15 cm from the end of each pipe and put a pencil mark there this time cut across the width of the pipe remove the top half of both pipes the remaining length of pipe will be a little ramp for your black soldier flies to explore later 7 x research source remember to cut the pipe in half rather than removing another 6 in 15 cm off the pipe s length otherwise the pipes might be too short for the fly farm to work as intended fit the elbow joints on the end of the long pipes slide the long pipes through the holes you drilled first position them so the ends you cut in half are inside the tub then push the 90 degree elbow joints firmly onto the opposite end of each pipe rotate them so they face one another 8 x research source you won t have to use pvc glue the pipes will hold unless you pull them apart if you wish to have a little additional security spread some glue over the ends before sticking them together connect the 4 ft 1 2 m pipes to the elbow joints use the remaining length of pvc you cut in the beginning slide them into the open ends of the elbow joints then firmly twist them clockwise to lock them in place if you wish to use pvc glue to hold them together apply the glue to the ends of both the pipes and elbow joints before securing them together 9 x research source position a plastic bucket underneath the pipes behind the tub grab a 5 us gal 19 l paint bucket for instance and set it near the pipes make sure the open ends of the pipes are both turned toward the bucket they should be over the bucket when the black soldier flies hatch they will crawl up the pipes and eventually end up in your bucket 10 x research source the collection bucket makes getting the flies much easier if the fly larvae can t escape the plastic tub you would have to dig for them and risk messing up your fly farm it s best to have a couple of plastic buckets to change in and out as you collect the larva fill the tub about 3 in 7 6 cm deep with organic compost purchase a big bag of gardening compost or an organic soil mix from your local gardening center pour it in and spread it out consistently across the tub make sure the pvc ramps are above the compost this will be the base for your new black flies 11 x research source kitchen compost is also safe to use if you have it available if you just need a base to get your fly farm started store bought compost is easy to find black flies love compost but you can t let the layer get too deep they dig about 3 in 7 6 cm deep naturally and they don t grow as well if they go much deeper than that you could also use other organic material to create the base for example you might use partially rotted sawdust and homemade charcoal dampen rolled oats in a plastic bucket to use as fly food pour about 1 lb 0 45 kg of oats into the bucket mix in about 10 cups 2 4 l of water and leave the oats to soak for at least 3 hours when the oats are moist and juicy without any extra water at the bottom of the bucket pour them into your tub and spread them out in an even layer keep the pvc tubes above them 12 x research source to find big bags of oats check out a farm supply store online or in person you can often get 20 lb 9 1 kg bags for less than 20 usd oats are a great inexpensive way to keep your flies fed you could also mix the oats with compost in smaller plastic bins so they don t end up in the rest of the tub the smaller tubs are easier to deal with if you need to clean them out try misting the mixture with water so you don t have to soak it place vegetables and other organic scraps on top of the soil add some extra food to give flies more of an incentive to live in the home you re building get things like leftover carrots cucumber and watermelon cut it all up into small chunks roughly 1 in 2 5 cm thick then throw it on top of the oats scatter the vegetables out across the tub 13 x research source black soldier flies eat all sorts of organic material they don t eat lots of animal fat or protein so stick to things like manure grain fruits and vegetables coffee grounds are fine to use in your grub tub the caffeine even makes them grow faster however they can t survive off of coffee grounds alone so make sure you have plenty of other types of food in there as well order black soldier fly larvae to get your farm started the quickest way to get your grub tub up and running is by ordering live larvae online you can get a container of 100 live bugs for about 8 and that will be more than enough to start if you re patient you could also attract adult flies to come lay eggs in the tub the eggs will eventually hatch into larvae grow and then lay more eggs 14 x research source black soldier flies are also known as phoenix worms if you see phoenix worms for sale you are getting the right bug by buying them make sure you know when mail order larvae will arrive they have to be sent when the weather is around 40 to 80 f 4 to 27 c or else they won t survive however you usually receive them in the mail after a few days expect to have to wait 2 to 3 weeks for wild black soldier flies to start spreading throughout your tub they are attracted to rotting things so you could use corn kernels fermented in water or sour milk to help draw them in black soldier fly larvae have a dull white color and are about 1 in 2 5 cm long and 1 4 in 0 64 cm wide adult flies are thin and about 25 32 in 2 0 cm long so they are usually bigger than other pesky flies you might see around compost 15 x research source pour the fly larvae out on top of the food in the bin pull the lid off of the container if the larvae reached your home in one piece you will see them squirming around lower the container down close to the compost and oat mix then slowly tip it over to get the larvae out spread them out as much as you can across the food but don t worry if they are bunched up 16 x research source adding the larvae to the bin is really easy but you might want to put on a pair of gloves if you re not fond of bugs place corrugated cardboard in the tub to hold fly eggs black soldier flies prefer laying eggs in hidden spots instead of directly on food trim a piece of cardboard about 3 in 7 6 cm wide the length can be whatever you want it to be but try starting with a piece 3 in 7 6 cm long as well set it on top of the compost at one end of the tub 17 x research source corrugated cardboard is a special type of cardboard it is made up of 2 outer layers and a ruffled inner layer that leaves plenty of space for black soldier fly eggs to make your grub tub even better attach small pieces of cardboard to its sides you can cut 3 in 7 6 cm strips then secure them to the rim with rubber bands pins or another alternative the cardboard lasts at least for 1 year you will be able to see the eggs which look like white fuzz when the holes are full of that fuzz replace the cardboard place the tub under an overhanging roof north of your home find a stable spot for your tub that is relatively protected from the elements black soldier flies still need light but they shouldn t be in direct sunlight keep the tub in a relatively shady area where it won t get rained on if that isn t an option find another spot with an overhanging roof you could put the tub under trees or even inside a shed 18 x research source the northern side of your home is ideal since it gets hit with less rain and sunlight but it isn t an option for everyone moisture usually won t destroy your farm but it causes the larvae to crawl toward dry ground if you re worried about it you could cover the tub with a lid or move it into a dry spot when you see rain in the forecast to help outdoor farms survive some people make a habitat with a wire mesh bottom it helps drain water so the flies don t get washed out leave the tub in an outdoor area around 80 f 27 c that is when they eat and grow the fastest however black soldier flies are pretty tough and will grow when the temperature is from 32 to 113 f 0 to 45 c they become inactive when the temperature falls below 50 f 10 c it won t be a problem in the spring and summer but your farm stock may die off when colder weather rolls around 19 x research source because of the temperature your best bet is to start your farm in the spring after the frost has passed when the temperature falls too low in fall don t expect to see any new larvae if you live in an area that gets super cold part of the year don t worry just attract new flies to your farm when the weather warms up again if you re interested in growing flies year round move your tub indoors you will have to have fluorescent or led lighting to mimic sunlight unless you can place the tub near a window or skylight indoor fly habitats have to have mesh netting around them or else you will end up with a lot of flies fluttering around your home maintain the humidity level so it s around 70 get a hygrometer and stick it or hang it near the top of your tub hygrometers measure humidity or the amount of water in the air the easiest way to maintain the humidity is by keeping the compost moist when you add something like wet rolled oats it boosts the humidity level 20 x research source the compost at the bottom of the tank has to be moist but not soggy if it gets a little dry mist it with water getting a fly habitat to 70 humidity is tough but fortunately you don t have to do too much if your tub is outdoors the flies will be fine as long as the humidity is from 30 to 90 if your tub is indoors you will have to pay more attention to the humidity make sure it stays above 30 such as by adding damp compost or by misting the tub place plants near the tub to encourage flies to lay eggs if your tub is outdoors you probably won t need to worry about having plants around as long as there are plants within sight of the tub the adult flies will find them if you really don t have any plants in the area you could get a potted plant and place it nearby black soldier flies like all kinds of leafy plants especially daisies and carrots 21 x research source trick your flies you don t actually have to have a real potted plant get a fake plant instead and set it close to the tub they won t know the difference if you re running an indoor tank you have to have a plant in order to get the flies to continue laying eggs add new wet food to the tank about once a week soak more rolled oats or another type of food in water before spreading it out across the tub s floor a layer about 1 in 2 5 cm thick is fine most of the time mix up more food each time you notice the supply running low the soldier flies need it to continue growing and laying eggs 22 x research source the food is the main thing that keeps flies in your tub it brings in adult flies but the larvae get water from what they eat they don t drink water like animals do mix in table scraps with the food to make the habitat even better save organic material like coffee grounds vegetables manure and even eggshells to keep your tub s compost rich with nutrients gather the larvae in the collection bucket at least once a week it s better to check the bucket every day if you can set aside the time to do so the larvae eat for up to a week before crawling toward dry ground you can remove the collection bucket to carry the larvae to where you plan on using them you could also put on a glove and pick them up by hand or scoop them up with a shovel to transfer them to another container 23 x research source take the larvae out of the collection bucket to use right away such as by feeding them to chicken or fish they could also be left out in sunlight for 2 or 3 days to dry out and then frozen for long term storage any larvae you don t collect could grow into new flies if you re trying to maintain a farm especially indoors keep some of them to get more larvae if you re outdoors you can often attract wild flies and can collect all of the larvae,Pets-and-Animals
how to clean a horse shoe,if you come across an old horseshoe at an antique store or in a field somewhere chances are it s going to look a little rusty and worn thankfully a coat of rust doesn t mean that the horseshoe has reached the end of its life with some time and elbow grease you can revive it and get it gleaming so you can display it as a decoration or even use it to play horseshoes if you re working with horse shoe that is on a horse check out this article on how to clean a horse s hoof,brush away any loose dirt and grime with an old toothbrush make sure to get into all the cracks and crevices you may even want to use a small pick to dislodge dirt from the grooves of the horseshoe if it s caked in 1 x research source if you don t have a toothbrush use a scrub brush you may want to wear gloves during this process depending on where you found the horseshoe or what condition it s in there might be some poop or other things you don t want to get on your hands rub away surface rust with a steel wool pad small flakes of rust will come away with just a little bit of elbow grease which will make the rest of the cleaning process a bit easier just grab the steel wool and scrub the entire horseshoe with it until there s no more rust coming away 2 x research source if you don t have steel wool you could also use sandpaper or a wire brush this process also helps remove more dirt if any is left on the horseshoe remove nails that are sticking out of the horseshoe with a pair of pliers sometimes you might find a horseshoe that still has nails or bits of metal coming out of it if you want to use the horseshoe for games or decoration you ll need to remove these you should be able to grasp the end of the nail with a pair of pliers and wiggle it loose 3 x research source make sure to discard of the nails you don t want to drop one and accidentally step on it later if the nails are too hard to remove wait until after you ve treated the horseshoe for rust and then try again they should be looser at that stage remove light rust by soaking the horseshoe in white vinegar for 24 hours place the horseshoe in a plastic container add enough white vinegar so that the horseshoe is completely covered let it sit for 24 hours then take it out and scrub it down with a steel wool pad or scrub brush 4 x research source if the rust is particularly bad you may need to soak the horseshoe in white vinegar a second time use lemon juice and salt for an all natural way to remove stubborn rust place the horseshoe in a clean plastic container and sprinkle it with about 1 2 cup 150 grams of white table salt pour lemon juice fresh or bottled over the horseshoe so that it s completely saturated let it sit for 2 3 hours then scrub the horseshoe with a steel wool pad repeat the salt and lemon process on the other side of the horseshoe 5 x research source you could also try scrubbing the horseshoe with the lemon rind this process should take about 3 hours in all but you can repeat it 2 or 3 times if needed soak a heavily rusted horseshoe in citric acid for a more abrasive treatment in a plastic container mix 2 cups 470 ml of hot water and 6 tablespoons 120 grams of citric acid submerge the horseshoe and let the citric acid do its work over the next 12 hours or so in the morning rinse and scrub the horseshoe to remove the rest of the rust 6 x research source you can buy citric acid online or from a health food store some grocery stores carry it now too citric acid comes from citrus fruits it s naturally abrasive and is a chemical free compound that is safe to clean with opt for a commercial rust remover if the horseshoe is extremely rusty this is also an option if you tried another method but couldn t get all the rust off depending on what brand and type of rust remover you purchase it may take anywhere from 30 minutes to 24 hours for the chemicals to work look for a bottled product that you can pour into a container so the horseshoe can soak in it rather than a product in a spray bottle 7 x research source when working with chemical products remember to wear protective gear gloves protective eyewear and even a face mask can help keep you safe if possible work in a well ventilated area so you aren t breathing in dangerous fumes always read the directions and follow them carefully smooth and shine the horseshoe with an angle grinder an angle grinder is a type of power tool that you can use to grind away rough surfaces to reveal smooth metal underneath you ll need either a brush or sandpaper attachment after turning it on move the angle grinder back and forth over the surface of the horseshoe until the metal beneath is revealed 8 x research source wear safety goggles and thick gloves to protect your eyes and hands while you work if loud noises bother you you may also want to wear earplugs it may help to hold the horseshoe in a clamp so that you can use both hands on the grinder without worrying about the horseshoe slipping around use elbow grease and a piece of sandpaper if you don t have an angle grinder coarse sandpaper or 40 80 grit sandpaper should work well for this type of project to make things easier on your hand invest in a manual hand sander you may also want to use a sanding sponge to help you get around the curves of the horseshoe more easily 9 x research source rub the sandpaper back and forth over the horseshoe until you see the metal underneath peeking through you can buy hand sanders sanding sponges and sandpaper at your local hardware store rub a metal polish into the horseshoe if you want it to shine this may be particularly helpful if you re planning to use the horseshoe as a decorative accent each product is a little different but generally you ll apply a little bit of polish to a clean rag and rub or massage it into the metal until it gleams 10 x research source to get into all the cracks and crevices you could use a cotton swab dipped in polish wear gloves and clothes you don t mind getting dirty while you re doing this if you get the polish on your outfit it can be really hard to wash out coat the horseshoe with clear varnish to keep it from rusting again look for a clear spray on varnish or lacquer at your local hardware or art supplies store spray one side of the horseshoe let it dry and then spray the other side don t forget to get the sides of the horseshoe too 11 x research source if you prefer you could even spray paint the horseshoe a different color this could be cool if you re using the horseshoe to decorate,Pets-and-Animals
how to reduce chlorine in an aquarium,chlorine is added to tap water to kill off harmful pathogens but it s not something you want in your aquarium any trace of chlorine in the tank water can throw off the ph and oxygen levels and make your fish sick this goes for both freshwater and saltwater aquariums it s important to treat the water each time you change it and test it regularly to make sure you re adding the right amount testing and dechlorinating the water is easy to do and will ensure your fish stay healthy and happy,buy testing strips or a test tube kit online or from any pet store go to a pet store or shop online for an aquarium water test kit that measures the ph of the water and tests for chlorine ammonia nitrates nitrites and phosphates be sure to read the label to make sure the test addresses all of these contaminants 1 x research source some kits don t test for chlorine so if that s the case pay attention to the reading for ammonia if the water has any trace of ammonia over 0 ppm that s a sign there s chlorine in your water fill the test tube with water from your aquarium and add chlorine test drops dip the tube into your aquarium to collect enough water to come up to the designated fill line on the tube refer to the kit s instruction manual to see how many drops of chlorine testing solution you should use usually it s about 3 drops put the cap on the tube when you re done if you re testing for more than just chlorine do this for all of the test tubes 3 x research source if you re using test strips dip it in the water and then set the strip down on a level surface shake each tube for 30 60 seconds and set a timer for 5 minutes shake up each tube so the testing solution gets fully incorporated into the water set the tubes somewhere safe for 5 minutes so the solution can set into the water and give you the most accurate results 4 x research source if you re using test strips you ll only need to wait 30 seconds refer to the kit s instruction manual to see exactly long you should wait until the results are ready if you re testing for multiple things keep the tubes in the same order that they appear on the results guide so you can keep track of which is which match the color of the water in the chlorine testing tube to the results guide place the tube with the chlorine solution in it next to the results guide to see which color swatch matches the hue of the water make sure you re reading the result for the right type of water in your tank freshwater or saltwater if you re testing for multiple contaminants or just the general ph and hardness of the water be sure to align the correct tube with the corresponding swatches 5 x research source the optimal levels for your fish tank are as follows ph 6 8 7 6 ammonia 0 ppm chlorine 0 ppm nitrites 0 ppm nitrates 20 40 ppm phosphates 0 02 ppm hardness 5 12 dh degrees alkalinity 7 12 dkh remove 50 of the water from the tank if you have a large tank use a cup to scoop out half of the water in the tank you can also use a gravel pump to suck the water out and into a nearby bucket be sure not to suck out any fish with it for smaller tanks you can simply lift it up and pour it out over the sink 6 x research source if you re pouring the water out over the sink be sure not to pour your fish out with it put a strainer or drain guard over the drain just in case in most cases it ll suffice to change out 50 of the water every 2 weeks but if you re changing all of the water make a temporary tank for your fish to do this fill a container with 64 fluid ounces 1 900 ml of water roughly the same temperature as the tank water and add 1 drop of water conditioner then use a net to add the fish add fresh tap water that s the same temperature as the remaining tank water stick a thermometer into the remaining tank water to see what temperature it is turn on the hose or faucet and make sure the water is roughly that same temperature use a hose bucket or faucet to slowly add the water pouring it in at one of the corners or sides so you don t stress out your fish or jostle any plants that are stationed in the gravel 7 x research source it s okay if the new water is 1 or 2 degrees off from the old water the ideal temperature for most tanks is between 76 f and 80 f 25 c and 27 c use 1 drop of liquid sodium thiosulfate for each gallon of water you ve added sodium thiosulfate is the most important thing you can do to get rid of chlorine in your tank water so be sure to add the appropriate amount for however much new water you ve added in most cases a single drop of the liquid is enough for 128 fluid ounces 3 800 ml so check your tank size and divide it by 2 if you re doing a 50 water change 9 x research source for instance if your tank holds 20 gallons 2560 liquid ounces or 75 708 ml you ll use 10 drops of sodium thiosulfate some types of conditioner recommend you use enough for all of the water in the tank even if you re only doing a 50 water change so read the instructions on the bottle if you re doing a full water change add 1 2 of the dose once the tank is halfway full add the final dosage once it s completely full you can buy sodium thiosulfate online or from pet stores or home improvement stores it s also used to clean carpets make your own water conditioner to keep on hand for future water changes place 500 g by weight of sodium thiosulfate flakes in a 128 fluid ounces 3 800 ml jug and fill it with water shake it up and use 1 drop of the mixture for each 1 gallon of water in the tank 10 x trustworthy source food and agricultural organization of the united nations specialized agency of the united nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition go to source for instance 0 03 fluid ounces 0 89 ml of mix will treat 1 280 fluid ounces 10 0 us gal this is a much more cost effective way to dechlorinate your water if you have large tanks or plan to keep fish for years to come fill the entire tank with tap water and wait for 2 3 days as an alternative if you re just starting your aquarium fill the tank with regular tap water and let it sit for 2 3 before you add the fish be sure to cover it loosely with a clean towel to keep pests and debris out of the water if you have a saltwater aquarium let the freshwater sit a few days before you add the marine salt 11 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source be sure to test the water before you add the fish if there are any traces of chlorine left add the appropriate amount of sodium thiosulfate keep in mind that if you re working with saltwater you ll need to wait 24 48 hours to add the fish after you add the salt use chlorine free bottled water or well water as alternatives if you have a smaller tank and don t mind the extra cost fill your tank with bottled water if you live near a clean water source like a pond or small private reservoir and have that piped into your home use that just be sure that any filters you use in your home don t chlorinate the water to kill off microorganisms 13 x research source if you do opt for well water be sure to test it every week with testing strips if you re going for the bottled water approach you may need to remineralize the water to maintain the proper ph some kinds of bottled water may also contain chlorine and other contaminants so be sure to test it regularly home carbon filtration systems like brita filters say they can remove chlorine and chloramine but some only get rid of the taste if you fill your tank with tap water you filter yourself always test it just in case examine your fish for overall paleness or red mucus coated gills healthy fish are vibrant in color and have clean gills so looking at them is often the best way to make sure they re happy and healthy if you notice these signs test the water right away and if necessary add sodium thiosulfate or change the water 14 x trustworthy source food and agricultural organization of the united nations specialized agency of the united nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition go to source removing a fish from the tank stresses them out which is not the best idea if you re already dealing with a sick fish address the water first and then take more drastic action later on if the fish still looks ill to remove the fish fill a small container with 64 fluid ounces 1 900 ml of water and add 1 drop of water conditioner use a net to put the fish into the separate tank while you get to work on changing the water in the aquarium notice if your fish are gasping for water at the top if your fish seem to be bobbing at the top of the water and gasping for air what s known as hypoxia chlorine could be messing up the amount of oxygen in the water to fix the problem change out half of the water and be sure to condition the new water you put in you can also add a powerhead air stones or an additional filter to increase the amount of oxygen in the water 15 x research source hypoxia can also be caused by too much nitrogen or phosphorus so be sure to test the water as soon as you notice this bobbing and gasping behavior pay attention to any erratic swimming or odd positioning if your fish are leaping out the water or spastically moving their tail fins or mouth take it as a sign that you need to change the water notice whether your fish are laying sideways in the tank as well 16 x trustworthy source food and agricultural organization of the united nations specialized agency of the united nations responsible for leading international efforts to end world hunger and improve nutrition go to source to help your fish recuperate feed them nutritious meals like frozen bloodworms or live blackworms add an airstone or sponge filter to your tank to help them get the oxygen they need sick fish are more likely to be picked on by other fish so if you notice one s getting bullied make sure they have some rock shelter so they can hide if that s not working you may need to put them in their own small tank until they make a full recovery,Pets-and-Animals

by 2 for instance 6 1 x 2 14 inches wide snub nosed dog breeds like pit bulls require bigger cages always choose the next size up for these breeds get a carrier with an accessible handle on the top if

ticket they will take the dog if it has to be in the cargo hold 26 x research source if you have a small dog or a service dog you get to keep them with you take the dog through security screening if

how to set up an axolotl tank,axolotls also known as ambystoma mexicanums are amphibians found in the lake of xochimilco near mexico city an axolotl life expectancy is of 10 15 years of age in captivity providing they are given adequate care it s essential to provide a suitable tank for your axolotl to thrive and grow this wikihow article will show you how,find a suitable tank axolotl s need plenty of room to grow as they generally reach a foot long in length a 20 gallon long is your best option if your axolotl is a baby in 1 5 in length if your axolotl is over 6 you will need to upgrade the tank to a 30 or 40 gallon axolotls prefer length to swim and not necessarily much depth to dive deeper or shallower long versions of tanks above a 20 gallon work best purchase the right equipment to set up an axolotl tank you will need a gravel vacuum thermometer and a sponge or bubble filter remember axolotls prefer a temperature between 60 64 f while you shouldn t use gravel in the tank due to ease of swallowing rocks you should purchase a gravel vacuum to sift through the sand and suck up any waste a sponge filter is best as they suck in particles to allow for the growth of beneficial bacteria while producing oxygenation and circulation to pick up most of the loose debris do not house your axolotl in a high flow area axolotls must not be in a high flow area because it will cause them stress and they will die they like to walk on the bottom of the tank with minimal current buy your axolotl accessories for their tank your axolotl will need sand to lay at the base of the tank and decorations such as rocks or caves sand of any colour that is safe for axolotls will be suitable rocks fake plants or plastic caves are a few examples of decorations you can plant in your axolotl tank if you are using rocks place the decorations in a pattern and provide caves for shade because of their sensitivity to light rocks can often times be stacked or staggered add water to the tank a water conditioner is a necessity due to the traces of chlorine in tap water which is toxic and will kill freshwater aquatic animals like axolotls the water conditioner eliminates chlorine through chemical reactions different products may have different instructions on how much to use when putting the conditioner in cycle the water before placing your axolotls inside cycling the water should be done to convert ammonia to nitrite to produce beneficial bacterial that will help maintain the fish economy a tank is cycled by first adding ammonia such as household ammonia and allowing the tank to run and build up beneficial bacteria in the filter and substrate the tank will be cycled once the water conditions level out and become consistent the ph of an axolotl tank should be anywhere from 6 5 to 8 but 7 4 to 7 6 is most ideal test the water quality even though the water may look clean the water quality could still be unsuitable for your axolotls to live in check the water quality periodically using a water tester kit compare the water to suitable charts to see if it is safe for your axolotls to live in the water pick out your axolotl there are different types of axolotls to choose from with five main types that are commonly sold this includes the wild legalistic white albino golden and melanoma there are more types of axolotls especially when crossbred do not house axolotls with other fish axolotls do not co exist peacefully with other fish because axolotls have very poor vision they will bite at any movement there is a great chance you axolotl will end up eating the fish in the tank for the fish and axolotl s safety it s best only to keep axolotls in the tank acclimate your axolotl when coming home from the store with your axolotl you should start by putting them in the water with the bag and allow them to acclimate for 15 30 minutes after the time is up you can safely open the bag and let your axolotls free in the tank it s important to allow your axolotls to transition instead of adding them straight to the tank otherwise you can put them into shock and cause fatality if the water temperatures are too far apart provide your axolotls with food axolotls are carnivores they like to eat frozen or dried bloodworms night crawlers and other insects feed your axolotl once every 1 2 days make sure you have a dish to drop their food into the tank to help your axolotls locate the food to prevent it from getting lost or wasted in the substrate monitor your axolotl in their tank each new axolotl parent should observe their tank every hour to ensure their axolotl is acclimating well to its new environment look for any behavioural changes to indicate something may be wrong observe your axolotl s eating habits as a declined appetite is usually the first sign of illness clean the tank frequently axolotls excrete quite often this waste has to be cleaned up to prevent build up as decomposition can cause ammonia and nitrate levels to spike clean your tank using a gravel vacuum even if you do not use gravel the vacuum helps keep the bottom of the tank clean and help with water changes a clean sponge can help clean any algae build

how to raise tadpoles,by raising and releasing tadpoles you not only get to witness a remarkable transformation but you also bring more frogs into the world frogs that will eat pesky bugs like gnats flies mosquitoes and more to keep them healthy and ensure that their metamorphosis goes smoothly you ll need to have the right set up and know how,find a suitable container to house the tadpoles tadpoles can be raised in most containers though it s best for them to be housed outside so that you attract more mosquitos to lay their larva for the tadpoles to eat nature provides a cleaner and more oxygenated atmosphere and because it s more natural be sure to keep them in the shade at all times though suitable containers include a large aquatic tank a large oven roast bowl a small pool if outside a tub lay a suitable base on the bottom of the housing use gravel to cover well add a big rock or two for shelter and land when the tadpoles transform 1 x research source put small weeds and grass with the roots attached to the water so the tadpoles can hang onto them and they eat the roots 2 x research source make sure there has not been a recent application of pesticides on any plant life added as this will kill the tadpoles within a day provide shade for about three quarters of the area if the tadpoles are outdoors the tadpoles must be able to get out of direct sunlight when they want to keep about 5 10 tadpoles per litre of water you can keep more but they may die out faster or become carnivorous keep the water clean tadpoles need clean dechlorinated water 3 x research source rainwater is one of the best waters to keep your tadpoles in since it contains mosquito larva and doesn t contain any chemicals some advise using water from where you found the tadpoles citation needed do not use tap water it s too full of chemicals that can harm tadpoles if you want to use tap water use water conditioner sold at pet stores for fish change the water regularly try to only change half the water at a time to keep the ph of the water balanced a turkey baster is good for this and disturbs the tadpoles as little as possible whilst making it easy to remove debris that gathers at the bottom of the container but this is optional not many tadpole frog owners have these boil romaine lettuce for 10 to 15 minutes it s ready when the leaves are soft and squishy drain and cut it into little pieces feed a pinch every day 4 x research source other types of lettuce should work too however only use softer leaves also all pieces should be small enough for their tiny mouths tadpoles can also be fed normal flake fish food but only in small pinches as it s not the absolute best for them a couple of pinches a week should keep the tadpoles hunger satisfied depending on the number of tadpoles you keep too much food can cause death to the tadpoles from over eating be patient they usually develop from egg to tadpole in 6 to 12 weeks 5 x research source keep that in mind and don t panic when it gets cold in winter the tadpoles will grow more slowly the ideal temperature is between 65 75 degrees fahrenheit or around 20 25 degrees celsius prepare for their metamorphosis when your tadpoles develop legs you will need a container with dirt for them to crawl up onto or they will drown do not feed the tadpoles when they have sprouted arms at this time the tadpole will be using its tail as food and it will become an adult frog 6 x research source provide more food after metamorphosis if you aren t releasing the froglets they will likely need larger housing be aware that many froglets dislike being handled the tank or housing for them must be kept clean daily otherwise bacteria will spread rapidly and can kill them,Pets-and-Animals
how to take care of frogs,frogs are cute little critters which make unusual and rewarding pets however there are many many species of frog out there each with its own specific care requirements use this article as a general guide to choosing and caring for a pet frog but be prepared to do more in depth research on the specific frog you choose,familiarize yourself with some good beginner breeds the first thing to realize when it comes to frogs is that there are a huge variety of frog species available some are easy to take care of while others will require a lot of time and specialist knowledge if this is your first pet frog it s highly recommended that you choose a suitable breed for beginners like one of the following african dwarf frog african dwarf frogs are a good option for beginners as they are small active and easy to take care of they don t require live food and are complete aquatic oriental fire bellied toads these frogs are a good option for beginners who want a terrestrial non aquatic frog they are fairly active and don t grow too large white s tree frog white s tree frog is perhaps the easiest tree frog to take care of they are somewhat active easy to feed and even tolerate being handled from time to time which is unusual for frogs pacman frogs pacman frogs are large terrestrial frogs which are easy to care for they tend to be quite sedentary which lowers their space requirements but may make them a boring pet for kids as a beginner you should avoid poison frogs or frogs that cost a lot of money poison frogs tend to be quite fragile and have complicated care needs while more expensive frogs are a risky choice for people new to frog care it s better to start with an inexpensive easy breed and work your way up avoid keeping wild frogs as pets although it is possible to catch wild frogs to keep as pets there are several things you should consider first firstly it can be difficult to identify what species of frog you have caught different species of frogs have very different requirements in terms of foods temperature and habitat so if you try to keep a wild frog in the wrong conditions it could die if you do decide to take a frog from the wild make sure to take note of the surroundings in which you find it was it hopping around a leafy grassy forest bed hiding under a rock or swimming in a pond these are the conditions you will most likely need to replicate at home however you should still try to find out the exact species of your frog by searching for images online consulting a frog book or asking a local nature expert this will help you to identify the frog s exact requirements secondly many of the frog species found in the wild are facing population declines or even extinction taking a frog from its natural environment could be harming wild frog populations especially if it is an endangered species thirdly sometimes wild frogs can carry diseases make sure yours is an active and healthy individual in fact taking protected species from the wild is illegal in some areas so be sure to check your state country regulations before capturing a wild frog consider the frog s size and space requirements the size of your frog when it s fully grown and the size of the tank it requires should be a top consideration when choosing your pet frog sometimes the teeny tiniest looking frogs in the pet store will become giant monster frogs when fully grown for example pixie frogs whose name would suggest a miniature frog start out measuring under an inch in length but can grow to a length of over eight inches large frogs require a lot of space for example a fully grown bullfrog will require a 75 gallon 283 9 l tank or larger if they are housed in undersized tanks these frogs can become unhappy and sick large tanks take up a lot of space in the home and require more effort to keep clean these frogs will also eat more food making them more expensive to feed than smaller frog varieties this is another reason to do your research and find out the exact breed of frog before you buy consider the frog s feeding requirements before you jump headfirst into buying the cutest or ugliest depending on your preference frog in the store you should take some time to figure out what it eats most frog species are happy to eat crickets worms such and red wigglers and night crawlers and other creepy crawlies however it s important to keep in mind that frogs usually prefer live food especially if you re squeamish about that sort of thing larger frogs will often require more substantial food which might include mice goldfish or guppies providing your frog with these items can be a lot of work and is not for the faint of heart in addition you will need to consider where the frog s food will come from your local grocery store probably doesn t stock live crickets do you have a large pet supply store nearby which caters for more exotic animals of course it is possible to find food for your frog in the back garden but this can be pretty time consuming and unreliable in addition garden pests are often exposed to chemical insecticides which is unhealthy for your frog find out how active your species is another major consideration is the activity level of your preferred species of frog this is especially important if the frog is a children s pet as most kids want a pet who ll keep them entertained a lot of the larger cool or weird looking frogs are a popular choice among beginner frog keepers however these frogs tend to be the least active and will simply sit still as a statue and sleep all day this can become boring very quickly if you re looking for a more active frog you re better off going for smaller frogs aquatic frogs and certain species of tree frog as these will often hop or swim around making them more fun to look at you should also bear in mind that even the most active frogs won t do much other than hop around or eat some crickets you can t take a frog for a walk teach it tricks or even handle it all that much therefore it s important to consider whether a frog is really the ideal pet for you or your child understand that keeping a pet frog is a commitment it s important to realize that getting a pet frog is not the same level of the time commitment as a goldfish in fact a large well cared for frog can live up to 25 years as a result you need to be prepared to take care of your frog for many years to come to feed it keep its environment clean and care for it when it s sick you should also think about how you will deal with future vacations as someone will need to care for your frog while you are away a willing volunteer can be difficult to find if your frog only eats live crickets or even mice if you get a pet frog but discover it s too much work or too much of an expense to keep you will have to get rid of it through the proper channels if you picked a wild frog from your backyard or a local park you should be able to release it in the same place you found it be specific and replace the frog as close to the original location as possible whether it was underneath leaves on the forest floor or beside a stream however if your frog is a store bought non native species you will not be able to release it into to wild you will need to give the frog back to the pet store sell the frog to a new owner donate the frog to a local school as a class pet or contact a nearby animal care organization figure out whether you need a license in some places you are required to possess a license to keep certain frogs as pets especially if they are endangered or poisonous for example the african clawed frog is illegal in states like california and oregon where it would pose a threat to native wildlife populations if released contact your local government office for more information on the licensing requirements in your area find out what type of tank your frog needs different species of frog have very different requirements when it comes to tanks so make sure you do your homework before buying terrestrial tanks these are the simplest frog tanks but should only be used for frog species that come from dry environments aquatic tank this type of tank is only used for purely aquatic species of the frog it is basically an aquarium filled with water just like a fish tank half and half this is the most common type of frog tank where half of the tank is filled with water while the other half is dry most frogs will do well in this environment arboreal tank the arboreal tank is designed specifically for tree frogs who prefer to spend their time climbing on branches these tanks are typically taller and narrower than other types of tank pond in some situations you can keep native frog species in a pond in your backyard sometimes simply building a pond will attract local frogs to your yard and you won t need to go to the trouble of catching them at all however you should never keep non native species in an outdoor pond as they might disrupt the local ecosystem by feeding on native frogs and other endangered insects place the tank in a suitable location once you have the tank you will need to decide where to put it it should be kept out of direct sunlight at all times as this can raise the temperature making it uncomfortable and perhaps dangerously dry and hot inside the tank the tank should also be kept away from the kitchen as smoke and other fumes from cooking can be harmful to your frog you also need to be careful not to expose the tank to any aerosol sprays such as spray paint in the garage or hair spray in the bedroom as these can be absorbed through the frog s skin potentially making him ill fill the tank with the right substrate materials the substrate is the material used to cover the bottom of the tank your main considerations when it comes to the substrate are how damp or dry the tank needs to be and how easy the material is to clean gravel stones are a good option for most common frog species the gravel is easy to clean and comes in a variety of colors and sizes other good options include potting soil pine bark sand and cedar or pine shavings once the substrate materials are in place you can set about decorating the inside of the tank to your frog s liking you can cover gravel substrate with a layer of moss which makes the tank look a lot more natural just make sure to keep the moss damp by spritzing it with clean stale water every so often and remember to keep an eye out for mold placing a few rocks or stones inside the tank is also a good option as it gives your frog something to climb on just make sure that the rocks have no sharp edges that the frog could injure itself on you can also decorate your tank with plastic branches or small live plants while a hollow log provides a good hiding spot buy or make a colorful background for your tank such as a rainforest backdrop as this helps to keep your frog feeling at home figure out your frog s light and temperature requirements the temperature and heating requirements for frogs vary greatly by species so make sure to do some research before you set up your tank unlike lizards snakes and turtles most frogs do not require any special lighting as they get all of their vitamin d requirements through their food however you will usually need to provide a light source for up to 12 hours a day especially if the tank doesn t have access to natural light fluorescent lighting is the safest option for frogs as it doesn t tend to get too hot hot lights can be dangerous if the frog decides to jump on them in terms of heating the ideal temperature for your frog will depend entirely on species the easiest way to change the temperature inside the tank is to change the temperature in the whole room alternatively you can buy heating lamps which go above rather than inside the tank or heating pads which wrap around the outside of the tank to raise the temperature inside if you need to heat the water in an aquatic or half and half tank you will need to purchase a glass tube or fully submersible water heater make sure to run any heaters a couple of days before you put the frogs in the tank this allows you to monitor the temperature and makes sure it is right for the frogs feed your frog crickets and other creepy crawlies as mentioned above most common frog species will eat crickets worms and other insects while larger frogs will also eat mice or goldfish as an occasional treat how much and how often you need to feed your frog will depend on the individual frog and may come down to a process of trial and error at first try feeding your frog three crickets per day to start off if he quickly eats all three and starts to look hungry over the next few days you can increase the number of crickets however if he only eats one or two and ignores the rest you may be able to cut back you can also experiment with different types of food such as mealworms waxworms and grasshoppers to see what your frog prefers aquatic frogs will generally eat frozen bloodworms or brine shrimp keep your frog clean and hydrated it is very important to provide your pet frog with clean water daily as he will use it for both drinking and bathing frogs absorb water through their skin rather than drinking with their mouths as a result they tend to spend long periods of time just sitting in their water baths or ponds this water should be dechlorinated if possible you will also need to clean out the tank every couple of days to remove any droppings wipe down the side of the tank check for mold or algae and generally maintain a healthy environment for your frog avoid handling your frog frogs don t like to be handled plain and simple therefore you should try to leave your frog inside the tank as much as possible and content yourself with just looking at him if you can t resist picking him up make sure to thoroughly wash and dry your hands first and avoid putting on any lotions as frogs can absorb these things from your skin and potentially fall ill be aware that he might squirm when you pick him up and potentially wet on you this is a sign that your frog is stressed by the handling and you should put him back in his tank as soon as possible also be very careful not to drop your frog while handling even if it squirms as falling from a height could seriously injure your frog pay attention to the health of your frog once a frog gets sick it can be very difficult to treat and the prognosis is rarely good therefore the best way to keep your frog healthy is to prevent it from becoming sick in the first place if your frog starts to look in any way skinny or malnourished ask yourself whether you are providing enough variety in terms of food a frog can t survive on a diet of crickets or mealworms alone one of most common frog deficiencies is a lack of calcium so consider sprinkling your frog s food with a powdered calcium supplement before feeding time watch out for signs of red leg which is a potentially fatal illness that commonly affects captive frogs red leg manifests as a reddening of the skin on the underside of the frog s legs and belly while suffering frogs tend to become lazy and pathetic if you suspect your frog might have red leg you should scrub out the tank to remove the parasite then give your frog daily sulfamethazine baths over a two week period you also need to look out for fungal infections and illnesses like dropsy and spring disease in these cases you probably need to seek treatment from a veterinarian who can prescribe an appropriate antibiotic for your frog,Pets-and-Animals
how to tell the difference between a frog and a toad,frogs and toads may seem similar but they are quite different there are many physical differences such as differences in skin color and body type there are also differences in behavior a frog will need to be in close proximity to a body of water for instance while a toad can be further away frogs also tend to hop higher than toads with some attention to detail you should be able to tell a toad from a frog,look at the hind legs you can tell the difference between a frog and a toad by the length of its legs if you can get close enough get a good look at the back legs specifically 1 x research source a frog s hind legs are very long as frogs hop more frequently than toads a frog s hind legs will be bigger than its head and body a toad s hind legs will be smaller as toads tend to crawl their hind legs will be shorter than their heads and bodies examine the feet frogs have webbed feet as they spend most of their life in water they will usually have webbed back feet and some will have webbed front feet you may also see sticky pads on a frog s feet toad feet are generally not webbed and do not have pads 2 x research source consider the shape frogs tend to be slender and athletic in appearance toads on the other hand are shorter and stubbier 3 x research source a slender looking amphibian with longer limbs is probably a frog a short chubby amphibian with smaller legs is likely a toad take note of the skin frog skin is a lot smoother than toad skin a toad s skin will be bumpy in appearance while a frog will have smooth rubbery skin a toad may look like it s covered in warts look at the color in general frogs are lighter colored than toads they tend to look greener while toads may have a greenish skin they tend to be darker overall than frogs 4 x research source toads come in various shades that range from a dark green to an olive green frogs are on the more yellowish brighter side of the green spectrum frogs may have a yellow olive color however do not rely on color alone always consider other factors as some frogs do have a brownish green appearance watch how the animal jumps both frogs and toads jump frogs however tend to jump more often and much higher 5 x research source frogs take very high jumps and can also jump great lengths toads take very small hops and lack the ability to jump very far notice if the animal ever crawls toads are much more likely to crawl than hop crawling is a toad s main form of movement you will rarely see a frog crawling an animal that is crawling is very likely to be a toad 6 x research source always consider other factors as an injured frog may crawl consider where you found the animal frogs need to be close to water to survive while toads can spend a lot of time out of water an animal that stays close to water is likely to be a frog if you find an animal far away from water it is probably a toad a frog is unlikely to wander far from a source of water 7 x research source dim your lights to reduce noise from frogs frogs can make a lot of noise at night especially when they re breeding frogs eat insects and bright lights can attract insects near your home this may also cause frogs to gather in your backyard 8 x research source keep things like your porch light off at night you can also use curtains at night to keep light from inside your house from attracting bugs keep dogs away from frogs and toads some frogs and toads may be toxic to dogs if a dog picks up a toad in its mouth toxins could be released that are poisonous to your dog if you see your dog carrying a toad take your dog to a vet immediately this is a medical emergency 9 x research source symptoms of toxins from a toad include excessive drooling pawing at the mouth or eyes seizures difficulty breathing and unsteady moving if your pet has any of these symptoms it needs immediate treatment wash your hands after handling frogs or toads in general refrain from handling wildlife however if you touched a frog or toad wash your hands afterwards 10 x research source if a young child picked up a frog or toad make sure to have them wash their hands do not take in wild frogs and toads as pets it s never a good idea to take in a wild animal as a pet frogs and toads in the wild are not raised in captivity and will not take well to being captured they may also carry diseases if you want a pet frog or toad get one from your local pet store care for a pet toad or frog properly pet stores do sell frogs and toads as pets if you want a pet frog or toad make sure you care for it properly provide the right environment and shelter for your pet 11 x research source you will have to clean your frog or toad s tank every day dirty tanks can pose a major health risk for a frog or toad frogs and toads need a varied diet you can buy food from a pet store composed of crickets and mealworms but you will also need to give your frog or toad plenty of other insects to survive you will need to feed a frog or toad things like grasshoppers snails and silkworms as well limit touching a reptile or amphibian pet even one from a pet store can carry diseases wash your hands after handling your pet do not clean their cage in your bathroom or kitchen and do not kiss or cuddle a pet frog or toad 12 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main

how to catch a frog,frogs are fascinating amphibians and catching them can be tons of fun whether you plan to keep them as pets or study them catching a frog is easy you can build a trap that safely drops them into a bucket or you can use a net and catch them yourself,choose an area near water to set your trap select an area where frogs have been spotted to try to catch one with your trap frogs love water so areas near ponds rivers lakes and streams are good places to try to catch them 1 x research source frogs mostly live on land but will frequently visit wet shady areas and shallow water use a hammer and nail to poke 3 4 holes in 2 medium sized buckets you don t want your buckets to fill with water when you re trying to catch frogs with them so take a hammer and a nail to puncture a few holes through the bottom of them be careful not to crack the bottom 2 x research source smaller frogs may be able to escape through cracks or breaks in the buckets cut a slot in both buckets large enough to fit a plywood board the slots will have a 4 ft 1 2 m by 8 ft 2 4 m plywood board that is 1 2 inch 1 3 cm thick fit into them use scissors or clippers to cut out a 4 in 10 cm deep slot on the rim of each bucket make sure the slot is as wide as the thickness of the board so it can fit into it 3 x research source dig a hole big enough to fit 1 of the buckets in it after you ve chosen the location for your trap dig 1 hole deep and wide enough to fit your bucket into without any of the rim sticking out place the bucket into the hole and make sure the rim is even with the ground 4 x research source if you re near a body of water and can t dig a hole deep enough without it filling with water try to move further away from the water to place your trap fill the area around the bucket with dirt use the dirt from the hole that you dug to fill in any gaps around the bucket there should be no space between the bucket and the ground and it should be held in place firmly 5 x research source try to shake the bucket to make sure it s secure in the hole make a trench 4 inches 10 cm deep and as wide as your board start the trench at the slot that you cut into the bucket make the length of the trench 4 inches 10 cm shorter than the total length of the plywood board 6 x research source make sure the walls of the trench are even and consistent dig another hole at the end of the trench for the second bucket start right where the trench ends and make sure the hole is deep and wide enough to fit the bucket into it use the dirt you remove to fill in the space around the bucket so it s secure 7 x research source make sure the slot that you cut is facing towards the other bucket the rim of the bucket should be level with the ground slide the plywood board into the slots in the bucket the board will slide right into the trench and the slots that you cut into the buckets it should be able to stand upright on its own use dirt to fill in any space in the trench to help support the board 8 x research source you can hammer stakes into the ground next to the board to help support it leave the trap for 12 hours and then check it for frogs as frogs hop along they won t be able to jump over the plywood board and will be safely guided into one of the buckets where they ll be trapped frogs like to come out at night so you need to leave the trap alone overnight or for 12 hours check the buckets in the morning to see if any frogs are trapped in them 9 x research source don t leave the trap for too long or any frogs that you catch could die from dehydration hunger or predators use a net with a handle and an 18 in 46 cm hoop to catch frogs make sure the webbing of the net is small enough so that a frog cannot escape from it choose a net with a handle that is at least 3 feet 0 91 m long so you can reach far enough to catch a frog 10 x research source you can find nets at a local department store or online wait until dark to try to catch frogs most frogs are active at night so you ll have a much higher chance of catching one after dark don t wait in the area for the sun to go down or the frogs may not approach where you are 11 x research source you can kill time by practicing catching tennis balls or something similar with your net look for frogs near the water with your flashlight frogs love water so a great place to look for them is near a pond lake or river they are often found on the banks of ponds or rivers so use your flashlight to shine along the bank look for bright white eyes shining in the light 12 x research source be mindful of snakes as you walk along the bank hold the light on the frog as you approach when you find a frog keep the flashlight fixed on it so it can t see you be as quiet as you can when you approach the frog the light will prevent the frog from seeing you but it can still hear very well 13 x research source drop the net on top of the frog use 1 swift motion to drop the net directly on top of the frog hold pressure down so the frog can t escape as you make your way to the end of the net wait for about 2 minutes to allow the frog to settle down a little bit before you grab it 14 x research source try not to squish the frog with the edge of the net keep the frogs in a container with a lid after the frog has calmed down a bit and stopped jumping around grab a hold of it through the net and lift the net from the ground take the frog out of the net with your other hand and place it in a container with a lid so it can t jump out 15 x research source make sure the container has ventilation so the frogs can breathe locate a body of water small ponds are best make sure frogs abound you can check by listening for them or by observing them on previous visits late spring and early summer is the optimal period in the northern hemisphere search for frogs walk along the edge of the pond or lake and keep your eyes peeled for any frogs on the shore be warned they are often somewhat camouflaged once you find one sneak up behind it move slowly catch the frog cup your hands around it but not too close to it making sure you block off the water quickly bring your hands together to grab it you ll need to grasp it firmly but don t squeeze it because that will possibly harm it,Pets-and-Animals
how to catch tadpoles,tadpoles are small larvae that will eventually turn into frogs after capturing tadpoles you can keep them as pets or re release them into the wild if you decide to catch tadpoles there are a few things you should do make sure you have the supplies prepared before you attempt to catch a tadpole once you pull tadpoles from the water with a small net or jar you ll want to be able to transfer them somewhere right away to carry them home if you choose to raise tadpoles make sure to care for them properly make sure it s safe and legal to catch tadpoles in your area before attempting to do so,gather your supplies before setting out to capture a tadpole you ll want to have certain supplies ready you can find most necessary supplies around your house if you can t locate certain supplies you can purchase them at a local supermarket or drug store 1 x research source you ll need a fine or mesh net to scoop the tadpoles out of the water you can also use a mason jar if you cannot find a net but a net will give you better control you should have something to place to tadpoles in after they are caught you should immediately place them in a container of clean chlorine free water consider bringing a bucket of water with you when you go to catch tadpoles some of the water you caught the tadpoles in may slip into the container so do not full it up completely you may want to wear gloves when catching tadpoles depending on the area where you re catching tadpoles boots may also be helpful wear boots if you re catching tadpoles in a muddy area find an area where you re likely to find tadpoles in order to capture tadpoles you ll need to know where they typically congregate you may have seen tadpoles somewhere around your home or neighborhood this would be a good place to start however if you ve never seen tadpoles before look for them in areas where they re typically found 2 x research source tadpoles tend to live in streams swamps pools and lakes tadpoles are often found near the banks of such places and in shallow water you may see them swimming in large groups occasionally frogs may lay eggs in flooded portions of grass after a heavy rain scoop tadpoles out of the water once you ve located tadpoles catching them is fairly easy you simply need to place your device in the pond stream lake or other body of water use your device to scoop up a few tadpoles 3 x research source a net works best as you can make quick scooping motions with it simply dip the net into the water near the tadpoles and try to scoop water containing tadpoles out of the pond if you do not have a net you can also use a jar however always try to scoop tadpoles some people attempt to catch tadpoles by placing a jar in the water and waiting for the tadpoles to swim into the jar tadpoles are unlikely to swim into an unknown object transfer your tadpoles to clean water once you ve caught your tadpoles immediately transfer them into a container of clean water your water should not have chlorine or salt in it when you ve caught as many tadpoles as you want you can take your container inside and transfer your tadpoles to a safe environment some of the water you caught the tadpoles in will get in the clean water as it will be hard to remove the tadpoles by hand just make sure you only get a small amount of water from a lake or pond into your clean water pick a container you can easily carry you should have something like a bucket which has a handle or a small sealable tupperware container with some holes poked in the lid you don t want to accidentally drop your tadpoles while transporting them to your home as this could potentially kill them pick the proper container you want to store your tadpoles in an aquarium or a similar type of container the container should ideally be made of glass although boxes made of foam or plastic products can also suffice you should never store tadpoles in a metal container 4 x research source shorter wider containers are better than longer narrower containers make sure the container has a lid if the container comes with a ventilation system make sure this system also has a lid tadpoles can swim into ventilation ducts and die create the right habitat unlike fish or other aquatic animals tadpoles do not require a tank with a bottom lined with mold or rocks you can leave the bottom of a fish tank bare and fill it with water 5 x research source keep the tadpole tank in an area in your home that is 95 shaded when the water gets murky remove the tadpoles using a jar or net set them aside in a smaller container and clean the tank make sure your water is safe for your tadpoles tadpoles need clean water or they will not survive make sure you re using fresh tap water do not clean a tadpole tank with chemical cleaners as even small traces of chemicals can harm a tad pool 6 x research source if you have a water filtration system like a brita filter it s a good idea to use this to filter going into your tadpole tank trace amounts of chlorine are sometimes found in tap water even a small amount of chlorine is deadly to a tadpole 7 x research source feed your tadpoles a healthy diet pet stores do sell flakes for tadpoles which you can use following the feeding suggestions on the package however if you can t find tadpole flakes you can use spinach or lettuce to create tadpole food in your kitchen 8 x research source boil spinach or lettuce for 10 to 15 minutes and then drain it well use gloves or oven mitts when draining to avoid burning your hands chop your boiled lettuce or spinach into tiny pieces put a tablespoon per tadpole in your tank once a day for example if you have four tadpoles you should feed them four tablespoons of the lettuce or spinach once a day release tadpoles if you cannot care for them a tadpole is a living thing you should not keep tadpoles as pets if you lack the resources to care for them long term if you do not want the time and commitment that goes along with tadpoles re release them into the wild make sure the area where you re catching tadpoles is safe tadpoles sometimes tend to congregate in swampy areas if you re setting out to capture tadpoles make sure the area is free of poisonous weeds and difficult terrain that could cause you to slip and get hurt wear appropriate shoes like heavy sneakers or boots if you re catching tadpoles in a swampy area 9 x research source check state regulations it is not legal to capture tadpoles everywhere some states may have laws against taking animals out of the wild even in the larval stage check the website of your local department of natural resources if you cannot find the information there you can call the dnr during office hours 10 x research source avoid capturing too many tadpoles it can be easy to end up scooping quite a few tadpoles in one motion as they tend to swim close together if you intend to raise tadpoles remember they will one day grow into frogs you do not want to be left with 10 or 20 frogs to care for stick to catching a manageable amount of tadpoles like 3 to 4 if you end up with more than you want you can release some tadpoles back into the lake or stream before taking your tadpoles home,Pets-and-Animals
how to take care of an american bullfrog,jug o rum jug o rum the american bullfrog is easily recognized by its tell tale call dubbed the bullfrog because of the similarity with the mooing cow s cry this amphibian is an amazing creature to observe as it changes from a tadpole with gills into north america s largest frog to properly take care of one follow these few steps as you begin to learn about nature in your own backyard or in your own backroom,learn the basics about american bullfrogs 1 x research source american bullfrogs are the largest species of north american frogs capable of growing up to eight inches long and weighing up to one and a half pounds 2 x research source they are also fairly long lived with an average life span of seven to nine years in the wild 3 x research source bullfrogs are voracious and cannibalistic feeders requiring a large and steady diet of live prey more on this below the males as well are territorial and often aggressive and are known for occasionally cannibalizing tadpoles and young frogs for these reasons you ll want to think carefully about why and whether or not you really want to commit to raising an american bullfrogs think about bullfrogs as pets while bullfrogs can be fascinating to raise from the tadpole stage and while raising them can provide countless educational opportunities to children they nonetheless are not the best candidates for pets bullfrogs should not be handled 4 x research source the oils from our skin can be harmful to the frogs and similarly the frogs can be carriers of dangerous salmonella 5 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source because bullfrogs can live so long you should be sure that you ll be able to commit to caring for your frog s in the long term if your child s interests are varied and quick changing you might want to reconsider your choice if you can no longer care for your bullfrog you must be very careful about releasing your bullfrog into the wild unless your bullfrog was native to your area non native bullfrogs are considered invasive species and can cause quite a lot of damage and disruption to local ecosystems because bullfrogs are known to cannibalize it s recommended that you keep only one mature bullfrog in a tank think about the commercial aspects of raising bullfrogs frog legs have long been a delicacy and the meat of the american bullfrog is similarly prized it s possible then that you may be thinking about raising bullfrogs for a commercial endeavor 6 x research source while it might seem appealing to raise frogs for meat overall the venture is quite risky those operations which have been successful have been in locations which naturally provide optimal outdoor living conditions for bullfrogs should you decide to proceed with your business operation you ll obviously need a more more extensive set up and habitat for your frogs you ll also need to research and verify the particular regulations to which you ll be subject acquire all of the necessary licenses etc keep in mind that these will vary by state choose your frog s new home if you re lucky enough to live on property with a pond that is already populated with bullfrogs or suitable for their introduction you really won t need to do much to prepare your bullfrog s new home if you plan to care for your bullfrog indoors however you ll need to take additional steps find an appropriate tank 7 x research source your tank should be as large as possible if you re only raising one frog you ll need at least twenty gallons and as a general rule of thumb an additional five gallons for each frog keep in mind of course that you may lose young frogs to cannibalism on the part of the older mature frogs fill the tank correctly 8 x research source you ll need to add pond water soil gravel or rocks and plants from the frog s natural environment there should be a wet area in the tank with the water being deep enough to cover approximately half of your frog s height be sure to add plenty of hiding spots in the tanks with the rocks and plants you ve collected invest in the appropriate equipment for your tank you will want to purchase a good powerful filter for your tank to keep your frog s new home clean depending upon the tank in your home you may also need a light assuming that the room in which you keep the tank is relatively warm 25 28 degrees celsius you won t need a heater for your aquarium bullfrogs require a humid environment so it s possible that you ll need to use a humidifier on occasion you may also want to cover the sides of your aquarium excluding the front where you ll be observing the frogs with colored paper or aquarium backdrops this will help prevent the bullfrogs from jumping against the glass and injuring themselves acquire your bullfrog the consensus among experts is that it is best to harvest local tadpoles as opposed to ordering or purchasing tadpoles or breeding pairs of frogs you ll need either a cage or lidded container depending upon whether you are collecting mature frogs or tadpoles make sure that your cage has a tight fitting lid so as to keep the mature bullfrog from jumping out if you re catching tadpoles bring a sturdy net to wrangle the little guys check that the holes are smaller than your smallest finger so that the tadpoles won t slip through if you plan on catching an adult bullfrog and plan to catch it with your hands wear gloves if you haven t already set up your aquarium with water soil etc from the pond make sure to collect sufficient materials from your frogs first home now transfer your bullfrog to its new home this step is pretty self explanatory once you ve caught your new bullfrog friend transport him home carefully and place him in his new home give your new pal time to acclimate and be sure that you ve provided your bullfrog with plenty of tasty food to hunt see the next part for more detailed instructions on how to feed and care for your bullfrog feed your tadpoles 9 x research source feeding requirements for tadpoles are fairly simple tadpoles are primarily vegetarian thus so long as you ve populated your tank with native plants from their natural habitat your tadpoles should have a sufficient food source 10 x research source you can also supplement with animal feed available from pet stores american bullfrogs remain in the tadpole stage for an extended period of time up to a year or longer depending upon the species and climate once they reach their mature stage their feeding needs will change feed your bullfrog american bullfrogs are known for their voracious appetites and so you ll need to be prepared with a steady supply of varied food options adult bullfrogs eat insects worms tadpoles small fish and even young frogs and small snakes 11 x research source they will only eat moving prey so you ll need to supply them with live food because bullfrogs have a seemingly unending appetite you ll need to be careful not to overfeed them young juvenile frogs should be fed only once every couple of days and adults only need to be fed only two to three times a week you may also want to consider adding a calcium supplement to the frog s prey clean your bullfrog s home while you have been careful to create as natural of an environment for your bullfrog as possible the ecosystem you ve created is not self sustaining so you ll have to commit to a fair amount of maintenance 12 x research source you ll find it handy to purchase a pair of aquarium forceps these will be useful for removing frog feces and any leftover food you should do this regularly ideally every day be sure to replace replenish your frog s water supply regularly every week or so you should remove approximately one third of the tank s water and replace it with fresh dechlorinated water the frog s water should be slightly acidic and free from pesticides or other contaminants you may need to use a commercial dechlorinator care for your bullfrog s health bullfrogs are susceptible to a number of diseases and illnesses be on the lookout for any changes in behavior or appearance is your frog lethargic is your frog eating less or not at all is your frog s belly bloated is your frog s skin reddened or different in color at all if so these are all signs of failing health and you should be prepared to take your bullfrog to a qualified veterinarian enjoy your bullfrog it may seem as though preparing to welcome your bullfrog is an involved process but it really isn t with care and attention you should be able to observe and enjoy your american bullfrog for years to come,Pets-and-Animals
how to catch a bullfrog,bullfrogs make a deep rumbling song in the spring and summer at night you ll see their bright eyes looking back at you from the shoreline if you are excited to catch bullfrogs you should check with state authorities to find out when the season is scheduled and what places you can go hunting in your region as long as you have a license and a few simple tools catching bullfrogs can be an enjoyable summer activity remember to respect any bullfrogs you catch and to release the small ones,choose your tools this will depend on what your goals are if you are planning to just catch frogs for fun you may want different tools than if you re planning to eat frog legs for dinner bullfrogs can be caught bare handed but your hands should be clean and wet bullfrogs absorb things through their skin so dirty hands could harm the frog alternatively you may want to consider other tools such as a frog gig a frog gig is especially good for catching larger bullfrogs if you don t have a frog gig a fishing net is also a good option you ll also need a flashlight and something to hold the bullfrogs like a bucket 1 x research source if you are catching frogs to keep in an aquarium you may want to use a net or your hands a fishing net with a longer pole works best the brighter the flashlight the better if you use a fishing pole a fly fishing lure without a barb is a good choice if you re transporting the frog consider bringing a large plastic bucket with a lid find a good bullfrog habitat bullfrogs dwell in freshwater lakes ponds rivers and streams they tend to live where there is a tree canopy cattails and little to no current make sure you are hunting on public land during bullfrog season 2 x research source never hunt for bullfrogs in a conservation area don t hunt on private property unless it is your own listen for the chorus of bullfrog calls bullfrogs make a distinctive low toned bass like call which sounds like a low ru u umm ru u umm from early spring until summer the male bullfrogs will sing together in a deep roaring tone follow this sound to catch them 3 x research source go hunting at night wait until the moon comes out to go frogging since it is easier to see the bullfrogs at night you ll want to wait till it is really dark outside 4 x research source shine an led light along the shoreline to find bullfrogs use your led flashlight to light up the shoreline of the pond or stream move the beam of light slowly until you see a pair of bullfrog eyes 5 x research source if the eyes are set wide apart it is a big bullfrog 6 x research source move slowly and quietly if you are walking take gentle steps if you are in a canoe don t let your paddle hit the side of the canoe stop and pause occasionally since you are likely to spot frogs more easily if you search for movement on the banks or in the river or bog 7 x research source shine the light in their eyes to jack the bullfrog as soon as you get to around 10 or 15 yards away direct the led light right into their eyes this method is called jacking the bullfrog will go into a trance like a deer in your car headlights use this opportunity to catch the bullfrog with your hands frog gig or other instrument 8 x research source jacking a bullfrog means using a strong flashlight directed at the frog s eyes at night pounce quickly and use a firm grip since bullfrogs are quick to respond to movement you ll need to pounce quickly and use a firm grip they can easily slip out of your hands so grab them firmly around the upper thighs you will probably only get one chance 9 x research source hold the bullfrog by grasping around the upper thighs with its legs together this position minimizes chance of injury while making it difficult for the critter to get away put the bullfrog in a closed container take the bullfrog off the gig if you used one and put it in the sack or container close the lid if it is a burlap sack pull the drawstring to close the bag unless you close the container or bag the bullfrog will hop away 10 x research source let the little bullfrogs go if you are catching bullfrogs to eat you should let the little frogs go use your hands to catch the the little ones and then put them back in the water 11 x research source use a five pronged frog gig for the large bullfrogs if you see a larger size bullfrog with eyes set wide apart you ll need a bigger tool don t bother with the regular sized 2 inch frog gig rather pick the five pronged frog gig to ensnare the larger bullfrogs 12 x research source find out the bullfrog season in your region if applicable you ll need to find out the local bullfrog season for your region although a few places like texas and florida or locations where bullfrogs are considered an invasive species allow bullfrog hunting all year most places have a few summer months designated for bullfrog hunting your local tackle store should be able to give you the dates for bullfrog season but if they can t tell you you can always contact your local department of parks and wildlife 13 x research source for instance the bullfrog season in kansas goes from july 1st to october 1st 14 x research source decide whether you are going bullfrog hunting or fishing since the type of license you require to catch bullfrogs often depends on how you will catch them you ll need to make this decision before getting your license once you have an idea of what kind of fishing or hunting instrument you want to use such as a frog gig you should contact your department of fish and wildlife to find out if it is legal and what type of license is required 15 x research source a traditional and challenging way of catching bullfrogs is by hand which is a lot of fun many people prefer to use a six or eight foot pole with barbed tines which is called a frog gig people also use fishing lines dip nets bows and rifles if you are using a fishing net you may need a fishing license get a fishing or a hunting license call your department of parks and wildlife to find out what license you need if you are using fishing methods to catch bullfrogs you ll need a fishing license however if you are shooting bullfrogs you ll obviously need a hunting license pay for the license that is required for your region and the instrument you want to use 16 x research source stay within the fishing or hunting limit your region will have a limit on the number of bullfrogs you can catch during bullfrog season which is typically set by the department of parks and wildlife give them a ring or look on the website to find out the limit for your region it is important to stay within this limit which will help to ensure the integrity of local ecosystems and allow you to come back and catch more frogs next season 17 x research source for instance kansas has a limit of 24 bullfrogs,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for african dwarf frogs,african dwarf frogs are small frogs that are native to africa these frogs are relatively easy to care for as they take about the same level of care as goldfish set up an appropriate tank for your tiny friends including enough water to keep each frog happy and healthy in addition these frogs prefer live food like bloodworms or black worms though they can also eat frozen food,purchase 2 or more african dwarf frogs to house together these frogs like to live in social groups so don t just get one having more than one at a time is really not any extra work and you ll have happier healthier frogs 1 x research source these frogs can be in a tank with fish but avoid putting them in with aggressive fish for instance bettas can be good tank mates but it depends on the betta as some of them are more aggressive than others if you put a betta in with these frogs watch their behavior particularly at meal time to see if the betta is bullying the frogs 2 x research source aim for a tank with 1 to 2 gallons 3 8 to 7 6 l of space per frog while you can keep african dwarf frogs in smaller areas the water gets dirty too quickly plus this much space gives each frog enough room to move around 3 x research source choose a shallow tank to make it easier for the frogs to get to the surface while these frogs stay in water all the time they actually don t swim all that well 4 x research source make sure to get a tank with a secure lid as the frogs can jump out 5 x research source these frogs don t need any special lighting for their tank but they can handle special lighting if other fish in the tank need it add large gravel to the bottom of the tank the gravel needs to be large so the frogs don t accidentally eat it when foraging for food fill the tank up to about 1 inch 2 5 cm from the bottom pick aquarium safe gravel 6 x research source rinse the gravel until it runs clean before putting it in your tank fill the tank with conditioned tap water put 20 inches 51 cm or less of water in the tank add the specified amount of complete water conditioner to the amount of water in your tank the back of the bottle should tell you how much to add as it depends on the brand make sure to use a dedicated measuring spoon don t reuse it for food mix the water conditioner into the water 7 x research source you can find complete water conditioners at most pet stores or online these conditioners remove chlorine chloramine and even heavy metals that could harm your frogs make sure to leave enough room at the top of the tank for the frogs to surface and get air about 2 inches 5 1 cm is fine 8 x research source set up a filtration and aeration system the frogs absorb some oxygen from the water and having these systems helps increase the level of oxygen in the water find filtration and aeration systems designed for frogs at pet stores or online 9 x research source however the tank shouldn t have strong currents as the frogs cannot swim that well you should be able to tell once you set the tank up if the frogs seem to have trouble swimming you may need to turn the filtration system down 10 x research source add aquarium safe hiding places and decorations pvc pipe can provide a hiding place however you can use any decoration that s marked aquarium safe don t use things you find outside as that could introduce bacteria to your frogs 11 x research source the frogs need space to hide from the light at times which is why they need caves or pvc pipe it s also a good idea to have a large branch or structure that goes up to the surface of the water that gives the frogs a place to sit when they re breathing air use a tank heater to keep the water between 70 and 80 f 21 and 27 c the ideal temperature for these frogs is 77 f 25 c a tank heater that warms the water will go a long way to keeping these frogs happy and healthy 12 x research source heaters come in 2 main varieties one kind the submersible version sits along the bottom of the tank it heats the tank evenly because heat rises from it the other kind has coils that sink below the water at the top of the tank with controls on top of the water but you must remember to turn it off before taking out water it doesn t heat the water as evenly but it should be sufficient for your frogs with a tank heater you also need an aquarium thermometer so you can monitor the temperature and ensure it s not getting too warm it s also a good idea to have a thermometer even if you don t have a tank heater to make sure the frogs aren t getting too cold 13 x research source if you don t buy a heater set the tank in a warm area to make sure these frogs are happy buy live food for your frogs these frogs prefer small live prey such as daphnia mosquito larvae black worms bloodworms and brine shrimp you can find these foods at most pet stores or you can order them online rinse any food well in cool tap water before giving it to your frogs 14 x research source they may also eat some fish flakes if you re feeding them to other fish in the tank if you don t want to use live food you can try feeding them pellets made for african clawed frogs 15 x research source alternatively you can use frozen food but make sure it s thawed before adding it to the tank feed the frogs all the food they can eat in half an hour every other day add several small scoops of the food you choose to the water and let the frogs eat for 30 minutes once the time is up take out any food that s left behind 16 x research source make sure that if you have other fish in the tank the frogs are eating as well sometimes they can be crowded out by aggressive fish watch the tank when its feeding time to make sure everyone is eating if you have aggressive fish who want to eat the frogs food try buying sinking food for the frogs such as sinking shrimp pellets the fish will take the food at the top while the frogs will eat the food at the bottom 17 x research source siphon off 10 20 of the water each week and replace it to clean the tank you can use a turkey baster for this process pull the water out of the tank with the turkey baster and dispose of it replace the water you removed with dechlorinated water you don t need to replace the water completely unless something goes terribly wrong and even then it s not always a great idea as it can shock the frogs 18 x research source don t dump the water in your kitchen sink as it could spread bacteria around don t take the frogs out of the water as they need the water to stay alive in fact it s better not to handle them at all treat them as you would fish 19 x research source wash your hands thoroughly every time you touch the tank these frogs can carry salmonella and it can pass to you when you open the tank wash your hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds before rinsing every time you mess with the tank 20 x research source make sure everyone who comes into contact with the tank does so as well watch for the frogs to shed their skins frogs will shed their skin like other amphibians they may look whitish before they shed which is perfectly normal after they may eat the skin they shed if they don t you can remove it from the tank with a pair of tongs 21 x research source if the frog still looks white after shedding their skin your frog may have a fungus treat fungus and bloat with aquarium salt if your frogs have continually white skin they likely have a fungus also frogs can look bloated like they may explode which is likely due to a bacterial infection unrelated to fungus for either one add 1 tablespoon 17 g of aquarium salt per 4 gallons 15 l of water stir it into a cup of dechlorinated water before adding it to the aquarium to dissolve it 22 x research source if you notice fungus or bacterial infections talk to a veterinarian before treating your frogs if only one frog has a fungal infection move it to its own tank to treat it aim for as big a tank as you can manage only do this when the frogs have fungus or bloat as they are not that fond of the salt however it should get rid of the fungus if it doesn t talk to your vet avoid fish fungal medicines as it can harm frogs copper based medications especially are toxic to frogs check with your vet to make sure the salt treatment is safe for your other fish move eggs to their own tanks if you see clusters of eggs and you want to raise them they need to be in their own tank gather up the eggs with a turkey baster and gently release them in a newly prepared tank the eggs will look like small bubbles prepare the new tank in the same way you did for your frogs but keep in mind each egg could become a frog so you may want a significantly bigger tank 23 x research source if you don t move them the frogs may eat them you can feed live baby brine shrimp to the tadpoles when they emerge,Pets-and-Animals
how to find a frog,frogs are fun and interesting creatures as they are in almost every part of the world finding them can be a good diversion while on a camping trip or with your small child frogs tend to live by bodies of water hidden beneath fallen logs and along embankments you might end up getting a little dirty but finding a frog can be an exciting reward,make sure you re in the right climate except for antarctica and some of the colder parts of the world like upper siberia frogs exist basically everywhere they are however most numerous in the more tropical regions 1 x research source in the entire world there are about 4 740 species of frogs in the united states for example there about 90 different species of frog get out there during spring and summer you want to make sure you re looking for frogs in the right season they re most active in spring and summer because this is when they re looking for food and spawning 2 x research source in autumn the frogs tend to be trying to settle down for the colder months and for winter they usually bury themselves somewhere protected like beneath a log or beneath the mud at the bottom of a pond find an area with water in it frogs take in water through their skin so they need water around in order to keep from drying out the water should have little to no current and should preferably be somewhat protected 3 x research source good places to check for frogs are swampland watersheds or along the banks of streams lakes and ponds check for potential food sources when you do go out looking for frogs go to an area that has lots of insects earthworms minnows and spiders these are the types of food that frogs like to eat get out there at night frogs tend to be more active at night than they are during the day this is when they get out and hop around looking for food or for a mate usually when it s day they hide and wait until the sun s heat and light has passed on by 4 x research source be careful when you re hunting frogs at night especially if it s in a more isolated area bring a flashlight and check out the area sometime during the day before you go that night so that you can make a note of any potential dangers or problems gently check objects that serve as hiding places you do not want to scare or injure the frog frog species are already disappearing at a rapid rate due to changes in their habitats and encroachment by humans check beneath decaying logs in bushes and even in piles of leaves listen for splashes in the water when you approach an area where frogs are living they will be likely alerted to your presence and will try to hide they may hop into the water alerting you to the fact that there are frogs not all splashes in the water are going to be frogs however they could also be fish or even snakes so make sure that you re paying attention use a small mesh net the holes in the net must be small enough so that your frog can t fit their head through them frogs can injure themselves if they stick a leg or their head through a hole and get stuck make sure that the mouth of your net is big enough to cover the frog otherwise you might bring down the sides of the net on some vulnerable part of the frog avoid using a butterfly net to try to catch a frog they are built for more delicate and fragile creatures and will be too flimsy to contain the frog catch the frog with the net once you ve found your frog and you want to catch it you have to make a plan based on whether the frog is positioned on the ground or in the water if it s on the ground you ll need to bring the net down over its body if it s in the water you ll need to position the net under it and scoop it out of the water if you ve trapped it in the net on the ground you want to put your hands gently around the frog s back and legs you want to be holding onto the frog s hips with its legs pointing out behind in this position you can lift the frog and cradle it in your hand while it s still in the netting if you re scooped it out of the water you ll need to grab it gently by its hips with its legs pointing out behind it use your hands to catch the frog if you re using your hands you want to lower your hand without the frog noticing this means slowly and quietly gently grab onto the hips and the back legs of the frog so that it can t escape avoid squeezing the frog hard you hand just enough pressure so it can t escape but too much pressure can hurt the frog at night spotlight the frog shining a bright light at a frog in the middle of the night will cause the frog to freeze making it easier for you to catch it using a flashlight will also help you locate the frog at night because the beam of the flashlight will reflect off their eyes gently return the frog to its environment unless you have a permit for gigging hunting them you need to return the frog to where you found it some frogs are protected as endangered species so make sure that you check regulations concerning the frogs in your area if you want a frog as a pet it is best to get one from a licensed pet store and raise it from a tadpole landscape naturally the more you can landscape naturally in the environment that you live in the more likely you are to attract frogs into your very own yard you don t even need to have lots of space to do so 5 x research source plant native forbs shrubs and trees to provide foliage nectar pollen berries seeds and nuts that wildlife need to survive on frogs are considered a good indicator of the health of an ecosystem so by attracting other animals you ll also attract frogs make sure that there is good cover for animals especially for frogs cover can be things like native vegetation shrubs thickets and brush piles or even the logs of dead trees create a pond water is necessary for a frog to survive by building a natural seeming pond in your backyard you can entice frogs to come and stay the size of your pond depends on how much space you have 6 x research source obviously it isn t possible for everyone to create a pond in their backyard but you can create a water source out of a low wide trough or pot used for planting if you are going to construct a pond you ll need to consider things like how deep it needs to be if your area freezes for example it may need to be deeper to keep things alive throughout winter how to keep the algae in check barley straw is a good natural way to eliminate algae you want your pond to resemble a natural pond as much as possible this means native plants debris settling on the bottom of the pond perhaps even a log or branch floating on the surface a pond like this will balance itself naturally with minimal seasonal algae growth construct a toad abode this is basically a little ceramic house for a toad or frog you can easily create one yourself by turning a ceramic flowerpot upside down create a crack or hole in one side to act as an entrance or you can prop it up on a rock so your frog can get in and out 7 x research source www nwf org kids family fun crafts toad house aspx keep it in a shady spot that s close to a water source a pond or even a largish saucer of water watch out for invasive frog species keep updated on the kinds of frogs that are native to your area invasive frog species such as the cuban tree frog taking over in florida can eat native frogs as well as competing with them for food and territory 8 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to play with your african dwarf frog,african dwarf frogs are incredibly social creatures and while they shouldn t be handled outside of their habitat there are plenty of ways to play with them using regular food and treats you can entice them to move around the tank and train them to follow you playing with your african dwarf frogs makes their life in the aquarium a little less dull,place some food at the tip of a turkey baster use your frog s regular food such as bloodworm or brine shrimp and place a little bit at the end of a turkey baster suck the food slightly into the baster to keep it securely attached to the tip underwater you can use treats instead of regular food if you so wish but be careful not to use too much or your frog may not want to eat its regular food later on 1 x research source a nice treat includes beef heart or krill position the tip of the baster about 1 2 in 2 5 5 1 cm above the frog s head remove the tank cover but do not take your frog out of the aquarium as it needs to be fully submerged in water position the tip of the baster in the water just above the frog s head and wait for it to get interested you can gently sway the baster back and forth in the water to spread the scent of the food more effectively 2 x research source wait for your frog to notice the food and watch it jump up and eat it your frog should realize there is food above it soon enough but if it doesn t then keep trying and be patient 3 x research source as long as it can t reach the food just by stretching it should jump up in the water and try to get the snack from the tip of the baster if your frog still doesn t want to jump up even after it realizes there is food above it it might be too high up lower the tip of the baster slightly until your frog is able to reach it repeat every day raising the baster slightly higher each time you can train your frog to jump higher and higher each day by raising the tip of the baster a little bit higher than you had it the previous day keep offering your frog food as it won t be interested in jumping for no treats keep the baster in the water no matter how high it wants to jump after several days or it could jump out on accident while trying to reach the food outside of the water frogs are strong jumpers 4 x research source wash your hands with unscented soap and thoroughly rinse with water frogs are delicate creatures and their skin is extremely absorbent compared to many other animals wash your hands and make sure to rinse them with water for at least a minute to get rid of any soapy remnants 5 x research source do not handle a frog with your bare hands even if you washed them as the oils from your skin as well as all forms of soap can cause damage to the frog 6 x research source put some of your frog s food on your index finger use enough food so that the frog will be able to see it on your finger from inside the aquarium 7 x research source you can balance bloodworm or shrimp on your finger or use fish pellets don t dip your finger in the water or the food may fall off and you won t have anything to entice your frog with trace your finger outside of their enclosure in random slow patterns don t touch the tank and smear the food instead trace a random pattern slowly in the air just outside the tank african dwarf frogs have notoriously bad eyesight so keep your finger close to the glass 8 x research source live food may be more effective than dead food in which case you should use tweezers to hold a fly or other live bug in place while you trace it in the air watch the frog follow your finger and after a few minutes let it have the food after a few minutes of playing with your frog drop the live food into the enclosure and let it have the treat after a handful of times doing this you may find that your frog follows your finger instinctively 9 x research source give your frog treats every time it follows your finger over time it will associate your movements with treats and will keep playing with you tie a thin string tightly around a piece of food such as bloodworm securely fasten a piece of bloodworm to the end of a long string use fishing wire a colored fabric string or something else firm and thin that will effectively wrap around a small piece of food you may find that a frozen bloodworm is the best option to tie to a string 10 x research source you can use live food but it will be harder to fasten around the string do not use a fishing hook with live food on the end of it when the frog goes to eat the food it will hook itself fishing hooks are for catching fish not playing with your pets 11 x research source dangle the string in the water of your frog s aquarium and wait till they notice it dangle the string about halfway into the aquarium and let it float near your frog it should notice the food in a few seconds and start to go for it 12 x research source using fishing wire or a strong thin string is recommended as it won t deteriorate in the water and can be used multiple times in a single play session move the string gently around in the water to get your frog to chase it when your frog starts to go for the food move the string to another corner of the cage to get it to chase the string keep doing this until the frog gets tired and then lift the string out of the water to remove the food it s important to remove the food from the string so that the frog doesn t eat the string along with their tasty treat if your frog does end up catching the string don t panic pull the string out gently from the frog s mouth if you have to pull the frog out of the water for just a few seconds with your cleaned and rinsed hands and the frog should instinctively let go of the string 13 x research source let them eat the food then try it again without any treats tied to the string after removing the food from the string drop it back into the water so your frog can have a tasty treat 14 x research source then if you want to play with them again dangle the string in the water without anything tied to it and see if they react,Pets-and-Animals
how to raise frogs,frogs are one of the most diverse type of animals with several thousand species living everywhere from deserts to underwater kids may enjoy catching tadpoles from a nearby creek and raising them until they turn into frogs other frog owners enjoy watching an exotic pet develop and live sometimes for 20 years or more because of their incredible variety and because of national or regional laws limiting frog ownership research frog species to find out which one is right for you before buying or capturing a pet,research laws about raising tadpoles in your area many countries and regions require people to apply for an amphibian license before they are legally allowed to raise tadpoles or frogs some species may be illegal to raise under any circumstances usually because they are an endangered species search online for information about national and regional laws in your area or contact a local department of wildlife management or department of natural resources australia has especially strict laws about raising frogs and these vary from state to state a summary of each state s laws can be found here if you are purchasing tadpoles from a pet store you could ask the store s employees about laws in your area find a plastic or glass container short wide containers are better than tall narrow ones because the larger water surface results in more oxygen from the air entering the water 1 x research source you can purchase a plastic critter tank at a pet store or use any clean plastic or styrofoam container do not use any container made of metal or tap water that runs through copper pipes 2 x research source try to find a large container to avoid overcrowding your tadpoles use a plastic kiddie pool if you are raising a large quantity of them even frog eggs can die if kept in a small container although the reasons for this are unclear 3 x research source fill the container with pond water rainwater or dechlorinated tap water tadpoles require clean water and could die if placed in tap water which has not been treated to remove chlorine and other chemicals ideally use water from a pond where tadpoles are swimming or rainwater if this is not possible treat tap water with dechlorination tablets purchased at a pet store or leave the container of tap water in sunlight for 1 7 days to break down the chlorine do not use rainwater if you area suffers from acid rain or there are industrial operations nearby if your tap water contains fluoride you may need additional filters to remove the fluoride before it is safe for tadpoles add sand some species of tadpoles forage in the sand for small particles of food and will thrive in a container with 0 5 inch 1 25 cm of clean sand at the bottom you may use small non sharp aquarium gravel or gather sand from a river bank sand collected from beaches or quarries is not recommended as it contains harmful levels of salts or other substances in order to remove these substances fill small containers not the tadpole container halfway with the sand then to the top with water let sit for 24 hours drain the water away then repeat with fresh water at least six times 4 x research source add rocks and plants including a way to climb out of the water almost every tadpole species requires a way to leave the water once they have transformed into a frog as they may no longer be able to remain underwater indefinitely rocks that extend above the water surface are a good option aquatic plants gathered from a pond or pet store provide more oxygen and a place for tadpoles to hide but do not cover more than 25 of the water surface as this prevents oxygen in the air from entering the water 5 x research source note place the rocks near the edge of the tank as some species of frogs will only look for land at the edge of the water not the center 6 x research source do not use plants that have been treated with pesticides or other chemicals as these could kill the tadpoles keep the temperature constant tadpoles just like aquarium fish are sensitive to changes in water temperature and could die if moved to a container with a much higher or lower water temperature than the water they came from if you re buying the tadpoles or eggs from a pet store ask what temperature you should keep the water at if you re collecting them from a stream or pond use a thermometer to measure the temperature of that water try to get your new water temperature as close to this as possible if you cannot get an expert to identify your species and offer more precise advice try to keep your water between 59 and 68ºf 15 20ºc 7 x research source be prepared to move the container indoors before a frost occurs keep the water in partial shade if the weather becomes too hot consider an aquarium aerator if your container is wide and there are aquatic plants in the sand but not covering the surface it likely gains enough oxygen from the air and an additional aerator could cause the tadpoles to bloat 8 x research source if you are only raising a few tadpoles they will usually get enough oxygen even if the conditions are not ideal if you are raising a large number of tadpoles and the conditions described don t match your tank you may wish to add an aquarium aerator to keep air moving through the tank acquire frog eggs or tadpoles keeping regional and national laws into account you may collect the tadpoles or frog eggs from a local pond or stream purchasing them from a pet store is another option but do not purchase exotic or imported species if you intend to release the tadpoles into the wild frogs can survive many years and can require a substantial amount of care so it is recommended that you raise local species only for your first attempt use a soft net or small bucket to scoop up the tadpoles and place them in a transportable container filled with the water they are swimming in tadpoles can be damaged if bumped or scratched and cannot breathe in air as a rough guideline each 1 inch 2 5 cm long tadpole requires 1 gallon 3 8 l of water 9 x research source keep in mind that most tadpoles will grow much larger before they become frogs overcrowding the tank can lead to disease or insufficient oxygen add the eggs or tadpoles to the new container but only once the water temperatures are equal if your water temperature is different than the temperature of the water they came from place the container of tadpoles in their old water inside the new container but keep the container opening above the surface so the two bodies of water don t mix leave it there until the temperatures of the two bodies of water have equalized then release the tadpoles into the larger container feed tadpoles small amounts of certain soft leafy greens tadpoles thrive best on a diet of soft plant matter which should be given to them in small quantities whenever they run out of food leaves with algae growing on them can be collected from stream or pond bottoms and fed to the tadpoles alternatively rinse baby spinach never adult spinach dark green lettuce or papaya leaves thoroughly chop them into small pieces and freeze them before feeding you can also feed them very small pieces of peas that have been soaked in luke warm water and placed on the surface of the water 10 x research source check with a pet store employee or online before you feed the tadpoles any other type of plant fish food flakes are not typically as high quality as straight vegetables but can be used if they contain mostly spirulina or other vegetable matter not animal protein 11 x research source crush large flakes into tiny pieces and feed a pinch a day feed the tadpoles the occasional insect while tadpoles should be given a little animal protein occasionally their digestive systems cannot handle large amounts of it to keep these protein supplements to safe levels and ensure that the tadpoles are able to eat them use frozen food intended for fish fry such as frozen bloodworms or daphnia 12 x research source give these to the tadpoles in small quantities once a week you may feed them larger quantities of insects once they become frogs although they may not eat for a short time following the change fish fry food is available wherever live fish are sold clean the water regularly whenever the water becomes cloudy or smelly or when the tadpoles stay clustered near the top of the tank it is time to change the water make sure to use the same type of water the tadpoles are swimming in treated with dechlorination tablets if necessary leave the new water out until it is the same temperature as the existing water or the temperature change could kill the tadpoles replace 30 50 of the old water with the new water at a time 13 x research source the water will stay cleaner for longer if you don t feed the tadpoles large amounts of food at once each serving of food should be gone within 12 hours at most and then immediately replaced avoid using aquarium water filters to keep the tank clean unless you are sure they are too weak to drag the tadpoles in or force them to swim against the current 14 x research source sponge filters can be used safely provide calcium tadpoles need calcium to grow their skeletons and may not be able to acquire enough from their regular diet pet stores sometimes sell cuttlebone for this purpose which should be rinsed thoroughly before placing in the container then left there permanently alternatively use a liquid calcium supplement intended for aquariums adding one or drops for every quart liter of water whenever you change the water 15 x research source once cuttlebone piece about 2 inches 10 cm long should be enough for a small tank prepare for metamorphosis depending on the species and age the tadpoles may become frogs within a couple weeks or take several months once they develop legs and begin to lose their tail the froglets should try to exit the water have a plan prepared as soon as you start to see changes in your tadpoles most frogs cannot breathe underwater indefinitely so be sure they have a rock or other non metal platform at the edge of the tank to climb onto and reach the air a few species will fail to climb out on their own so you may need to lift them out with a soft net once their tails are half gone 16 x research source attach a secure lid to your tank with plenty of air holes weigh it down with heavy objects if it does not latch shut to prevent the frogs leaping out know how to release the frogs if you caught your tadpoles locally you may release the frogs in an area of damp vegetation near the same water source you caught them in if you cannot release them immediately keep them in a plastic tank with a cover of leaf litter and bark pieces large enough to hide under do not fill the tank with water but provide a shallow water dish for the frogs to sit in and spray the tank s sides with water once a day 17 x research source if you wish to keep raising your frogs or if you need to care for the frogs for more than a day before releasing them continue on to the next section find out the needs of your frog species before you acquire the animal some species of frogs require extensive care so make sure you know the needs of your frog species before you acquire a new pet if you are a beginner you may wish to start with a non poisonous species that do not grow to a large adult size 18 x research source www pets4homes co uk pet advice keeping frogs as pets what every amphibian owner should know html many frog species don t like to be handled or remain still for large periods of time which may make them less interesting for children you may wish to choose a local species which you can legally release back into the wild if you change your mind about raising it be aware that some national or regional governments require an amphibian license or forbid the raising of frogs entirely search online for laws which apply to your region learn whether your frog live on land in water or both many frog species need access to both land and water in order to thrive which may require a special two part aquarium tank that allows it to move between the two others only require a shallow water dish to sit in while still others are entirely aquatic and can breathe underwater even in adult form make sure you know your frog s needs before setting up a tank if you collected your frogs from the wild get a biologist or someone from the nearest department of natural resources to identify the species find a glass or clear plastic pet tank glass aquarium tanks or terrarium tanks are best suited for most frog species clear plastic tanks will work as well but be aware that some frog species require an ultraviolet light which could damage the plastic over a long period of time 19 x research source make sure the tank is waterproof and escape proof but also contains plenty of air holes or mesh for ventilation do not use metal mesh as the frogs could injure themselves on it 20 x research source for tree frogs and other climbing frogs pick a large tall tank with room for place branches and climbing structures maintain the tank s temperature and humidity whether or not you need a heater and or humidifier for your tank depends greatly on your frog species and local climate so seek expert advice or search online for more information about your species temperature requirements if you need to keep the tank to a certain humidity consider purchasing a hygrometer to measure this number so you can spray the sides with water if it drops too low in a two part tank setup air and water heating the water with an aquarium heater may be the most effective way to keep the tank warm 21 x research source cover the bottom of the tank with natural material whether in air or water the frog needs a natural base to walk on once again the exact way you should accomplish this depends on species a pet store employee or experienced frog owner who knows your species may recommend sand gravel peat moss or a mixture of these 22 x research source burrowing species require a thicker layer to dig into provide an ultraviolet light if necessary some frogs require an ultraviolet light for 6 8 hours a day 23 x research source research your species to find out if this is necessary and ask a pet shop employee about which uv light to use there are many types some of which may overheat your tank or provide them with the wrong wavelengths of light 24 x research source as for regular artificial lighting fluorescent lights produce less heat and therefore dry out the frog s skin less quickly than incandescent bulbs provide clean water and change regularly for land dwelling species provide a dish of rainwater or other frog safe water large enough that the frogs can sit in it up to their shoulders if the frog species requires a two part tank or a fully aquatic tank treat it as you would an aquarium tank this means using rainwater or other frog safe water installing an aquarium aerator and a water filter and replacing 30 50 of the water with clean water at the same temperature whenever it gets cloudy or bad smelling change once every 1 3 weeks for best results depending on how crowded the tank is tap water can be treated with dechlorination tablets and if necessary a fluoride filter to make it safe for use by frogs do not use tap water if your plumbing has copper pipes as the trace amounts of copper can be toxic to frogs 25 x research source if your tank is kept warm as it should be for some species warm the new cold water to the correct temperature in a stainless steel saucepan do not use hot tap water add plants or branches if necessary underwater aquarium plants in underwater portions of the tank may help clean and oxygenate the water and provide hiding places which frogs enjoy climbing frogs need natural or artificial climbing branches while most frog species enjoy hiding spots such as large upside down bark segments choose a selection of appropriate live food almost all frog species eat live insects in the wild and sticking to a diet of varied insects is usually a good choice 26 x research source worms crickets moths and insect larvae are usually appropriate foods and many frogs are not picky about what they eat if they are not used to a particular diet already 27 x research source however it is always a good idea to check what your species requires and to provide it with food appropriate to the size of its mouth mice or other non insect meat can strain the frogs organs unless they belong to a large species that had adapted to live on this type of protein do not feed your frog large ants which are capable of killing frogs many frogs will not recognize non moving objects as food but you could try to feed a frog individual dead insects by holding them near its mouth with a pair of tweezers coat the food in calcium and vitamin supplements for amphibians frogs require a source of calcium vitamins or both since they cannot get enough of these nutrients from insects alone amphibian vitamin and calcium supplements are available in powdered form for sprinkling on the insects before feeding there are many brands of supplements available and the best one to use depends on the frog s diet and characteristics as a general rule use separate calcium supplement and vitamin supplement not past the expiration date and avoid high phosphorus supplements if crickets are the frog s main food 28 x research source it may be easiest to place the insects and a small amount of the powder in a container and shake the container around to coat the insects choose feeding times according to age and climate the exact needs of your frog depends on species but you may follow these guidelines if you have no specific instructions that match your species young frogs may not eat at all immediately after emerging from the water but will soon begin to eat rapidly and have food always available to them adult frogs are usually fine being fed once every three or four days eating 4 7 insects appropriate for their size during cooler weather frogs do not require as much food 29 x research source remove dead insects floating in the water whenever you see them know how to handle your frog many frogs do not enjoy being touched or can even irritate your hands or be damaged by contact with your skin 30 x research source however if your frog belongs to a species that is safe to handle and does not squirm or urinate when you pick it up you may handle it carefully research your species to learn whether it is safe to handle even if gloves are not required wash your hands thoroughly before and after handling rinsing two or more times to remove all traces of soap or lotion,Pets-and-Animals
how to take care of an aquatic frog,aquatic frogs are fun low maintenance animals ideal for someone who doesn t have a lot of time on their hands but would still love to have a pet as an added bonus the frogs fit into small places ideal for the home with little space their care requirements are simple although they are very different from those of fish,use a 10 gallon 38 l tank that is no more than 12 in 30 cm deep your frog will need enough space to move around with ease if you have more than one frog you will need an extra 1 gallon 3 8 l per frog the more space the better 1 x research source aquatic frogs especially dwarf frogs are not particularly strong swimmers but they do need to come up to the surface of the water to breathe regularly anything deeper than 12 inches 30 cm will make it too difficult for your frog to surface if the tank is crowded it will not only cause stress to your frogs but it will also mean you will have to clean the water more often install a tank cover with no openings aquatic frogs like to jump if there are any openings in the top of your tank they may jump out of your tank aquatic frogs will die if they are outside their water habitat for more than 15 20 minutes even small openings in the tank lid for filters or air lines may be big enough for your frog to hop through be sure you get a lid that has covers for any unused holes or buy the covers separately some aquarium covers come with plastic on the back side where you can cut small openings for any wires or tubing that needs to go into the tank cut the holes so they fit the wires or tubes very snugly so the frogs won t be able to get out that way give your frogs a variety of hiding places aquatic frogs feel more happy and secure if they have somewhere to hide use aquarium decorations or shelters specifically designed for aquatic frogs you can also use live plants or soft artificial ones try using unpainted clay flower pots lying on their side in the tank this is a perfect hiding place for your frogs and it s an easy and budget friendly solution for you don t use anything in the tank that is painted or glazed some of the chemicals can leach out into the water and poison your frogs add a standard aquarium light aquatic frogs don t need fancy basking lights like reptiles do however they do need regular periods of light and dark to mimic their natural outdoor habitats you can buy a regular aquarium light and a timer set to give the frogs 10 hours of light per day led aquarium lights are long lasting and energy efficient while most tank plants will thrive under led lights if you have a more exotic plant like ammannia crassicaulis or other plants that require high lighting to thrive check with your local aquarium supplier to find out if you might need to get a special plant light to keep it happy keep the frogs comfortable by heating the water to at least 75 f 24 c aquatic frogs prefer a water temperature around 78 f 26 c you can either always keep the room where the frogs live at 80 f 27 c or find an aquarium heater at your local pet store or aquarium specialist many aquarium heaters attach to the inside of the aquarium and must stay fully submerged in the water if you want to free up more space inside your aquarium for plants and inhabitants get an in line external heater that sits on the outside of the tank it s also a good option if you have a lot of plants in your tank the submersible heaters are not as effective at circulating the warmth in a heavily planted space use an aquarium filter for fewer water changes a filter will help keep the water clear and balanced with a water filter you will only need to change the water when the nitrate levels get too high aquatic frogs are very sensitive to noise because of this filters that sit inside the tank can be far too loud for them use an external canister filter instead find it at your local aquarium supply store place noise absorbing padding under the filter to reduce the vibration and noise in the tank itself be sure your frogs legs can t get sucked into the inlet slots or holes for the filter if in doubt find an intake sponge at your local aquarium supply and place it over the intake hole add an aerator especially if there are fish in the tank because frogs come up to the surface for air they don t absolutely need an aerator but installing one will keep your tank water healthy by encouraging good bacteria to thrive it is also necessary if you have fish or shrimp or any other creatures breathing with gills living in the tank buy a standard air pump and an air stone at your local aquarium supplier an aerator can also be a source of entertainment for your frogs many of them like to play with the air bubbles the hum of the air pump can irritate the frogs sensitive ears try to isolate the pump by hanging it from a nail in the wall so it doesn t touch the wall or the side of the tank fill the tank with conditioned water put room temperature non chlorinated water into the tank fill the tank until it is three quarters 3 4 full attach and activate your lights heater and aerator if you are using spring water that you know has no chlorine or chloramines all you will need to do is add a starter bacteria additive find one at your local aquarium supplier for small aquatic habitats this will introduce healthy bacteria to your water and make it ready for the frogs use a dechlorinator to remove any chlorine or chloramine from the water both of which are harmful to frogs if don t have a dechlorinator and you know for sure that your water only has chlorine and not chloramine you can let your tank sit undisturbed for 48 hours to let the chlorine evaporate before adding your frogs add a substrate to make your tank more attractive frogs don t need to have anything covering the bottom of the tank but it can be visually appealing buy a colorful aquarium gravel in a color that contrasts with your frogs so you can see them better if you do use a substrate buy an aquarium vacuum cleaner so you can vacuum out any bits of food or other debris every week so it doesn t get stuck in the gravel and rot keep clawed frogs in a tank separate from other species the most common aquatic frogs are the african dwarf frog and the african clawed frog their care requirements are the same but the clawed frog should not share the aquarium with other species you can easily house dwarf frogs along with small aquarium fish or shrimp 2 x research source dwarf frogs have webbed fingers on their front legs clawed frogs have no webbing on their front feet dwarf frogs are under 2 inches 5 1 cm in length whereas clawed frogs can reach a size of 5 8 inches 13 20 cm as adults although you should never release any pet into the wild this is especially true for clawed frogs they are extremely predatory invasive species feed your frogs until they are full 3 times per week pick three non consecutive days per week monday wednesday and friday for example to feed them give them as much food as they will eat in about 15 minutes you will have to experiment a bit to find the right amount remove any uneaten food from the tank with a net or aquarium vacuum after 20 minutes so it doesn t start to rot and dirty the tank water frogs are opportunistic feeders which means they will always eat if they find food that s why if you feed them every day they will become overweight you can also add ghost shrimp to the tank to help you clean up any unwanted food they are better at scavenging for food at the bottom of the tank than the frogs are so they will find any tiny bits of food that the frogs and your vacuum or net might miss be sure to buy large shrimp because the frogs will eat shrimp if they can get their hands on them and fit them into their mouths if you are using a commercial aquatic frog food remember to follow the dosage instructions on the label purchase commercial frog pellets or sticks commercial foods are usually manufactured for aquatic turtles newts and frogs you can find it at most pet stores check the feeding instructions on the label for the correct feeding amount average sized frogs usually need 3 6 sticks per meal break the stick in half to make it easier for them to swallow most pellets will specify 3 or 4 pellets per frog per meal add variety to your frogs meals commercial frog food will ensure that your frogs get the right nutrients however once or twice per week you can feed your frogs something more exciting instead of the commercial pellets or sticks try live or frozen brine shrimp frozen bloodworms finely chopped earthworms or tiny pieces of frozen beef heart for example if they are being fed on mondays wednesdays and fridays try giving them a meal of commercial pellets or sticks on monday when they are the most hungry because they haven t eaten over the weekend then feed them special frozen foods on wednesday and friday talk to your local aquarium specialist to find the right alternative food for your budget and your frogs live bloodworms have hooks that can injury your frogs throats so be sure to only feed them the frozen variety check the dosage recommendations on the frozen food you buy most come in small frozen cubes one cube is usually enough to feed 3 frogs for one meal cut the cubes with a knife warmed under hot water place the food at the bottom of the tank use a turkey baster to put the food directly onto the bottom of the tank you may want to use a small terra cotta dish to put the food on so the frogs will always know where to find it if your tank has filtration and aeration that results in a lot of water movement in the tank the food will not stay on the terra cotta dish in this case simply put the food on the bottom of the tank for the frogs to find on their own frogs don t have great vision so they may not realize there is food for them before it starts to spoil to help them out gently tap on the glass 3 times every time you are about to give them food they will learn that the tapping means they should get ready to look for food if you have fish in your tank it s especially important to place the food at the bottom where the frogs can easily get to it if you simply sprinkle the food on the top of the water the fish will eat most of it before it gets down to the frogs start by feeding the frogs during the day then switch to nighttime feeding although frogs are somewhat nocturnal they can easily adapt to being fed during the day it s also easier for you to gauge how much food they are eating if you feed them when their aquarium light is on once you get the hang of how much they eat you can switch to feeding them as soon as their light turns off in the tank to simulate their wild environment replace 20 of the water and rinse your filter every 14 days to do this use an aquarium water change kit from your pet store turn off the filter take it out and rinse it with some of the tank water to clear out any debris set everything up just as you did when you first got your frogs refill the tank ¾ full with conditioned water and add a starter bacteria additive take out and clean any accessories in the tank with tank water and a scrubbing brush you can also use a small bucket to scoop water out of the tank check the water chemistry weekly with an aquarium water test kit find the test kit in your local pet store or online the kit will measure the levels of ammonia ph nitrate and nitrite fill the provided test tubes with water from your tank add the test drops according to the instructions and then compare the results to the color card in the kit follow any recommended care instructions on the card you can also use aquarium water test strips which are a bit easier to use but will be more expensive in the long run replace 30 of the water if the ammonia or nitrite levels are high if your water test kit shows that you need to lower the ammonia levels slightly or lower the nitrite levels start by replacing 30 of the water with fresh conditioned water and cleaning out any debris in the tank you can also increase the aeration of the tank to help prevent the problem in the future 3 x research source you may want to buy some neutralizing drops from your local pet store although they won t fix the imbalance they will neutralize the negative effects on your frogs and other inhabitants add plants to the tank to reduce nitrate levels although nitrates are not as harmful to frogs as ammonia or nitrite they still cause reduced oxygen levels which can stress out fish and frogs plants use up nitrates so adding plants to the tank is the most effective way to keep nitrate levels under control 4 x research source add baking soda to the water if you need to increase the ph use 1 tsp 4 9 ml of baking soda for every 5 gallons 19 l of water to increase the ph remove your frogs gently with a net and place them in a holding tank before trying to raise the ph dissolve the baking soda in a little water add the mixture to your tank stir it and wait approximately 30 minutes then put the frogs back in the tank 5 x research source find a frog holding tank at your local pet store or use a bucket filled halfway with tank water retest the water one day after you added the baking soda if it s still too high you can repeat the process once per week until you achieve the right ph level add driftwood to your tank for an easy and natural fix for high ph boil 1 2 pieces of driftwood to sterilize them before adding it to the tank driftwood is like a natural filter that removes contaminants to lower the ph level you can find driftwood at a nearby beach or buy it at your local pet store don t buy driftwood meant for reptiles as these have often been treated with harmful chemicals,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for common frog tadpoles,watching tadpoles grow is a good way to teach the process of metamorphosis to children either at home or in the classroom caring for your tadpoles means providing a habitat that is as much like the tadpoles natural habitat as you can the common frog tadpole is native to the united kingdom and can be found throughout ponds streams and lakes throughout europe,get a container to use for a habitat the best container will be rather short and shallow rather than deep having a wide top allows more air to be exposed to the air allowing oxygen into the water good containers can be purchased at most pet stores and are good for small numbers of tadpoles you can easily reuse a container of your own however 1 x research source a plastic container will be easiest to move glass containers are not recommended as they may break metal containers including those covered with enamel or porcelain should not be used make sure your plastic container hasn t been used to carry or store chemicals which may damage your tadpoles if you have the space plastic molded kiddie pools can provide a good living container for many tadpoles consider using sand in your habitat tadpoles generally enjoy having sand on the bottom of their container as they often feed on microbials small life forms found with the sand this makes it a good choice however having sand in your habitat will make it more difficult to keep clean 2 x research source river sand is best as it doesn t contain salt which is a problem with beach sand if you are getting sand from the beach make sure to rinse it multiples times to remove any trace of salt from the sand you may also use rocks in the base of your habitat very tiny round rocks can be purchased at many pet stores never use sharp edged rocks larger pebbles or glass as these can damage your tadpoles fill your container with water unpolluted pond water or fresh rain water is ideal never use water straight from the tap as it may contain chemicals that are hazardous to growing tadpoles make sure you use enough water best practice is to use 1 liter per tadpole 3 x research source tap water may be used only if it s been allowed to sit for at least 3 days so that any harmful chemical will have evaporated don t use tap water containing fluoride unless you can treat it with reverse osmosis or another special water filter which specifically says it removes fluoride if you live in an area where rainwater is scarce use bottled spring water distilled water or water treated with reverse osmosis provide ways to provide oxygen for the tadpoles the two best ways to do this are to have an aerator which adds air into the water or to grow leafy plants within the habitat good choices of plants are those which grow entirely under the water have a long stringy growing habit and lots of small leaves along the length of the stem 4 x research source if you will be collecting tadpoles from a stream having a gentle aerator running in your habitat is a good way to provide oxygen if you ll be transporting the tadpoles from a stagnant pond an aerator may be too disruptive keep water at an even temperature the ideal temperature for common frog tadpoles is between 59 and 68 15 c and 20 c if your outdoor temperatures will make this difficult to maintain you ll need to be able to keep your tadpole habitat inside 5 x research source if the temperature rises above this pollution can be a problem to raise the temperature in your tadpole habitat you may need to invest in an aquarium heater hanging heaters in glass tubes are the most common but nonbreakable heaters in titanium or stainless steel can also be purchased to lower your tank s temperature try positioning a fan that blows air across the water s surface this will also increase evaporation so make sure that you re replacing the lost water as your water cools 6 x research source you can also freeze water in plastic bottles and place these bottles inside your tadpole habitat this functions as ice cools liquid in a glass keep temperatures consistent if you can remove only about 1 3 of the water from the tank as you clean it take care when scooping out the water and refill slowly so that the tadpoles and any material on the bottom does not get churned up 7 x research source if you need to create another container with fresh rain water in it and gently scoop up the tadpoles with a cup or net and deposit them into the new tank the water you re bringing the tadpoles from should be about the same temperature as the water you re bringing them to transitions between different temperature water can result in shock and death collect frogspawn you can easily capture all the frogspawn frog eggs you want to raise from a local pond lake or stream bring a net or a bucket to this water source when you arrive at the prepared habitat use a small mesh net to collect and transfer the frogspawn 8 x research source make sure you can put the frogspawn directly into their new habitat raise the tadpoles separately from other aquatic animals they should get their own habitat watch for frogspawn to hatch when tadpoles are first hatched you should have a quantity of fresh pond weed partly as food and partly as support for young tadpoles dried stinging nettle leaves crushed into a fine powder can also be fed to the young tadpoles 9 x research source scatter the pond weed and nettle leaves across the surface of the water tadpoles eat only vegetarian fare until their legs start to grow feed your tadpoles tadpoles in the wild normally feed on algae but this may be difficult to find where you life feeding each tadpole two tablespoons of boiled lettuce or spinach is a good substitute for algae vegetarian fish flakes are another option but avoid any fish flakes that incorporate animal byproducts you should feed your tadpoles twice a day once in the morning and once in the afternoon 10 x research source add two crushed rabbit food pellets to supplement the diet of each tadpole you don t need to feed them this more than once a day twice a week you can add some hardboiled egg yolk to their diet to provide protein ensure that your tadpoles get sufficient calcium calcium is necessary to build the young bones of your tadpoles the easiest way to do this is to add 2 drops of liquid calcium per liter of water or 4 drops per gallon 11 x research source read the label carefully to make sure it doesn t contain additives that may be harmful to your tadpoles adding a piece of cuttlebone a sea shell to the tank will also provide a nice natural source of calcium clean your tank frequently you ll know that the water needs changing if you notice a cloudy appearance or unpleasant odor to the water watch for tadpoles lingering near the surface or waste settling at the bottom of the tank make sure that any new water is the same temperature as the water already in the tank drastic changes in water temperature can kill your tadpoles 12 x research source to clean your tank you will need to have a second location where you can keep the tadpoles while you clean the inside of their tank if your water isn t very dirty you can leave the tadpoles in their habitat while removing about a third of the water never use commercial cleaning products which may contain harmful chemicals a clean tank will help prevent your tadpoles from getting infected or diseased look for signs of infection ranavirus is the most common virus to affect cold blooded amphibians like tadpoles tadpoles affected by ranavirus may appear lethargic or you might notice them swimming erratically weakly or on their sides 13 x research source bacterial infections are the main cause of death among frogs and tadpoles the best way to prevent infection is to improve your tadpoles immune system through proper maintenance of their habitat nutritious food and adequate oxygen signs of infection might be easiest to see by looking at the water if you notice your water appearing cloudy yellowish white or a slimy series of bubbles all along the top of the water s edge there s likely to be a higher chance of infection developing watch for metamorphosis the first signs of your tadpoles development into a full grown frog will be the front legs or arms starting to bud soon thereafter the mouthparts completely change the tadpoles gills stop functioning and their lungs start to work so that they can breathe air the skin changes from a smooth and slimy skin to a rougher porous skin which allows air and water through 14 x research source internally the tadpoles intestinal tracks will change from the long intestine of a plant eater to the short intestine of a protein eater which will comprise most of an adult frog s diet you ll see limbs containing a skeleton grow out of a body which had no limbs or bones as the tail muscle and fin deteriorates and is reabsorbed by the body put a lid on your tadpole tank as your tadpoles develop limbs they ll be at risk of making their way out of the tank you ll want to prevent this from happening both for the safety of your fledgling frogs and for your human habitat 15 x research source the best lid will be well ventilated in order to let in fresh air while still keeping your frogs safely inside a lid that attaches to the tank is best some commercial tanks come with snap on lids which work quite well put something the frogs can climb into the tank while you want to make sure your new frogs don t get out of their tank you ll also want them the opportunity to climb from the water and use their developing lungs to breathe air a fat stick or a wide rock that rests on the base of the tank is a good choice once the frog starts to use its lungs to breathe it s unable to use its gills without some way to climb out of the water the frog may drown make sure the object is fixed so that it can t move when the frog is on it know how long your tadpoles metamorphosis will be the common frog takes about 10 weeks to transition from tadpole to frog at this point the legs and lungs will have developed enough to allow the frog to emerge from the water these new frogs are known as metamorphs the metamorph will continue to have a small tail for a short time before it is absorbed by the rest of the body it will take the metamorph 2 3 years to reach breeding age know when it s time to release your tadpoles when your tadpoles have developed arms and legs it s time to let them go back into the wild ideally you ll be able to release your frogs back into the same area from which you took them if you can t do this make sure you re releasing them into an area in which the common frog is commonly found 16 x research source if you aren t sure what variety of frog you ve raised check with an expert before releasing your frogs into the wild when you ve identified your frogs look at a frog guide to find out what habitat this species of frog typically prefers then locate a setting that will meet the needs of your new frogs,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for african clawed frog tadpoles,whether you re intentionally planning on caring for african clawed frog tadpoles or woke up one day to discover eggs in your frog s tank it s important to understand how to properly care for tadpoles so that you can successfully raise them into adult frogs thankfully it s easy to care for the eggs and once you know how to feed the tadpoles and to prepare them for adulthood you ll be on your way to raising full grown african clawed frogs,separate tadpole eggs from the adults a female frog can lay anywhere from 500 to 1 000 eggs and the rate of survival depends on the conditions of the tank the most important factor is to keep the adults separate from the eggs otherwise the tadpole eggs are in danger of being eaten by the adults 1 x research source after you notice the first egg watch out for more to follow in the next 2 4 days there s a good chance the eggs will hatch at night so check the tank every morning dedicate one tank to the eggs the tank should be fairly wide but not overly tall a good tank size is anywhere from 6 10 gallons with a water level of 7 12 inches deep 2 x research source keep the water temperature a bit higher for tadpoles at around 75 degrees fahrenheit once the tadpoles are older they can be kept in water that is slightly cooler at 70 degrees fahrenheit 3 x research source you can purchase an aquarium heater from a local pet store to heat the water just be sure to have a thermometer in the water so that you can monitor the temperature this is also the point where you need to decide how many frogs you d ultimately like to raise as most of the tadpoles will reach maturity so long as the environment is suitable watch for the eggs to hatch eggs typically hatch within 2 4 days 4 x research source once hatched the tadpoles will be white in color transparent and extremely tiny despite their initial small size the tadpoles will grow quickly this is why it s so important to keep the eggs in a large tank 5 x research source look for them to swim freely being able to swim freely is a big milestone in the life of a tadpole initially they will simply attach themselves to the side of the tank but within a few days you ll notice they will be swimming head down this is an important milestone in the life of a tadpole but it s also your cue to start feeding them up until this point they will be living off of the yolk sac they are born in feed the tadpoles once they start swimming freely now that the tadpoles are swimming freely it s time to feed them tadpole food there are a few different food options including powdered egg and extremely fine goldfish food you can find powdered egg at major retail stores such as walmart goldfish food can also be found at major stores or pet supply stores if you choose to use goldfish food the flakes will need to be ground into a powder you can use a mortar and pestle to grind the flakes into a fine powder tadpoles should not be overfed a good rule of thumb is to create a small o of food for each of the tadpoles at the top of the tank the o should be small and roughly the same size as 14 point font that should be sufficient for the day 6 x research source make sure they aren t taking too long to eat if you notice the tadpoles are taking longer than an hour and a half to eat this is an indication that they are being overfed it is actually dangerous to overfeed the tadpoles as the excess food accumulates in the tank and prevents oxygen from getting to the tadpoles 7 x research source because of their transparent appearance you can actually see the food in their stomachs their bellies should not be bloated if they are being overfed make the o of food slightly smaller continue to monitor their eating habits as they grow you may need to increase the amount of food you re feeding them ensure the food is circulating properly it s important to make sure the food is small enough and circulating properly tadpoles don t have a mouth at this stage so food is absorbed through a filter if the food isn t circulating they aren t able to receive the proper nourishment 8 x research source make sure to space out the o s of food do not place them all in one spot having an adequate amount of water about one liter per tadpole will help to ensure there is enough space to properly spread out the food use a scoop instead of a net to ensure the survival of your tadpoles never use a net to touch or retrieve them if you must move them use a cup to gently scoop them out of their current space and into a new one 9 x research source similarly you should never use your hands as a method for transporting tadpoles this is just as dangerous as using a net change out 20 30 of the water every day it is crucial to the tadpole s survival to keep their tank clean changing out a part of the tadpole s water every day will help to ensure the cleanliness of both the tank and water 10 x research source you do not need to empty the entire tank on a daily basis instead you should carefully scoop out about 20 30 of the old water and replace it with fresh clean water use either bottled water or de chlorinated water however as long as the water isn t overly acidic your tadpoles should thrive 11 x research source clean the tank every week to two weeks even though the aquarium only needs to be cleaned on a weekly or every other week basis you should still try to inspect it every day to ensure its cleanliness to clean the bottom of the tank try using a turkey baster this will help you to extract some of the dirt and debris at the bottom without disturbing the tadpoles when you do fully clean the tank transfer the tadpoles to another temporary tank make sure the water conditions are similar to that of their aquarium once the tadpoles have been moved thoroughly clean the tank and sterilize everything including any decor use a cleaning product that is reptile friendly products can be found at any major retail store or specialty pet store 12 x research source tadpoles are sensitive to their environment so in order to ensure their survival be sure to keep up with the regular cleaning as long as the environment is kept clean you should expect the majority of your tadpoles to reach adulthood switch the tadpoles to adult food you will need to closely monitor your tadpoles for physical changes which indicate they are ready for adult food some of these physical changes include the appearance of front legs as well as the disappearance of their tail 13 x research source the appearance of front legs is your first sign that your tadpole will be transforming make note of this change on a calendar wait for the tail to shrink down to a stump at this point you should begin feeding the tadpole adult food it will take approximately 10 days from the appearance of front legs for the tail to shrink to a stump by marking the date on a calendar you ll have a good idea as to when you ll need to purchase adult food lean raw beef or an earthworm is an acceptable first food for the adult frog the food should be bite sized so that they are able to easily consume it plan on feeding them only 3 4 times a week,Pets-and-Animals
how to breed frogs,people breed frogs for many different reasons hatching tadpoles is a classic way to demonstrate the amphibian life cycle to students or young people whether in the science classroom or at home frog enthusiasts may want to breed rarer species of frogs in captivity finally frogs can be raised for human consumption though this is not yet commercially viable in many places,research the regulations for collecting and raising wild frogs in your area contact your local conservation department to ensure that you do this project safely and get any necessary permits in australia for example you will need to get a free permit in order to collect tadpoles for genuine educational reasons 1 x research source don t trespass in order to collect eggs or tadpoles 2 x research source never collect eggs tadpoles or adults belonging to endangered species many kinds of frogs are threatened around the world find out which species of endangered frog lives in your area and learn how to identify their eggs and tadpoles in order to avoid collecting them 3 x research source collect eggs and larvae also known as tadpoles visit a pond small lake or creek to find eggs or tadpoles in the spring to early summer use small jars or nets to capture the eggs or tadpoles measure the temperature of the water and use insulated carrying cases to maintain that temperature in the jars you used to transport the eggs or tadpoles frogs lay small eggs in clusters or strands usually under water and attached to vegetation tadpoles resemble small dark fish with large heads 4 x research source your area may limit the number of eggs tadpoles or frogs you can collect and it may require you to have a permit keep track of where you collected the eggs or tadpoles to facilitate return later on set up a frog friendly habitat using an aquarium fish bowl or large glass jar a shallow bowl with a large rock in the middle works well you don t need deep water use water from your collection site and add to it using only de chlorinated water providing about half a gallon per tadpole never use straight tap water 5 x research source aerate the water using an appropriate aeration device 6 x research source if you have collected eggs add them directly to the tadpole container don t keep them in a smaller container at first 7 x research source feed the tadpoles the natural food for tadpoles is algae and tiny plant matter if you can t obtain algae you can replicate this at home or school by grinding up commercial goldfish food and by boiling and cooling lettuce or spinach not cabbage 8 x research source feed tadpoles twice daily removing any uneaten food within an hour to keep the water clean supplement this diet twice a week with flakes of hard boiled egg yolks to add protein change the habitat to accommodate the baby frogs tiny frogs need to be able to climb out of the water immediately to avoid drowning once tadpoles start to develop hind legs provide a gently sloping area such as a small pile of rocks or natural not treated wood 9 x research source feed the baby frogs frogs eat insects and small crustaceans you can feed your baby frogs on meal worms or aphids which can be found on infested houseplants 10 x research source release the frogs to their natural habitat as soon as possible 11 x research source use the notes you made earlier about where you collected the eggs or tadpoles release the frogs early enough that they will have time to hibernate for the winter early fall is the latest you should release your frogs 12 x research source never transport frogs and release them in a new location you risk introducing non native species diseases or parasites make sure you have male and female frogs depending the species you can tell the sex of adult frogs in various ways ideally you should have a group of frogs that contains more males than females male red eyed tree frogs are larger than females and only the males vocalize 13 x research source by contrast female tiger leg monkey frogs are larger than the males 14 x research source manipulate your frogs environment to induce readiness for breeding in the wild frogs breed seasonally to give tadpoles and baby frogs the summer to grow and develop you will need to use light and temperature manipulation to simulate seasonal changes to your frogs when breeding red eyed tree frogs cut down on the frequency of misting the terrarium lower the temperature by about five degrees fahrenheit your frogs may need to eat less during this time but monitor their health after a month return the temperatures to normal mist heavily and feed plenty of food 15 x research source place frogs ready to breed together in an optimal environment learn how to recognize the signs of breeding readiness in your species of frog you will need to design an environment that mimics the situation in which frogs breed in the wild female red eyed tree frogs will swell with eggs and males will begin to vocalize frequently they will need to be moved into a rain chamber designed to mimic a rainy forest setting an overhead hose should provide falling water and there must be large leaves for depositing eggs 16 x research source return the adult frogs to their usual home once their eggs have been laid allow eggs to develop into tadpoles making sure that newly hatched tadpoles can immediately enter warm water red eyed tree frog tadpoles require a water temperature of about 75 degrees fahrenheit 17 x research source feed tadpoles with finely ground fish food maintain water quality by changing occasionally using an aerator and not allowing old food to linger in the water make sure that tadpoles have a way to climb out to air when they become baby frogs cover the terrarium with a screen to prevent tadpoles from climbing out feed baby frogs on insects such as wingless fruit flies and small crickets keep baby frogs moist baby frogs may die if they become dried out 18 x research source maintain adequate temperatures and simulate day and night using a light source 19 x research source prevent in breeding by not allowing siblings to breed with one another do not continually breed from the same small population of frogs this decreases genetic variation and may lead to the development of inherited diseases 20 x research source have realistic expectations frog farming for human consumption is not economically profitable in the united states right now most frog legs come from bangladesh belgium china indonesia japan mexico and taiwan they are often harvest wild there due to the difficulty of intensive frog farming 21 x research source be wary of get rich quick schemes based on farming frogs for human consumption focus instead on producing frog legs for personal or small scale enjoyment follow any local laws and regulations you may need to purchase a wildlife breeder s permit in order to raise frogs be sure that your frog farm does not violate local zoning laws or disturb protected species or wetlands choose the appropriate species for your purposes edible frogs include the green frog rana clamitans the leopard frog rana pipiens the pickerel frog rana palustris and the bullfrog rana catesbeiana the bullfrog is the one most often farmed for food in north america set up your breeding area many frog farms are natural marshes or ponds that have been modified to limit predators retain frogs and allow for easy supplementation of food and capture set up a fence to protect the area an adult bullfrog needs about twenty feed of shoreline for its feeding territory increase the available shoreline by building inlets coves and islands ensure that the water is deep enough to protect the frogs and tadpoles from extreme temperatures in areas with cold winters six to twelve feet may be required to allow for hibernation in the bottom mud feed tadpoles on boiled potatoes vegetables and meat scraps don t feed them the remains of butchered frogs because this might transmit disease feed frogs on live insects and small crustaceans paying for a supply of live minnows crayfish and insects to feed your frogs will be one of the most expensive aspects of a frog farming operation however frogs generally refuse to eat food that is not moving use a strong night time light at outdoor farms to attract flying insects prevent and treat diseases many diseases arise from over crowding be sure to allow plenty of room for your frogs if you see evidence of disease isolate affected individuals and treat them with antibiotics,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for northern cricket frogs,northern cricket frogs make good pets as they do not grow very large and are easy to catch but like any pet they require a specific diet and environment to thrive in captivity if you are considering getting a northern cricket frog as a pet make sure you are prepared to properly care for it,make sure it is legal to catch and keep northern cricket frogs in your area since these frogs are endangered in some areas of the united states it may not be a good idea to catch one and take it from its natural habitat 1 x research source currently the populations of this species are increasing and stable make sure you do a search to find out the population levels of this frog in your area and determine if it is safe and allowed to catch them alternatively you might consider making your own backyard a better environment for the frogs if the population is still recovering in your area you can help rebuild it by enriching its natural habitat avoid using fertilizer and avoid cutting down vegetation surrounding any natural water sources in your vicinity get a large enclosure even though these frogs don t need a lot of height they do need a good amount of width and length in their tank or aquarium most frogs do well in a 20 gallon tank so check your local pet store for a tank this size or larger this will allow the frog enough space to thrive 2 x research source make sure you have a lid on your enclosure use a soft screen lid this will allow air to flow into the tank while keeping the frog inside and safe 3 x research source northern cricket frogs are non climbing frogs so they do not need branches in their enclosure to climb on and the enclosure does not need much height 4 x research source use moist soil to line the bottom of the enclosure since these frogs normally inhabit areas near lakes streams ponds and other water sources they need moisture to thrive 5 x research source create a slight slope with the soil in the bottom of the enclosure these frogs live on the banks of water sources so having a slope will make the enclosure more similar to their natural habitats 6 x research source use organic soil without any chemicals or fertilizers in it you want to make sure it is as close to the frog s natural habitat as possible you can also use pine bark that is easily found at any garden supply store 7 x research source decorate the enclosure with plants use these plants to create a canopy in the enclosure in the wild northern cricket frogs live in areas with canopies created by vegetation along the banks of different water sources 8 x research source you can use artificial or plastic plants you can buy these at most pet stores in the aquarium section you can also get small hollowed out logs or rocks for your frog to hide inside of 9 x research source the canopy can partially or completely cover the enclosure but you might consider leaving some areas for light to peek through to the bottom put water in the enclosure you can use a water dish or simply place water at the bottom of the slope you created with the soil this will recreate the natural habitat of the northern cricket frog use clean filtered water you can buy a kit that will separate your tank into two parts land and water this will allow you to use an automatic filter in the water cleaning a frog s tank is a lot like cleaning a fish tank but you might have to do it more often because frogs tend to shed pretty often a water filter will help keep the water clean between actual tank cleanings regardless of how you incorporate the water make sure there is enough of it to allow the frog to keep himself wet as needed house different species of frogs in different tanks if you have a different species of frog already and want to get a northern cricket frog give the new frog his own enclosure 10 x research source you can house multiples of the same species in the same tank but don t overcrowd your tank keep only two or three frogs in any one 20 gallon enclosure if you choose to keep different species in the same tank make sure the other species you choose require the same environment as the northern cricket frog you will want to choose a species that does not need too much height and enjoys a damp environment learn what to feed your frog the primary diet of northern cricket frogs is insects particularly mosquitoes 11 x research source but as a rule of thumb most frogs will eat and enjoy crickets as a meal these frogs will also eat an abundant amount of different species of water bugs and arthropods they are generally opportunistic in what they eat and since they dwell near fresh water sources they will eat whatever is present in their habitat you could even keep some earthworms in the moist soil in the frog s enclosure to allow the frog to eat those feed your frog live food northern cricket frogs and most other frog species feed almost entirely on living moving prey that they have to catch to eat if the prey is dead or not moving they may overlook it entirely if your frog doesn t seem interested in the live food at first he may just not be hungry leave the food in the enclosure and the frog will eat it eventually when he wants it feed your frog at least once a day you may need to feed your frog more or less than this depending on their appetite and how fast they eat what you give them this may take some guessing and testing at first since you will likely be putting live insects into the enclosure for your frog to eat it may take a little while for your frog to find and eat the prey every frog will have different feeding behaviors just watch your frog during each feeding session and evaluate his needs start with 2 or 3 insects first then see how fast they eat them deciding how much and how often to feed your frog will take some time and evaluation of your frog s feeding habits 12 x research source maintain a steady supply of food you can catch insects on your own or go to a pet store to purchase insects for it to eat since this frog is particularly small you will want to make sure you buy or catch very small insects for it to eat you can use a net to catch insects like mosquitoes and keep them in a jar with a few tiny air holes poked in the top when you purchase insects from the pet store they will come in a container that you can keep them in until you are ready to feed your frog or you can make your own container to use and reuse to house your frog s food just use a thumbtack to poke air holes in a small plastic container to allow air in but not allow bugs out 13 x research source maintain a warm moist environment in the enclosure you want to make sure your frog feels at home in its enclosure this means maintaining the vegetation soil and water use a spray bottle to wet the enclosure a few times a day this frog lives in naturally damp and moist environments so a spray bottle can help maintain this level of moisture 14 x research source you can buy a product called vermiculite which retains water and slowly releases it over time this will help keep your tank s humidity and moisture level more stable your frog will need high humidity in its enclosure the misting will help with this but make sure to keep the enclosure relatively warm to aid in keeping the humidity level stable these frogs exist in the wild in many different climates but keeping your enclosure between 75 and 80 degrees fahrenheit will keep him the most comfortable avoid keeping a bright light on the enclosure even if your enclosure is properly outfitted with a canopy of vegetation these frogs are more likely to be active in lower light too much bright light could also be damaging to their vision don t put your tank in too much direct sunlight this will cause algae to grow more rapidly and you will have to clean the tank more often 15 x research source in the wild these frogs are most active around dusk when the light isn t too bright but it isn t quite nighttime yet if you want to catch one of these frogs try looking around this time 16 x research source clean the enclosure when necessary make sure to change out the water in the enclosure and clean the interior when it appears dirty like any other pet this frog will require fresh water and a comfortable living environment remove the frog from the tank to clean it keep your frog in a safe container with a vented lid while you clean the tank empty the tank completely and use warm water only to clean everything in the tank including your plastic plants replace the soil with new soil and refresh the water 17 x research source watch for any symptoms that your frog might be sick or injured there are some easy to spot symptoms of sickness or injury that you should be mindful of when caring for your frog sitting totally out in the open during the daylight hours cloudy eyes discoloration looking very thin and swelling of the body are all symptoms of illness 18 x research source the best thing to help your frog recover is to seek advice from a vet and to keep it safe and out of harm s way while it recovers 19 x research source understand the breeding habits of northern cricket frogs if you have a male and female cricket frog in the same enclosure they may breed their breeding is aquatic meaning it will happen in the water 20 x research source if you end up with two frogs that breed the eggs will be laid in the water be mindful to check for eggs before cleaning the water should you have a male and female frog in the same enclosure 21 x research source females can lay up to 400 eggs at a time in small groups of between 2 7 eggs monitor how many eggs your female frog lays should you breed your frogs 22 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to bathe your frog,under normal circumstances you should never bathe a pet frog nor even handle it any more than is necessary doing so is a risk to the frog s health and maybe even your own instead simply provide it with a daily supply of clean unchlorinated water so it can bathe itself if you must handle the frog wash your hands wear gloves and be very careful if and only if you are a professional working in a scientific setting you may need to bathe a frog in an antifungal solution as part of its quarantine procedure,choose a bowl that allows your frog to submerge in the water you ll add frogs soak in moisture through their skin instead of drinking water so choose a bowl or dish that gives them room to soak comfortably the bowl should permit a water level that s just barely deep enough for the frog to submerge fully but shouldn t be so deep that it s difficult for the frog to get in and out 1 x research source stainless steel or ceramic bowls or dishes are good choices if you use a plastic bowl make sure it s non reactive anything that leaches into the water will be absorbed through the frog s skin add unchlorinated water to the bowl don t use tap water for the frog s soaking dish since they are sensitive to chlorine home filtering should remove chlorine from your water but the safer bet is to use jugs of distilled water 2 x research source fill the bowl with just enough water for the frog to submerge its entire head and body empty clean and refill the bowl every day because frogs like to lounge in their soaking bowls things like food scraps and feces will build up in the water each day dump out the water and rinse the bowl then wash the bowl with a clean rag and a very mild soap rinse away the soap fully under the faucet then give a final rinse with unchlorinated water 3 x research source after the final rinse dry the dish with a clean paper towel refill it with unchlorinated water and return it to the frog s enclosure don t try to give your frog a bath frogs are adept at self cleaning and should be left alone as much as possible handling a frog as would be necessary to bathe them causes them a great deal of stress and may expose them to bacteria or chemicals just focus on giving your frog clean water every day 4 x research source even healthy frogs can carry salmonella bacteria so you should only touch a frog when necessary keep frogs away from children under 5 because of their heightened risk of illness from exposure to salmonella 5 x research source wash your hands and put on vinyl gloves any germs chemicals oils etc on your hands will be absorbed through the frog s skin and can damage their health wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water and dry them with a clean towel after that put on a pair of sterile powder free vinyl gloves 6 x research source putting on gloves also protects you frogs even healthy ones very frequently carry salmonella bacteria on their skin place your gloved thumb just below the frog s head work calmly and move slowly so you don t frighten the frog any more than is necessary touch the tip of your thumb against the base of the frog s neck in preparation for scooping it up 7 x research source this thumb placement should be done in conjunction with the scooping procedure done with your fingers described below scoop your other fingers underneath the frog s body with your thumb in place behind the frog s head scoop your other four fingers under its body so that the frog is contained within your hand grasp only tightly enough that the frog cannot escape don t squeeze 8 x research source if the frog is too big for one hand mirror the process with your other hand as well place both thumbs on the back of the neck and scoop around each side with your hands lift carry and release the frog carefully keep your loose but secure grip on the frog as you transport it calmly but quickly to its destination when it s time to release the frog reverse the pick up process lower your holding fingers to the floor uncurl them from around the frog and lift your hand away 9 x research source the frog may squirm and try to escape so make sure you don t drop it even a short fall can be fatal to a frog the frog may urinate or defecate on you out of fear ignore this and keep transporting it carefully discard your gloves and wash your hands thoroughly as soon as you re done moving the frog peel off your gloves and throw them away inside out then wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with clean water and soap dry them with a clean towel 10 x research source children under 5 should not handle frogs even if the proper precautions are taken they re too likely to drop the frog and they re more susceptible to salmonella related illness 11 x research source test a newly captured wild frog for chytrid immediately amphibian chytrid chytridiomycosis attacks a frog s skin cells spreads rapidly from frog to frog and is often fatal all wild frogs should be immediately tested for chytrid by swabbing their sides and belly 5 times each with a sterile testing swab seal the swab in a sterile bag for testing in the lab 12 x research source wild frogs should only be captured for research purposes by trained professionals do not try to capture a wild frog to keep it as a pet it may be illegal depending on the frog type and it endangers the health of the frog and possibly you isolate the frog for 30 days as a preventative measure every newly captured wild frog should be kept in isolation from other frogs for 30 days and started on antifungal treatment even before the chytrid test results come back 13 x research source any legitimate operation that captures wild frogs for research purposes should have a dedicated isolation area for new frogs mix an antifungal bathing solution containing itraconazole combine unchlorinated water not tap water and the antifungal medication itraconazole at a dosage of 10 milligrams per milliliter of water 14 x research source you only need enough of the solution to fill a container to the point that the frog can just barely submerge itself in the liquid 15 x research source itraconazole is a prescription medication used to treat a range of fungal infections in humans pick the frog up to put it in its antifungal soak start by washing your hands and putting on vinyl gloves place your thumb just behind the frog s head then scoop your other fingers around and underneath the frog grasp it just enough to keep it from escaping wash your hands thoroughly after handling the frog 16 x research source pick up a frog only when necessary it causes them a great deal of stress and it is easy for you to transfer bacteria and illnesses back and forth let the frog soak in the solution for 10 minutes per day for 10 days carefully lower the frog into the container with the antifungal solution then release your hand from around it leave it in the antifungal container for 10 minutes then carefully return it to its isolation tank repeat this process over the following 9 days 17 x research source test the frog again and keep it in quarantine for 30 days total after the 10 days of treatment test the frog for chytrid once again keep the frog in isolation for 20 more days for a total of 30 days if the second chytrid test comes back clean the frog can be released from isolation 18 x research source if the second chytrid test comes back positive start another 10 day regimen of antifungal baths,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for a green frog,want to own a green frog here are a few steps on how to care for it,research check with your local state law to see if green frogs are legal to own finding a frog you can either go to your local pond or go to the pet store or go online and see if you could find the frog choosing a frog when you picking a frog you want to make sure that it s healthy and without any abnormal features like skinny stomachs weak legs or cloudy eyes setting up its habitat a 10 gallon 37 9 l aquarium is suitable for one or two frogs if you have more increase the tank size a half land half water set up or a terrestrial set up is good enough for the frog make sure you have a top so that the frog can t get out if you use gravel make sure it s large enough for the frog not to swallow water depth should be 3 4 inches 7 6 10 2 cm soil or sphagnum moss is suitable make sure you have a water dish large enough for the frog to soak in tadpoles can handle an aquarium filled water add hiding spaces like caves or plants for your frog tadpole you can use a fluorescent light for the frog to bask on and to get its nutrients feeding the frog live crickets mealworms earthworms and small feeder fish are a good diet for a green frog you can use vitamin d3 to powder the frog s food you can get it from your local pet store cleaning the tank when cleaning the frog s tank you want to remove the frog into a little container while you clean use 1 of bleach solution to clean the tank when pouring the dirty water out use a tank vacuum cleaner or turkey baster wash the rocks and furniture with hot water to kill the germs,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for african clawed or dwarf frogs,african clawed frogs acfs and african dwarf frogs adfs are two types of frogs that make excellent pets these two types of frogs maintain many similarities as well as some key differences by taking the time to prepare a healthy habitat providing nutritious food and most of all being able to tell the difference between these two types of frogs you can be a responsible pet owner to happy healthy frogs,remember to keep these frogs separate although the living conditions for both types are frogs are similar it is crucial for you to keep adf and acf frogs separate from one another when acfs grow to be full sized they will actually eat smaller creatures like adfs 1 x research source obtain a tank the right size the only major difference between tanks for acfs and tanks for adfs is the size of the tank and the amount of water it holds for acfs a good rule or thumb is to have ten gallons of non chlorinated water per frog for adfs the rule is to have only one gallon of non chlorinated water per frog this is quite a big difference 2 x research source 3 x research source a filtered tank is your best option you can get away with an unfiltered tank if you clean it thoroughly every two weeks be sure to secure the lid on your tank these frogs are known for trying to escape 4 x research source choose a substrate or bare bottom habitat both types of frogs enjoy either a substrate made of rocks or a bare bottom tank be sure to use rocks too large for the frogs to eat for acfs you ll want large river rocks and for adfs medium sized rocks bare bottom tanks may not be as pretty too look at but they are much easier to keep clean 5 x research source check the temperature acf and adf frogs thrive in similar temperatures when they are froglets you should aim for temperatures between 74 78f 23 25c when frogs are adults aim for temperatures between 70 75f 21 24c as long as you maintain a warm temperature in your home you should not need to use a fish tank heater although that is an option frogs can survive as long as the temperatures stay between 65f and 80f 18 and 26c supply hiding places and other décor both types of frogs need hiding places in their tanks such as terracotta pots caves driftwood and silk plants without adequate places to hide and recharge frogs can actually become stressed to the point of death 6 x research source avoid both real and plastic plants both can be toxic to these frogs stick to silk plants maintain your tank in order to keep your frog habitat healthy you will need to do some daily weekly and monthly maintenance each day you must check the filter water temperature and any other equipment each week you must check the overall water quality finally and most importantly once a month you must remove 10 25 of the total water volume and replace it with fresh water 7 x research source determine how often you should feed how often you should feed your frog will vary depending on the species acf tadpoles should be fed daily while adult acfs should be fed every 2 3 days as adf frogs are smaller in size they must eat smaller quantities of food more often both adf tadpoles and adf adults should be fed 1 2 times per day 8 x research source 9 x research source serve food the right size in general acfs and adfs can consume the same diet the only major difference is that adfs must have their food broken down into much smaller pieces for them additionally adfs will consume much smaller portions 10 x research source there is not an exact science to portion sizes for frogs start with a small amount of food at each feeding and gradually increase until you have an understanding for how much your frog likes to eat sprinkle pellet food in the tank both acfs and adfs can eat pellet food for aquatic life you can find this pellet food at any pet store pellet food is particularly important for tadpoles of either species but it should also be a staple component of adult frog diets simply sprinkle a small amount in your frog s tank at each feeding 11 x research source you will want sinking pellets do not feed your frogs flake fish food provide bloodworms brine shrimp and mysis shrimp bloodworms brine shrimp and mysis shrimp are other staples in the diets of acf and adf frogs look for these items at your local pet store you may find them fresh dried or frozen all of which are good options for your frogs if you have adf frogs be sure to break up the food into small pieces 12 x research source when using frozen food be sure to thaw beforehand understanding the size difference although acfs african clawed frogs and adfs african dwarf frogs look almost the same when they are small acfs will grow very large as they age as a result they must be kept in larger tanks and cannot be kept with small fish or frogs including adfs in short it is crucial to know if you are dealing with acf or adf frogs 13 x research source research laws in your state additionally acfs have been outlawed in some places in certain areas these frogs have gotten into the water supply and gobbled up everything in sight if you would like to keep acfs as pets be sure to research the regulations in your area 14 x research source for example acfs are currently illegal to own in california and oregon evaluate the eyes although the differences in these frogs are subtle when they are young there are a few notable characteristics you can look for the first has to do with the eyes acfs will have buggier eyes that protrude a bit while adfs will have flat eyes that do not stick out also acfs will have eyes positioned on top of their heads while adfs will have eyes on the sides of their faces 15 x research source look at the claws and webbing another way to distinguish these types of frogs from one another is to take a look at their claws acfs will have claw like front hands adfs on the other hand will have dark colored claw like back feet additionally adfs will have webbing between the fingers of all four hands whereas acfs will only have webbing on their hind legs 16 x research source 17 x research source the claws will become more defined as they age so this is not the easiest way to tell the difference in very young frogs,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for poison dart frogs,poison dart frogs are beautifully colored exotic amphibians that make very interesting pets to observe native to the tropical rain forests of south america these frogs love warm temperatures and high humidity don t be worried by their name their skin is only poisonous in the wild due to their unique insect diet there however they can be a bit tricky to care for so keep that in mind before you bring them home,choose at least a 10 us gal 38 l tank for 1 2 frogs you need to provide a safe relatively large space for these frogs to feel at home in a 10 us gal 38 l tank is a good size for 1 2 frogs for every additional frog add 10 us gal 38 l to the tank size 1 x research source you can use a fish tank but replace a screen lid with a glass or plastic one this traps in the humidity that the frogs need to thrive some frogs do better living alone while others prefer company if you re new to keeping poison dart frogs start with 1 or 2 add a substrate that holds moisture without ponding to help trap humidity in the tank start by adding a 2 in 5 1 cm bottom layer of natural aquarium pebbles then add a water permeable substrate barrier cloth followed by 2 in 5 1 cm of sphagnum moss or coconut fiber scatter some dried leaves over the top if water builds up in the pebbles you can use a turkey baster to suck it up from the corners the top layers of substrate above the pebbles will need to be replaced every 4 6 months or when you notice a foul odor or mold growth if maintaining the proper humidity isn t a problem you can simplify the substrate by using just natural aquarium pebbles and dried leaves 2 x research source install plants and hiding spots once you lay the substrate it helps the frogs feel more at home if you add plants the plants will grow into the moss or coconut fiber and help keep the terrarium humid when choosing which plants to add keep in mind they need to be rainforest native and able to handle high levels of humidity bromeliads and orchids are examples of plants that will thrive in this setting you can add fake plants as well but these won t help with maintaining the humidity provide hiding spots where the frogs can go at night or when they want to be reclusive the leaves you add on top of the soil can serve this purpose but you can also add plastic dome shaped hides and sections of cork bark 3 x research source provide daytime lighting that doesn t heat the tank obtain a uv light to set on top of the tank not a heat lamp a heat lamp will dry out the air and tank temperatures above 85 f 29 c may harm the frogs 4 x research source turn the light on during the day and off at night the uv light is beneficial for the growth of both the plants and the frogs it also allows you to spot any buildup of mold easier along with more lighting for you to view your beautiful new terrarium and frogs add a hygrometer to track humidity and a water bowl if needed to increase humidity poison dart frogs are very sensitive to the humidity level it should remain at or above 80 at all times install a hygrometer which measures relative humidity so that you can keep a close eye on the moisture content inside the enclosure 5 x research source if you keep the lid on at all times except for during feedings and mist the tank regularly with water as described in this article the humidity level should remain high enough for an additional humidity boost add a low sided bowl to the terrarium and fill it with 0 5 1 in 1 3 2 5 cm of dechlorinated water daily frogs don t need drinking water as they absorb moisture through their skin but they may soak in this dish from time to time track the temperature with a thermometer and use a heating pad if necessary as with humidity poison dart frogs are quite sensitive to air temperature the temperature inside the enclosure should stay between 74 82 f 23 28 c during the day and 65 70 f 18 21 c at night 6 x research source if you need help maintaining this temperature in the terrarium buy one or more plug in aquarium heating pads to affix to the outer back or side walls mist the terrarium daily with dechlorinated water spraying the tank regularly increases the humidity and recreates a rainforest habitat for the frogs use distilled water or add dechlorinating drops to tap water frogs in general are sensitive to chlorine fill an empty spray bottle with the water and mist the whole tank thoroughly 1 2 times per day or more depending on what is needed to maintain the humidity level 7 x research source choose a sprayer that creates a fine mist not a heavy spray the water will support any plants you ve added to the terrarium as well release springtails or isopods into the substrate soil if desired springtails are classified as hexapods and isopods are classified as crustaceans these tiny critters will help clean bacteria and stool out of the soil keeping it cleaner for longer most of the time they will form a culture that is reproduce on their own but the frogs will also eat them as snacks this is an optional step the frogs will get their main source of nutrition from the feedings of live insects you need to provide you can get live springtails and isopods delivered to you from a feeder insect retailer or you may find them at an exotic pet retailer 8 x research source clean the enclosure every 4 6 months or when needed start by moving the frogs to a temporary enclosure then empty out the tank and wash down the walls with a mild soap and dechlorinated water do the same with any hiding spots plastic plants etc rinse these with dechlorinated water and dry them replace the substrate with fresh material 9 x research source once the enclosure is returned to its ideal state you can put the frogs back in if you notice mold or mildew building up inside the enclosure or if it develops a foul odor give it a good cleaning as soon as possible obtain live flightless fruit flies or other insects for feeding poison dart frogs eat a large variety of insects in their natural habitat in captivity flightless live fruit flies should be their main diet as they are relatively easy to obtain at pet shops or online you can use isopods small crickets and even different types of tiny beetles but flightless fruit flies tend to be the easiest option 10 x research source if you want to feed the frogs live crickets order pin head or ⅛ inch 0 3 cm crickets the 2 smallest categories from a feeder insect retailer 11 x research source the frogs will manage fine on a diet made up only of fruit flies but you can add in other options every week or so to provide variety if desired with some patience and practice you can learn to culture that is raise flightless fruit flies yourself so you don t need to keep buying them talk to an exotic pet store owner or someone else who is knowledgeable on the subject add nutrients to the insects then release them into the tank add the needed amount of flightless fruit flies or alternative to a dish then sprinkle an amphibian nutrient powder available from exotic pet retailers over them as directed this will add additional beneficial nutrients like calcium then open the terrarium s lid dump the critters onto the substrate and close the lid again the frogs will likely begin feeding immediately each juvenile frog typically eats 30 flightless fruit flies at a time while an adult usually eats 50 75 12 x research source use this as a starting point if a frog finishes that amount in 5 10 minutes increase it by half or so if they don t finish within 15 minutes reduce the amount a little 13 x research source feed juvenile frogs and possibly adults daily poison dart frogs are day feeders so feed them on a fairly consistent schedule during the daytime juvenile frogs less than 6 months old should always be fed daily while some adults may manage fine being fed 3 5 times per week 14 x research source for adults use their eating habits to establish their feeding schedule if they eat well daily and appear healthy maintain the daily schedule if you don t feed daily still open the lid briefly and close it again once per day this provides enough fresh air without letting too much humidity escape do not try to play with them unlike other exotic pets such as reptiles or tarantulas you should not try to hold poison dart frogs unnecessarily they are very small and sensitive so they should be kept inside their tank as much as possible if you are looking for a playful interactive pet these aren t the amphibians for you they are more of a museum pet which means they should be left alone and just observed 15 x research source don t be discouraged though this doesn t make owning them any less fun they are very active especially during feeding time handle poison dart frogs only when you must move them you should only handle them when you are remodeling or cleaning their tank or when moving them to another tank when you do so place your thumb on the back of the frog s neck and use your fingers to scoop it up into a loose but secure grasp 16 x research source temporarily move them to a container that is set up similarly to their main terrarium and at least 12 in 12 in 30 cm 30 cm in size if they ll be in the temporary home for more than a few hours you ll need to make sure the humidity and temperature are closely maintained wash your hands before and after handling the frogs it s also a good idea to wear latex gloves although these frogs are not poisonous in captivity there s a miniscule chance that their skin may still secrete a minute amount of poison more importantly though you don t want to transfer any bacteria or chemicals from hand creams etc back and forth frogs absorb things readily through their skin and are very sensitive 17 x research source even healthy frogs can carry bacteria like salmonella which can be particularly dangerous for children under 5 and other high risk individuals young children should never handle any type of frog 18 x research source acquire 1 2 captive bred juvenile frogs from a reliable vendor any captive bred poison dart frog will be non poisonous but you ll have a better chance of getting a healthy and happy frog from an established reliable vendor ask friends who have exotic amphibians for referrals or talk to owners of exotic pet stores in your area 19 x research source juvenile frogs 3 5 months of age are easier to acclimate to a new setting than either babies or adults in most cases they ll be around 1 in 2 5 cm long at this stage there are many different species of poison dart frogs and it s best to house ones from the same species together they ll be more similar in size and temperament 20 x research source set up a temporary home in a lidded roomy container for the first 6 weeks the 1 2 juveniles you ve acquired should be kept separate from any other frogs you can use an aquarium for a temporary home but a 12 in 12 in 30 cm 30 cm or larger translucent plastic storage container with a lid can also do the job 21 x research source add substrate and maintain the heat and humidity levels as you do with the main terrarium this temporary home helps the frogs adjust to a new setting and gives you time to make sure they are healthy and disease free observe the frogs appearance and habits for signs of trouble frog skin can reveal quite a bit about the animal s health if a poison dart frog develops new spotting or color patterns along with increased mucus production from the skin it may have absorbed a toxin discoloration especially reddening of lighter colored areas of the skin such as the legs or abdomen may also indicate a bacterial viral or fungal infection 22 x research source look for behavioral changes along with changes in appearance if a frog becomes more lethargic or shows changes in its eating or waste production habits there s a good chance something is wrong if you suspect any type of illness in a frog keep it isolated and contact a reptile veterinarian for guidance some amphibian infections can be treated while others are nearly always fatal care for the frogs separately for 6 weeks before relocating them care for the separate juveniles in the same way you care for any adults you already have feed them daily keep a close eye on the humidity and temperature and don t touch or bother them unless you really have to just enjoy watching them grow 23 x research source after 6 weeks you can pick them up and put them in the main terrarium if the existing frogs don t accept their new roommates within a few days that is they are territorial and aggressive towards them you may need to set up separate terrariums,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for a striped marsh frog,striped marsh frogs are a species of small frog from australia that are commonly kept as pets they are easy to care for and can live for about 5 years in captivity making them a great beginner species of pet frog the frogs themselves are green in color and have white spots spread out across their back to care for a marsh frog you ll need to provide an adequate tank substrate and water the frogs exclusively eat live insects which you ll need to dust with a vitamin coating before giving them to your frog you can purchase all of the necessary housing and feeding supplies at a local pet store,select a glass tank with a divided base for your marsh frog a 30 12 12 in 76 30 30 cm aquarium will easily hold up to 4 of these frogs if you re only keeping 1 marsh frog you can use a smaller tank that s about 24 13 13 in 61 33 33 cm the enclosure must be waterproof escape proof and non toxic 1 x research source make sure that the tank has 1 elevated side to create 2 sections a higher section for substrate and a lower section for water these 2 sections are typically the same size with the substrate half elevated by 2 3 inches 5 1 7 6 cm in most divided tanks the substrate will taper down as it approaches the low side of the tank a 30 12 12 in 76 30 30 cm long tank is a standard medium sized aquarium the size is referred to as a 30 long and pet store owners will know what you re referring to if you use that term to keep frogs from getting out and unwanted insects from getting in pick up a steel or aluminum flyscreen to rest on top of the tank striped marsh frogs can jump quite high to prevent frog escapes tape down any loose non locking lids although striped marsh frogs get along well with other frogs of the same species it s unwise to keep them in the same tank as frogs of different species also avoid keeping fish in the water half of the frog tank since the frogs will eat them cover half the bottom of the tank in 3 in 7 6 cm of substrate on the elevated side of the bottom of the tank lay down a layer of well draining substrate like peat or rain forest bedding to provide a moist land area for your frog lay the substrate only on the elevated side of the divided cage this will more or less replicate the type of soil they d be walking on in their natural environment the land area should be well drained and kept moist 2 x research source purchase palm peat at your local pet store or in large dried out blocks from the gardening section of a plant nursery plant 3 4 humidity tolerant plants in the substrate plants will improve the look of the tank and will help your marsh frog feel comfortable and at home visit a nursery or pet store and search for plants that are native to humid regions and do well with relatively low light plants that typically thrive in these conditions include orchids bromeliads ficus mondo grass and types of moss 3 x research source avoid planting calla lilies or oleander as these plants are poisonous to frogs 4 x research source if you prefer not to have to care for and water the plants in the frog terrarium purchase plastic plants from a pet store instead provide dechlorinated water so the frog can swim in its tank frogs are amphibious animals and need constant access to a body of water fill the lower side of the divided tank with room temperature dechlorinated water the water should be at least 2 in 5 1 cm deep change this water at least twice a week by siphoning out old water and adding new water replace 100 of the water each time you change it 5 x research source striped marsh frogs do not like currents in the water that they lay in so don t install a water filter set 3 4 stones and other resting places in the water and a ramp up to the land area of the tank you can purchase plastic resting decorations and a plastic ramp at any large pet store install 3 6 small hiding places for your frog to conceal itself behind frogs like hiding places so set half a dozen small rocks leaf litter and logs across the substrate purchase objects in a variety of sizes so your frog can hide near those it likes best for example choose a 2 in 4 in 5 1 cm 10 2 cm log and a 5 in 5 in 13 cm 13 cm rock these objects will help recreate the frog s natural habitat and will give it places to sleep digest its food and get out of the light if it begins to overheat you can purchase plastic versions of all of these objects at a large pet store they ll most likely be in the aquarium section locate the frog tank in a cool part of your home marsh frogs can tolerate a range of temperatures and in most cases don t need to be heated the temperature in the tank should not drop below 46 f 8 c and not go above 77 f 25 c ideally the temperature in the tank should hover around 59 68 f 15 20 c 6 x research source if the temperature in the tank slips below 46 f 8 c in the winter clip a heat lamp on to the side of the tank direct the heat towards a patch of substrate so the frog can lie there and warm up it s unlikely that the water will reach a temperature that s too high or too low for the frogs even when the tank is heated however to avoid the risk of overheating don t set the tank in an area that receives direct sunlight for more than 1 2 hours light the frog tank for at least 6 8 hours a day when setting up the tank purchase a fluorescent light that either clips on to the top of the tank or rests over the enclosure as part of an add on roof keep the fluorescent light on for at least 6 8 hours of the day if you d rather not have to remember to regularly turn the light on and off purchase a timer and set it so that the light is on during regular daylight hours 7 x research source unlike various other types of frogs and amphibians kept in captivity striped marsh frogs do not need special uv lighting rinse the substrate 2 3 times per week to keep it clean and moist if the substrate is left for too long unhealthy bacteria will build up to keep the substrate clean pour 1 litre 0 26 us gal of water over it 2 3 times a week you don t need to remove the substrate from the tank in order to do this since the water will drain through the substrate 8 x research source if you maintain the substrate you won t need to replace it more than 2 times a year plan to change the substrate for example once in spring and once in fall even if you don t note any visual differences at these times spray the plants and substrate with water 3 4 times weekly in order to keep the humidity high in the frog s tank and to prevent the soil from drying out spray water over the interior of the tank using an ordinary spray bottle 9 x research source spritz the substrate and plants half a dozen times with dechlorinated water but avoid spraying water directly onto the frog also take the time to spray the substrate in your tank each time that you change out the water clean the tank twice each month with warm tap water remove all of the items from your frog s tank including any plastic plants and objects stones etc and run them under warm tap water scrub the items with a sponge to remove bacteria and residue then use the same sponge to wipe down the inner walls of the frog s tank avoid using cleaning products even mild ones as they can irritate the frog s sensitive skin 10 x research source if you re concerned that your frog may try to escape as you clean its tank place it into a smaller backup tank without substrate and water the frog will be fine in this tank during the 20 30 minutes it ll take you to clean the main tank dust insects with a vitamin mixture before feeding your frog when kept in captivity frogs aren t able to produce calcium and other healthy compounds on their own so before feeding your frog each day place 5 10 insects in a plastic bag dump in 1 small spoonful each of multivitamin powder and calcium powder then shake the bag for 30 seconds until the insects are fully coated 11 x research source purchase live insects calcium powder and multivitamin powder at a local pet store most pet stores sell mixtures of vitamins that have been specifically designed to provide the nutrients that frogs need since their dietary needs may be different than those of reptiles and other amphibians if you d rather not dust the insects yourself most pet stores will have a bin of live insects that have already been dusted with a powder containing calcium and other vitamins and nutrients keep food constantly available for juvenile marsh frogs juvenile marsh frogs eat frequently and have large appetites since their bodies are still growing so keep insects constantly available for a juvenile frog to eat check the tank 4 5 times daily to make sure that there are insects inside from the previous feeding and if there are not deposit 6 7 insects on the substrate suitable foods for young frogs include small insects like crickets house flies and fruit flies 12 x research source marsh frogs are considered juvenile until they reach sexual maturity at 5 months of age make sure to always dust the insects with calcium and vitamin powders before feeding your juvenile frogs feed a mature marsh frog insects 2 or 3 times a week frogs older than 5 months will eat large meals every 3 or 4 days so each time you feed your marsh frog give it 12 15 insects and adjust the amount you feed once you get a sense of the frog s appetite do this 2 3 times a week older frogs have a habit of eating anything they can fit in their mouths so you can give them fairly large insects e g grasshoppers or cockroaches to eat 13 x research source you can purchase live insects and other frog friendly foods at a local pet store at the end of each day remember to remove all dead food from the tank otherwise it will begin to decay or may attract unwanted insects use a pair of tweezers to feed insects to a mature frog to feed a mature marsh frog pick up each individual insect with a pair of tweezers take the top off of the frog enclosure and lower the insect towards the waiting frog try placing each insect directly into the frog s mouth or onto the ground 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm away 14 x research source since they ll be preoccupied with eating the insects your marsh frogs shouldn t try to escape the tank while you re feeding them you can try to feed your juvenile frogs in the same way however since they need a constant food supply it may be more practical to deposit 6 7 insects in the tank all at once,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for a glass frog centrolene prosoblepon,the northern glass frog or fleischmann s glass frog is a small tree frog that averages between three quarters of an inch to one and a half inches 20 32 mm in length the name glass frog is derived from the white translucent skin on its belly where the frog s beating heart and other organs are visible read on to learn how to care for these unique creatures,provide a stable living environment considering that glass frogs are typically arboreal in nature they need an enclosure that provides more vertical than horizontal real estate they need plenty of branches and vines to scale and preferably a nice cork background the size of enclosure is the standard 10 gallons 37 liters per inch 2 5 cm of frog some find this a bit extreme but they love to explore the more room you give them the happier they will be use forest floor sold in dried bricks and have about 2 5cm of soil for the floor of the enclosure forest floor holds humidity longer and allows for coprophagous insects to develop and help break down any missed fecal matter this is essential to help with the ecosystem of your enclosure provide plenty of live broad leaf plants like pothos and other philodendrons pillow moss or bromeliads jungle moss sold in bricks is good to disperse about too however pillow moss may be preferable as it tends to feast upon frog excrement considering it s living moss be sure to keep either a large shallow bowl of distilled or ro reverse osmosis water or create a waterfall pool for the frogs just be sure to provide the frogs with multiple easy escapes from the water they aren t good swimmers and can easily drown water should be kept clean and changed daily or as needed frogs tend to like to eliminate their bowels in water keep the humidity high 90 or higher is ideal provide enough ventilation though to allow fresh air to constantly enter but be careful not to over dry the enclosure an ecosystem that is too arid can be as harmful as one with stagnant humid air the vivarium should always smell humid and fresh like fresh damp soil provide a source of light with the appropriate spectrum and intensity for all the live plant specimens if you choose not to use live plants be sure to allow dim to moderate lighting to help keep the frogs on their normal photoperiod typically this means 12 hours on and 12 hours off the use of an automatic timer is nice too especially for waterfall systems keep the temperature stable average temperature in the enclosure should fall between 76ºf and 82ºf 24ºc 27ºc during the day with a drop to 68ºf 72ºf 20ºc 22ºc at night provide a wide variety in the diet for optimal health crickets drosophilidae flies flightless fruit flies newly born soldier fly larvae red wiggler worms only the smallest you can buy newly born dubia roaches are good too supplement their diet with vitamin powder calcium powder mineral powder v c m simply lightly dust the food items before each feeding with my foolproof method of v c m 2 days off in this formula you supplement day one day two day three then you give two days off and repeat feed juveniles once a day feed adults every other day give them enough to fill their stomachs but not bloat themselves best practice is to feed about 30 minutes or so after the light shuts off spot clean the enclosure as needed fully clean the enclosure once a month unless it s a full living vivarium then you should only have to spot clean daily never use chemicals only water and a drop or two of bleach just be sure to get every bit of the bleach out even a faint scent of bleach can be a lethal amount to absorb,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for an ornate horned frog,the ornate horned frog ceratophrys ornata is a large carnivorous frog they re called horned frogs because they have little fleshy points over their eyes that look like horns they are often referred to as pac man frogs because when they lunge at their prey they appear to be all mouth ornate horned frogs are usually the size of a silver dollar when purchased but they can grow as large as 6 inches within 5 months,buy from a reputable pet store if you can visit a couple of different pet stores before you decide on a frog stores have different quality standards of care so some stores will have healthier frogs than others buy the healthiest most robust specimen you can find it will be easier to care for and is likely to live longer 1 x research source only buy a frog if its tank is clean with no feces floating in the water poor sanitary conditions lead to sick frogs look for a healthy clear skin skin that appears clouded may be a sign of illness a milky or cloudy looking skin might simply be a sign of recent shedding as these frogs shed and eat their skin periodically but to be on the safe side start with a clear skinned frog 2 x research source ornate horned frogs are usually medium to dark green or yellow in color with patches of red and black cranwell s horned frogs a specialized variety bred in captivity can also be brown beige orange yellow and even albino choose a lively animated specimen approach the frogs and pass your hand near them in front or on top of the tank a healthy frog will react by rapidly moving the sac under its mouth and may make a mooing sound if you don t get a reaction the frog is probably unhealthy 3 x research source look for frogs that seem alert and have clear bright eyes wear gloves when you handle your frog a frog s skin is a delicate membrane that acts as a secondary breathing organ the oils on human skin can be harmful or even toxic to a frog s skin pet frogs are for looking at they don t want human love or affection frogs don t like to be held and will sometimes make loud distress calls to let you know they are upset ornate horned frogs will try to eat anything that comes near their mouth and they will bite your finger always buy captive bred cb frogs wild caught wc frogs are unsuited to captivity and suffer from stress therefore it is considered cruel to keep them wild caught frogs often carry parasites or diseases which will infect your other frogs wild caught frogs are often old so you won t have as much time to enjoy your frog keep only one frog in the tank most frogs are cannibalistic large frogs often eat smaller frogs it s dangerous to put more than one ornate horned frog in the same tank one is very likely to eat the other especially if they are different sizes 4 x research source never mix different types of frogs in one tank as each species of frog has its own particular care needs buy a 10 gallon glass aquarium ornate horned frogs are native to tropical and mountain rain forests so they need an aquatic terrestrial habitat glass aquariums are easy to clean and you can watch your frogs through the glass 5 x research source these frogs aren t jumpers so you don t strictly need a screened lid on top however a lid is still a good idea because it helps keep the tank warm provide a deep substrate for your frog to burrow in your frog feeds by ambushing its food meaning it will hide in the deep substrate until prey comes near then jump out and attack be sure the substrate is slightly moist at all times never soggy or completely dry 6 x research source good substrate materials include coconut husk fiber bed a beast eco earth forest bed or similar products soil is a good option because it stays moist and allows your frog to dig it looks natural as well be sure to purchase safe soil that does not contain pesticides vermiculite perlite or any other harmful chemicals cypress mulch sphagnum moss and leaf litter are not generally recommended because your frog can choke on a piece of bark or moss if you use these items you ll need to feed using tweezers or tongs never use sand gravel or fir bark as substrate provide a water bowl add a large shallow bowl to the tank which should be filled with water at all times always use de chlorinated water tap water will harm your frog 7 x research source glazed ceramic trays that come with flowerpots make excellent water dishes most frogs defecate into their water dish so be sure to replace the water at least daily place little stacks of rocks next to the bowl and in the water so your young frog can climb in and out add foliage for decoration horned frogs don t need foliage to hide because they burrow into the deep substrate on the bottom of the tank but you can add artificial or real plants if you want to make the tank look nice real plants can be difficult to grow indoors and will need to be thoroughly washed and disinfected before you add them to the terrarium artificial plants are easier to keep clean and you can buy a wide variety of these online or at a pet store air plants are living plants that do not require soil or water apart from an occasional misting keep them away from harsh sunlight and heat lamps or they will dry out 8 x research source add a heat source position a low intensity 15 watts heat lamp over the terrarium above the highest point in your frog s habitat be sure there is a screen lid to the tank between your frog and the heating bulb 9 x research source don t use under tank heaters or heated rocks in your ornate horned frog tank moderate tank temperature horned frogs will thrive in a fairly large range of temperatures and do not require careful humidity adjustments like most amphibians their tank should be between 75 f 24 c and 84 f 29 c during the day and a few degrees cooler at night 10 x research source hang store bought temperature strips on the side of the tank to measure environmental conditions feed your growing frog insects and worms juvenile horned frogs will enjoy small earthworms crickets and wax worms they need to eat live prey so this may not be the pet for you if you are squeamish 11 x research source feed juveniles 2 6 food items at least 2 3 times per week feed your adult frog larger prey items adult horned frogs can handle larger foods such as night crawlers roaches superworms silkworms earthworms locusts crickets mealworms feeder fish slugs and snails 12 x research source adults can be feed once per week or even once every two weeks if you provide large quantities of food items during aestivation periods adult horned frogs will go as long as four months without food if fed heavily beforehand you can feed pre killed pinky or larger mice to your frog occasionally but they should not be a regular part of your frog s diet do not feed your frog live mice or other vertebrates supplement their diet in addition to a well rounded diet rub calcium and vitamin d3 supplement powder onto their food you can purchase amphibian vitamin supplements online or at your local pet store 13 x research source juvenile horned frogs should get supplement powder at least 2 3 times per week adult frogs should get vitamin dusted meals at least once per week watch your fingers ornate horned frogs are not picky eaters and they will bite anything you put near their mouth including your finger although they don t have teeth to speak of they have strong jaws and their bite can be very painful 14 x research source if your frog bites you resist the urge to jerk away you may accidentally fling your frog across the room and injure him if your frog does not let go within a few seconds try running cold water over him until he releases his grip clean your finger with antiseptic and apply a bandage keep the tank clean once a month remove your frog from its tank and place it in a small holding tank thoroughly wash all surfaces with hot water wash the items in the tank with hot water as well and let everything cool before you put it back 15 x research source use gloves when moving your frog to a holding tank the natural oils in your skin are very harmful to frogs never use chemicals

how to spot a bull frog,bullfrogs are amphibians that live in marshlands ponds and creeks with little current they have excellent camouflage to evade predators and so can be difficult to spot here are some steps and tips to help you find these elusive creatures,look for suitable habitat where you can expect bullfrogs to live there should be clean water with little or no current and sufficient aquatic vegetation to offer them concealment choose the proper season for searching for bullfrogs they are amphibians and so are cold blooded creatures which are only active in warm weather from spring through early fall breeding season is usually late spring to early summer and males can make considerable noise during this time consider looking late in the evening or after dark since bullfrog s large eyes are reflective and are more easily spotted than their bodies travel the banks of the body of water you are searching quietly and slowly so the bullfrogs do not startle them and cause them to leap into the water stop and scan the water s edge frequently looking for the glossy skin of the bullfrog also be aware of their distinctive profile against the similarly colored background where they await prey listen for their distinctive call or croaks to help you locate the general area bullfrogs are in,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for a fire bellied toad bombina orientalis,despite their name fire bellied toads are actually frogs native to korea northeast china and southeast russia fire bellies are common amphibious pets that are ideal for the beginning herpetologist their environmental needs are minimal compared to other amphibians generally fire bellied toads are hardy and easy to care for unlike most other amphibians fire bellies are active during the day making them exciting creatures for younger keepers to watch 1 x research source,get a 10 to 15 gallon 38 to 57 liter aquarium an aquarium or other container of similar size provides enough space for 2 or 3 toads make sure the enclosure has enough floor space for you to include land and water areas for these semi aquatic creatures 2 x research source while an aquarium may be better for you if you plan on watching your fire bellied toads a container with opaque sides may be less stressful for the animals fire bellies like to jump so make sure whatever enclosure you get has a lid to keep them from getting out plastic or wire mesh is fine treat water with an aquarium additive a day in advance if you re using tap water use a water conditioner or aquarium additive to remove chlorine and other chemicals from the water that may harm your toad leave the water sitting for 24 hours at room temperature before you introduce it to your toad s enclosure 3 x research source if you don t want to go through the trouble of conditioning tap water you can also use bottled spring water however don t use distilled water it lacks minerals that fire bellied toads need 4 x research source line your land area with 3 to 4 inches 7 6 to 10 2 cm of topsoil fire bellied toads are semi aquatic so they need both land and water plan for the land area to cover at least half of the enclosure s floor space use clean bagged topsoil with no additives fertilizers and other additives can harm fire bellied toads add cork bark to separate the substrate from the water 5 x research source you can find substrate materials at any garden store some exotic pet stores may also have substrate materials packaged specifically for use in amphibian enclosures topsoil provides a more natural look for the enclosure and won t harm your fire bellies if they accidentally ingest some of it along with their food some fire bellies also like to burrow in the soil to hide sheet moss and java moss also make good substrates if you plan on growing live plants in the enclosure you might need deeper substrate depending on the needs of the plants use bark stones and driftwood to create variation in your land area exotic pet stores have various items you can use to decorate the land area of your toad s enclosure choose items that look interesting to you and will provide different levels and hiding spaces in the land area 6 x research source your fire bellied toad s enclosure can be as simple or as fancy as you like at a minimum your toad needs high and low areas a slope into the water and areas of cover where it can hide pour 1 to 2 inches 2 5 to 5 1 cm of treated water into the water area place river stones throughout the water area to create shallow places despite being semi aquatic creates fire bellies don t like to be submerged in water and aren t really fond of swimming 7 x research source use stones or moss around the edge of the water area to create a gentle slope into the water so that your toad can easily get in and out add pieces of driftwood or river rocks to the water particularly in the deepest parts so that your toad can rest if it wants add water plants to give your toad some shelter you can grow floating vegetation such as amazon frogbit and giant salvinia on the surface of the water to give your toad cover as it moves through the water aquatic plants such as ferns also add a natural touch to the enclosure and help keep the water clean 8 x research source you can increase the depth of your water as needed to accommodate the water plants just make sure you have some shallower areas as well as plenty of rocks or driftwood for your toad to land on in deeper water fire bellies also like to dig so make sure aquatic plants are at a depth that will prevent them from being uprooted 9 x research source create a hide box so your toad feels secure any object such as a broken flower pot large pieces of driftwood or another container can be used as a hide box where your toad can go when it feels threatened in addition to the larger hide box include plenty of covered areas throughout the enclosure where your toad can seek shelter 10 x research source overhanging stones plants and driftwood all create hiding places as well as adding interesting features to the enclosure if you have multiple fire bellies make sure you have enough hiding places that each of them can hide securely at the same time monitor the temperature in the enclosure and adjust as necessary fire bellied toads are comfortable at room temperature so you might not need to make much adjustment your fire bellies will be just fine with a temperature range between 65 and 78 f 18 and 26 c 11 x research source place a thermometer in the enclosure to monitor the temperature fire bellied toads are in danger if the temperature rises to 82 f 28 c they ll be okay in temperatures as low as 50 f 10 c but it s still a good idea to place the enclosure away from any windows or drafty areas maintain 50 to 70 percent humidity proper humidity is perhaps the most important condition for the well being of your fire bellies monitor humidity with a hygrometer and use a hydrostat to maintain the correct moisture level in the enclosure these tools are available at exotic pet stores 12 x research source keeping the substrate damp and using misters can help keep proper humidity levels make sure any water used in misters or foggers has been conditioned with an aquarium conditioner or additive unless you re using bottled spring water use an ultraviolet light to provide 10 hours of light each day fire bellied toads have a light cycle requiring around 10 hours of light and 14 hours of darkness in a 24 hour period an ultraviolet light can help you maintain the correct light balance 13 x research source many ultraviolet lights can be set up on a timer so you can maintain the same light cycle for your fire bellies every day without having to manually turn the light on and off provide daily feedings of live crickets for the first year like most amphibians fire bellied toads only recognize live prey live crickets which you can purchase at any pet store or feed store make up the bulk of their diet you can supplement with wax worms earthworms and similar food items 14 x research source for young fire bellies feed them as much as they can eat in 10 or 15 minutes this typically amounts to between 2 and 6 crickets 15 x research source give adult fire bellied toads live crickets every 2 or 3 days once your fire bellied toads have reached maturity continue to feed them the same amount however decrease their feedings from daily to once every 2 or 3 days 16 x research source for most adult fire bellied toads this amounts to between 2 and 6 live food items at each feeding add reptile vitamin and mineral supplements once every 2 to 4 feedings buy reptile vitamins and mineral supplements of high quality from a local exotic pet store or online to use it cover the crickets or other live food with the supplement before feeding 17 x research source in your toad s first year give it supplements with every other feeding if you re unsure about the quality of supplements ask your exotic pet veterinarian what brands they recommend remove uneaten food or dead food items immediately both dead and living crickets and other food items can potentially foul the water and cause an imbalance in your toad s habitat when it s clear that your fire bellies are done eating promptly remove the leftovers and discard them 18 x research source always wear gloves when reaching inside the toad s enclosure and wash your hands immediately after disposing of the leftovers spot clean the substrate daily to remove waste and fungus each day look over the substrate and remove anything that looks dirty or scummy if fungus is starting to grow remove the fungus and the substrate immediately around it and replace 19 x research source gently swirl the soil around with a finger to make sure there aren t any contaminants hiding below the surface always wear gloves as the oils on your hands can harm your fire bellies if more extensive cleaning is required you may want to remove your fire bellies from the enclosure first place them in a bucket or plastic container make sure there s a properly ventilated lid so they don t jump out change the water when it becomes murky or soiled how often you need to change the water depends on the size of your set up and the number of fire bellies you have if the water in your enclosure consists of a small dish of water change it every day larger water areas may only need to be changed weekly 20 x research source if you have an aquarium filter for your water you likely only need to change it once every other week however even if you have a filter you should still monitor the water quality daily and remove waste and other contaminants sprinkle water on the substrate once or twice a week use water that has been conditioned and left out at room temperature for 24 hours or get bottled spring water moisten the substrate so that it s damp 21 x research source check the moisture of the substrate before adding more water don t allow it to become soggy or water logged if you are using river stones instead of substrate simply spray them down with water so that the stones are damp you shouldn t have any pooling water on or between stones unless the stones are at the edge of the water area use hot water to clean the enclosure when necessary if the sides of the enclosure need cleaning remove everything from the enclosure including the toads then wipe it down with hot water only do not use soap disinfectants or other cleaners as they could harm your toads 22 x research source clean any features in the enclosure with hot water as well throw out the old substrate and replace it with new substrate when you return everything to the clean

aquatic tank you should use an aquarium to house your sal in layer the bottom of the tank with two inches of washed aquarium gravel gradually slope the tank so that the layered gravel goes from two inches to three inches deep plant some aquatic plants but know that you will have to replace them every so often because salamanders can be rough on aquatic plants semi aquatic tank divide your tank with a half sheet of plexiglass so that one side is aquatic and one side is terrestrial lay two inches of aquarium gravel on the aquatic side along with some aquatic plants create a sloping gradient with the gravel so that the salamander can walk from the water to the land on the land side place two inches of aquarium gravel then top it with substrate ground covering this substrate should be mulch like soil like shredded bark or coconut fiber top this with sterile potting soil or garden loam terrestrial tank do the same as the land side of the semi aquatic tank only throughout the whole tank add plants moss and a log provide your terrestrial salamander with a water bowl you will want to keep this dish relatively small and shallow as terrestrial salamanders tend to not be very good swimmers and some could even drown in a deep water bowl add some hiding places no matter what type of salamander you have you should provide them with some good hiding places salamanders can get

live like it would out in the wild 3 x research source give your sal the temperature they want the temperature you set up will depend on the type of sal you have salamanders from temperate climates like the tiger salamander will not need any form of heating sals from tropical and semi tropical locales will need heat ask your pet store or run an internet search on what temperatures your sal should be exposed to always provide a temperature gradient one side of the tank should be warmer than the other side to give them the heat they like use one of the following 4 x research source aquarium water heater these are submersible heaters that will warm the temperature of the water and increase the humidity in the tank heating pad this can be placed under one side of the tank heat lamp you should monitor these because they may kill the plants in your tank you will also have to regulate how hot the heat lamp makes the tank provide your salamander with filtered water you will have to regularly filter your salamander s water you can purchase a recirculating water filter or set up your filter in some other way 5 x research source give your terrestrial salamanders filtered water you can give them tap water that has been treated to remove chlorine and chloramine you can also use bottled spring water do not handle your salamander despite the fact that their cute little faces might inspire you to want to pick them up you should try to avoid handling your salamander the oils on human hands can actually make salamanders sick in turn salamanders can also carry or make secretions that can make people sick so it is best for everyone involved if you simply watch your sal rather than handle them 6 x research source if you do have to handle a sal like when picking one out or if yours is injured wash your hands with very hot soapy water take care to rinse off all of the soap allow your salamander to hibernate sals from cooler climates bury themselves underground for the winter months while it may be a bummer to have an empty tank sitting around if salamanders don t hibernate they generally die at a younger age 7 x research source know that salamanders are

local county extension to help identify salamanders in your local area some facts to know about salamanders you should learn are they are completely harmless to people and plants most don t grow beyond 6 inches they are smooth skinned they live in moist places like under rocks logs and in mulch 5 x research source healthy salamanders will be skittish around humans 6 x research source collect trapping equipment it can be fairly easy to trap salamanders in ponds or near other bodies of water by putting together trapping materials before you start you can effectively catch your salamander s you ll need the following items 24 ft of 18 inch wide aluminum window screening or 15 ft of 28 inch wide screening for the cylinders 15 ft of 36 inch wide fiberglass screening for the funnels 25 ft of string or small rope for the handles utility knife and scissors for cutting the screen and rope stapler with 1000 staples a small fish net if you want to catch or other container such as a jar with some water in it make sure it has holes in the lid so the salamander can breathe a glow stick or outdoor light bulb which studies have shown can be an effective bait for trapping amphibians 7 x research source construct a funnel trap although you can purchase commercially made funnel traps for salamanders they may not be as effective as traps you make yourself using the material you gathered put together your funnel trap and place it in the water to catch your new pets cut a rectangular piece of aluminum window screening using the scissors or utility knife for the cylinders roll the cut piece of screening into a cylinder 18 long and 8 in diameter leave a 1 lip on the top of the cylinder by holding the 18 end and rolling it towards the other end staple the 1 screening lip along the base of the lip where it meets the cylinder screening to hold the cylinder and lip together cut out two funnels from the fiberglass screening with a 9 opening on the wide end and 1 ¾ opening on the narrow end of each piece roll the wide ends of the funnels over the outside edges of the cylinder and staple every ½ with the stapler attach a 30 string handle to the lip and attach it with duct tape to both ends of the 1 aluminum lip place the funnel trap in the salamander s habitat most salamanders live and breed near water because their skin requires moisture 8 x research source where you place your funnel trap will depend on the time of year since many salamanders burrow in the winter 9 x research source find a stagnant or non flowing water source like a swamp pond or vernal pool 10 x research source place the trap near the bottom of a pond in the winter 11 x research source put the trap by burrows and wooded areas in the late spring and early summer make sure these are close to stagnant bodies of water as well 12 x research source check your traps within twenty four hours of setting your traps see if you ve caught any salamanders you may also capture species other than salamanders and can return these to the wild if the trap is empty leave it in place and continue to check until you find a salamander take a plastic bag or jar with pinholes or a bucket of water to catch and transfer your salamander to its new habitat net a salamander if you choose to actively net a salamander instead of using funnel traps find them in the same places where you would set traps consider using a glow stick to attract salamanders into your net 13 x research source wear a pair of waders or tall water proof pants so you can walk out into water sweep the net through the water by holding the net from the handle run the net hoop first through the water down angled into the muck at the bottom of the pond or stream observe the salamander s health when you catch a salamander check its health before you take it home to its new habitat this can ensure that it doesn t die or introduce diseases to a currently salamander colony you have 14 x research source the following traits indicate a healthy salamander plump but not bloated no visible bones in the rib abdominal or hip area clear skin with no cuts scratches or discolored patches clear and alert eyes no secretions or inflammation 15 x research source quarantine new animals if you have an established colony of salamanders quarantine your new animals for a few weeks this can ensure that they are healthy and don t wipe out any other animals with disease 16 x research source be aware that fungal infections are very common in salamanders and often fatal 17 x research source keep quarantined animals in buckets or ideally in separate aquariums 18 x research source avoid handling salamanders as adorable as salamanders are it is very important to not handle them unless absolutely necessary such as transferring the animal to its new habitat secretions salt and heat from human skin or substances on it can harm salamanders 19 x research source wash your hands in hot and soapy water before handing the salamander 20 x research source make sure to remove any soap residue from your skin so you don t harm your salamander 21 x research source transferring or touching your salamander with a small net is the best way to not harm it 22 x research source transfer your salamander to her new habitat once you ve checked the health of your salamander you are ready to move her to her new habitat giving her a

how to feed a salamander,salamanders are fun and unique pets that are really cute and relatively easy to take care of feeding them is a pretty simple task once you figure out how salamanders eat to feed a salamander choose live bugs and invertebrates and feed them every few days,feed land dwelling salamanders bugs salamanders who live on land thrive off of a diet of worms and bugs you don t have to go out into your yard and search for these bugs though this salamander food can be found at most pet stores 1 x research source for example though you might find it gross your salamander will enjoy eating crickets earthworms meal worms maggots buffalo worms and mosquito larvae this sort of food provides plenty of nutrition for your salamander feed aquatic salamanders water organisms regular bugs just won t cut it for a water dwelling salamander they eat things that swim around in the water like shrimp you can also get these foods at a pet store you may also be able to purchase them at tackle shops 2 x research source brine shrimp is the most common food for an aquatic salamander they also enjoy small fish like minnows other types of shrimp like ghost shrimp and crayfish nightcrawlers and worms like earthworms and blackworms choose appropriately sized food if you have a small species of salamander or a juvenile you should feed them smaller bugs their mouths are too small to eat large bugs go for small foods like fruit flies small grubs small crickets and worms cut into smaller pieces 3 x research source avoid feeding small salamanders large bugs only feed larger bugs to larger salamanders feed the salamander live foods most salamanders prefer to hunt for live food instead of eating dead food this means you should feed your salamander live worms bugs and shrimp instead of dead ones 4 x research source fire salamanders are a unique species and do like dead food so you can feed them chopped up bits of worms they can even be fed from trays 5 x research source avoid wild caught food some people will go outside and get bugs to feed their salamander however this can pose risks for your salamander the bugs you catch may have diseases or have been exposed to chemicals 6 x research source get your food from pet stores bait shops and dealers who sell live food do not try to feed your salamander any human foods your salamander will not see any kind of meat vegetables or fruit you try to feed it as food and even if it did try to eat it it would not be able to digest it only choose foods that you can find in their natural habitats all bugs and small invertebrates make yummy meals for your salamander feed salamanders a few times a week you don t have to feed salamanders every day many adult salamanders can be fed two to three times each week 7 x research source you can look up your particular species of salamander to determine exactly how many times each week they should be fed even better you might consult with a reptile veterinarian or a local herpetological society for some advice particularly if you are having any problems give enough food for one sitting salamanders should have just enough food that they can eat in one sitting roughly they should be able to eat this food in 15 to 20 minutes 8 x research source watch your salamander to figure out how much they can eat in that time period after a few feedings you will figure out how much to feed them 9 x research source if your salamander starts to get fat you can feed them less if they are leaving food feed less next time sprinkle the food with supplements each week you can help keep your salamander healthy and looking great by giving them supplements in their food they should have a calcium supplement every time you feed them and a multi vitamin once or twice each week 10 x research source you can buy these supplements at pet stores or online vary the diet salamanders don t need to eat the same thing every time they are fed in the wild they would have access to many types of bugs and invertebrates keep your salamander healthy by feeding them a varied diet filled with many different kinds of foods 11 x research source remove uneaten food never leave food that the salamander didn t eat for later it won t have a midnight snack instead remove all live bugs from the vivarium bugs left in the tank can bite or cause irritation to your salamander 12 x research source if your salamander has an aquatic vivarium you should remove all the leftover food from the water this can lead to bacteria and contamination of the water keep salamanders hydrated salamanders don t drink water the way other pets do they are amphibians which means they soak water into their bodies through the skin they get this water from pools in their vivarium 13 x research source keep the substrate on the bottom of the tank hydrated it should have pools of water along the bottom but not be completely drenched use a spray bottle to rehydrate the substrate make sure to use water that does not have chlorine in it use bottled water or tap water that has been left to air out overnight you can also buy water conditioner at pet stores feed a reluctant salamander by hand if your salamander isn t eating you should try feeding it yourself you can put the live bug on a toothpick or pick it up with tweezers hold the bug steady above the salamander and wait for the salamander to eat it 14 x research source salamanders may not eat when you first get them they may also be resistant to new foods try hand feeding them before changing foods or consulting a vet feed it daily for a while if you bought it at a pet shop salamanders that are purchased from a pet shop are usually underfed and skinny this means that you should feed them daily until your salamander adjusts to living in their new environment and puts on some healthy weight 15 x research source adjust the salamander s feeding schedule if needed there may be reasons why your salamander needs to be fed more or less for example they usually need more food in the summer and less in the winter that means that the two to three times a week guideline may need to be adjusted 16 x research source juvenile salamanders need to be fed more often if your salamander is too skinny you may want to feed it more often,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for an aquatic newt,aquatic newts are remarkably amusing pets and very easy to maintain they are relatively active and very personable to stay healthy they need to be taken care of properly the best way to take care of your aquatic newt is to set up the proper aquarium and keep it clean,buy an aquarium aquatic newts need a proper aquarium set up to live happily a 10 gallon 38 l tank is a good choice but a larger tank is generally better don t place your newt in anything smaller 1 x research source newts do well when there are at least two in a tank consider getting two newts which can live happily in a 10 gallon 38 l tank create the right ratio of water to land though the newt is named an aquatic newt they need both land and water in their aquarium consider making your aquarium 70 water and 30 land the tank needs enough land area for your aquatic newt to come completely out of the water and onto the land 2 x research source slope aquarium gravel up towards one edge to create an island or place a large rock inside with a slope for your newt to climb up make sure the slope is not too slippery since newts sometimes have trouble climbing the slope should be gradual instead of steep their feet can slip on steep slopes add enough water aquatic newts will spend most of their time in the water placing enough water in the tank helps ensure they stay healthy the water should be at least 10 inches 35 cm deep the newt should be able to move around while completely submerged under the water 3 x research source you should only use dechlorinated water chlorinated water or water with other chemicals can harm or kill your newt to dechlorinate your water use special reptile dechlorinating tablets which you can purchase online or at pet stores you can also use spring water you can buy spring water at any grocery store or supermarket never use water directly from the tap the chemicals in it will kill your newt if you re going to use water from the tap you must let the water sit out in an open container for at least 48 hours or longer so that the chemicals can evaporate out of the tap water before adding it to your newt s tank line the tank with gravel washed aquarium gravel should be placed along the bottom of the tank place a layer of gravel that is two inches 5 cm thick you can gradually stack the gravel so it slopes out of the water to give your newt a place to get out of the water 4 x research source consider using large smooth round stones for gravel your newt won t be able to eat it and it won t be so sharp that it ll cut your newt s feet small aquarium gravel can be too small for a newt choose gravel or stones that are larger than your newt s feet use a filter the water inside your newt s tank will get dirty so you need to use a filter the filter will depend on how much water is in the tank try to get the smallest filter you can to limit the strength of the flow 5 x research source smaller filters will need to be changed more often cover the tank with the appropriate lid you will need a lid for your aquarium newts are escape artists and will crawl out of any crack they can find use a screen lid to make sure there is enough ventilation for your newt make sure the mesh of the screen lid is small enough that your newt can t slide through 6 x research source provide a uvb light source newts need full spectrum lighting with uvb rays it should be turned on for 10 to 12 hours each day you can place it on a timer so your newt always gets the proper amount of light 7 x research source change part of the water in the aquarium each week even if you have a filter you need to switch out some of the water each week change 20 of the water in the tank siphon the water from the bottom of the tank to help remove debris replace the same amount of water that you took out with dechlorinated water 8 x research source if you don t have a filter you need to switch the water every day or two handle your newt properly newts are not pets that you take out and hold but you may find that you need to hold it for some reason if you use your hands make sure to wash them well with soap first and rinse them extremely well making sure all soap is off your hands wash your hands immediately with soap and warm water after handling your newt 9 x research source never eat food from your hands or touch your face after handling any newt without washing your hands never grab a newt by the tail lift it underneath its belly with a cupped hand instead it s not a good idea to handle your newt while standing unless your hands are over its tank sometimes newts will jump or wiggle unexpectedly and a fall to the ground can be disastrous feed your newt the proper food newts can be fed live or frozen foods they don t need to be fed every day but can be fed every other day you can feed your aquatic newt the following foods 10 x research source frozen or fresh brine shrimp worms like earthworms white worms black worms bloodworms phoenix worms mealworms leaf worms red wigglers or nightcrawlers daphnias flightless fruit flies and crickets if you are feeding your newt live insects you can keep them in a container worms generally come in containers with dirt that they can live in for around seven to ten days for other insects you can keep them in a jar with small holes punched in the lid for ventilation clean the tank regularly a clean tank helps your newt stay healthy and live longer you should do a full tank cleaning every one to two weeks place your newt in a container filled with dechlorinated water while you clean the tank scrub with water or if something is really dirty soap and water make sure to rinse the soap away completely before placing your newt back inside 11 x research source take out everything in the cage including the gravel and all decorations clean the walls of the tank and all the decorations place new or clean gravel into the tank and then refill with clean water and replace everything you ve taken out,Pets-and-Animals
how to find salamanders,salamanders are a type of amphibian that strongly resemble lizards but these creatures are quite different from lizards these amphibians breathe through mucous glands that are located on their mouths throats and skin 1 x research source since a salamander s skin is required to be moist and slick to allow them to breathe salamanders can be found living in humid and wet habitats searching for salamanders in the wild can be a fun educational and exciting adventure to make the most of your experience be sure to visit the salamander s habitat during the right time of year and be sure to take care of the environment around you,visit the salamander s home travel to a geographical region where salamanders generally reside one third of all salamander species can be found in north america specifically in the appalachian mountains region salamanders also reside throughout central america south america asia and europe 2 x research source know what to look for there are over 700 different species of salamanders in the world and they all come in a variety of sizes and colors salamanders have long smooth bodies and four limbs and they can be a small as 2 inches long while others can grow to 4 feet long 3 x research source some species of salamanders are brightly colored which can indicate that they are poisonous 4 x research source the hellbender is a type of large salamander found in north america which can grow up to 2 5 feet in length 5 x research source northern red salamanders are typically found in maryland and live in natural springs they are a bright beautiful red with black flecks 6 x research source some salamanders such as the axolotl or the mexican salamander are pale pink or white these types of salamanders live underground and are rarely exposed to sunlight 7 x research source wait for spring most salamanders live underground but will move out of dormancy in the spring to breed in vernal pools which are shallow depressions in the ground that contain water during this time of year this is the best time of year to search for these critters in the wild visit damp locations locations near wetlands streams rivers ponds marshes and swamps are ideal locations for salamanders to make their home 8 x research source most salamanders have a long larval stage and spend most of their early life in the water much like frogs do 9 x research source these moist environments are ideal for catching a glimpse of these animals in the wild look in edge environments edge environments or eco tones describe areas where two different habitats meet 10 x research source salamanders can often be found in these environments so be sure to look near the shorelines of streams or near shrubs and bushes near shallow water 11 x research source salamanders may also be found around seeps which are areas where ground water slowly moves toward the surface 12 x research source keep an eye out for springs seeps and other boggy areas where these amphibians often make their home 13 x research source look for their food sources salamanders are carnivorous and eat a variety of insects and worms in the wild a salamander will eat crickets worms larvae spiders slugs pretty much anything that it can easily swallow if you know where to find their favorite meals you may have a greater chance of spotting a salamander scurrying about 14 x research source many of the insects in the salamander s diet can be found under logs rocks and branches so you may spot a salamander lurking around these areas larger salamanders will often eat frogs and smaller salamanders while aquatic salamanders will eat small fish crayfish and other small aquatic creatures 15 x research source if you come across a pool of still moving water with lots of rocks and tree roots take a closer look crayfish are often found there so your chances of spotting a salamander are greater search at night or on rainy days make plans to search for salamanders at night or when the weather is overcast and rainy salamanders are nocturnal and can usually be found at night however they may also venture out during daytime hours when it is cloudy or raining look under logs rocks and piles of leaves search for debris on the ground near wetlands and pools of water rocks fallen logs branches and piles of leaves make ideal hiding places salamanders must keep their skin moist in order to breathe and hide under these types of objects to shelter themselves from direct sunlight slowly lift debris slowly flip over pieces of ground debris to find salamanders slow gentle movements may prevent salamanders from becoming alarmed and scurrying away quickly to find another hiding place being careful while lifting the debris will help protect other living organisms that may have made their home there return the debris always return ground debris to its original position any major disruption to rocks logs and other debris could alter the humidity levels the safety of a salamander s habitat and the safety of other living creatures in the area 16 x research source don t spend too much time in one area looking for salamanders in the wild can be a lot of fun but be sure you don t stay in one place too long disturbing leaves and logs and trampling through the grasses in a concentrated area can cause habitat degeneration and may upset the salamander breeding populations 17 x research source stay away from breeding pools if you stumble upon a salamander breeding pool avoid disturbing it watch from a distance so that you do not harm the salamanders or their eggs don t handle the salamanders if it isn t necessary to handle a salamander opt not to the oils on human skin can be toxic to salamanders and the salt and heat from human hands can be harmful to them 18 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for fire belly newts,fire belly newts are one of the best amphibian pets for any beginner they re neat looking cute readily available and affordable they truly are a great pet for any beginner to the aquarium world however newts also present a challenge to pet owners they live a long time they can live from 5 to 10 years on average and up to 30 years if you care for them properly as an animal with such a long lifespan can truly be a life long companion you should do everything in your power to make sure your newt friend has a safe and healthy environment to live in,purchase an aquarium your aquarium will house the environment that your newt will live in there are several things you should consider when getting an aquarium including the size and the number of newts you will house don t use anything smaller than a 10 gallon aquarium it is highly recommended that you house 2 newts together you can safely house 4 newts together in a 20 gallon aquarium the larger your aquarium the happier your newts will be create a proper water land split in your tank fire bellied newts are semi aquatic and require both land and water in their habitat make sure that you create a proper environment that includes both in order for your newt s to thrive the area in your tank should consist of 70 water and 30 land one option is to divide up your tank and build your habitat by creating a partition so that 70 of the surface is water and 30 is land if you have a partition make sure you have a ramp so your newts can climb onto the land another option is to slope your land gravel or other matter into the water so that the newts can climb onto the land via the slope another option is to have 100 water but make sure that 30 of the surface is covered by floating islands and other structures that your newts can rest on 1 x research source line the bottom of your aquarium with large gravel gravel is a great material to line the bottom of your aquarium round gravel will help simulate round rocks found in rivers and creeks in the newt s native environment but there are also other reasons to use gravel it will keep your sediment down and help promote clarity in your water large gravel will be too big for your newt to accidentally eat when wet gravel is slick and your newt won t be able to cut or injure itself on it prepare a burrowing substrate if you want burrowing substrate is ground material that will enable your newt to burrow within the land just as they would do in the wild allowing your newt to live like it would in the wild is extremely important in maintaining your newt s health and happiness consider putting your substrate atop large gravel if you are dividing your tank or if you are creating a slope for the newt to crawl from the water to the land portion common materials might include peat moss sphagnum moss coco husk orchid bark chips and more consult your local pet stores for ideas or for a pre mixed bag of substrate do not use regular soil make sure any material you do use does not include any chemical additives or fertilizers 2 x research source ensure that you have enough water since newts are semi aquatic the water portion of your aquarium will be where they spend a lot of their time you need to make sure that you have enough water for your newts to make sure they stay healthy and fit your water should be at least 10 inches deep 35 centimeters water should be at least 70 of the surface area of your tank your newt should have plenty of room to move around under the water 3 x research source fill your aquarium with plants your newts need a nice environment that simulates the environment they d have in the wild to do this you need to populate your aquarium with plants consider terrestrial plants like ferns mosses and bamboo aquatic plants like egeria and amazon sword other plants native to the newt s native environment you can also use fake plants as a substitute for real plants 4 x research source recruit your newts there are two types of common fire bellied newts the japanese newt and the chinese newt the newts are very similar but differ somewhat pick one species of newt try not to mix and match the japanese newt is somewhat larger 3 5 inches to 5 inches in length at maturity whereas the chinese newt is a little smaller 3 inches to 4 inches at maturity the japanese newt has a speckled red orange pattern on its belly whereas the chinese newt s belly is more of an orange color the japanese newt has a rough or bumpy texture to its skin whereas the chinese newt has a smooth texture to its skin the chinese newt s tail is round at the end 5 x research source learn about your newt fire belly newts are really cool animals but you should get to know a little bit about them before you make a big commitment the good thing about them is that they re relatively easy to take care of as long as you maintain their environment regularly and follow simple directions make sure to consider that newts can live up to 30 years the typical newt will live up to 10 years be prepared for a commitment you shouldn t flush your newt or release him in your backyard when you re done with him he ll probably die the most common fire belly newts are the japanese or chinese varieties the chinese newt is much more commonly found in pet stores 6 x research source handle your newt with caution there are a number of reasons you need to handle your newt with caution improperly handling your newt could harm the newt or potentially cause you problems yourself consider newts are relatively fragile if you handle them improperly you could hurt them newts have poison glands on the side of their head if you get some of this poison on your hands it is likely to irritate your skin make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before and after handling your newt you don t want to contaminate the newt with chemicals or yourself with the poison from its poison glands 7 x research source monitor your water quality clean water is essential for your newts health and a prolonged life as a result changing your water and monitoring your water is perhaps the most time consuming aspect of owning your newt experts highly recommend that newt owners invest in a water filter to make sure the water quality stays consistently high only use dechlorinated or spring water avoid chlorinated water or water with other chemicals at all costs if you don t have a filter you ll have to change your water every day if you do have a filter you ll have to change and or add a third of water every week if you can t tend to the water as prescribed you should consider a different pet 8 x research source clean your habitat aside from water cleaning and filtration you need to clean your aquarium regularly to make sure your newt s habitat is healthy and functioning a clean and well maintained habitat is key to your newt s health and longevity clean every two weeks or so take out your newts and temporarily house them elsewhere while you are cleaning remove all water plants rocks any anything other than the gravel and substrate sterilize fake rocks fake plants and other plastic aquarium monuments with reptile friendly sterilizing solution consult your local pet store for this solution make sure to read the directions carefully refill with clean water and replace everything you ve taken out maintain a proper temperature in your newt s aquarium newts need to have a specific set of environmental factors to thrive the most important being temperature next to having a moist environment you need to maintain a relatively stable temperature range for your newt to thrive as it would in the wild consider the temperature in your aquarium should be no higher than 68 f 20 c avoid temps cooler than the low 50s monitor this often higher temperatures will stress your newt and cause discomfort or death keep your aquarium out of direct sunlight and consider storing it in the basement where it s usually cooler 9 x research source feed your newt properly you ll have to feed your newt a proper diet you can give your newt either live or frozen food newts don t have to eat every day either you can feed them every other day there are a number of readily available food sources earthworms bloodworms crickets chop your newt s food up to make it easier on them 10 x research source avoid housing your newts with other animals you might be tempted to cohabitate your newts with other animals however before you do this you need to check with your local pet store because your newts secrete a poison they might harm other animals or poison the water for fish at the same time larger reptiles or fish might kill or injure your newt 11 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to house a pet axolotl,axolotls or mexican walking fish are aquatic salamanders that keep their external gills even as adults 1 x research source if you want an interesting aquarium pet keeping an axolotl is a relatively easy process as long as they re legal to own in your area as long as you maintain a cold aquarium with hiding spots you can have a unique pet of your own,get a 20 us gal 76 l aquarium tank find a tank that s about 30 inches 76 cm long 12 inches 30 cm wide and 12 inches 30 cm tall so your axolotl has room to swim around 2 x research source don t keep axolotls in a tank with other fish or species axolotls may try to eat smaller fish and larger animals could get aggressive with your axolotls put the tank away from windows and out of direct sunlight axolotls are sensitive to light and should be kept away from windows and sun keep your aquarium in a lower level of your house where the lighting remains constant throughout the day 3 x research source sunlight can also heat your tank and stress out your axolotls line the bottom of the tank with 3 in 7 6 cm of fine sand or large rocks axolotls will try to eat anything that fits in their mouth so pebbles will get stuck in their digestive system look for fine aquarium sand or rocks larger than the axolotl s head to line the bottom of your tank 4 x research source sand or rock substrates can be purchased from your local pet or aquarium store fine aquarium sand is small enough to pass through the axolotl s digestive system without causing any harm don t leave the bottom of your tank bare since axolotls cannot grip glass easily and may become stressed attach a filter with minimal water flow to the side of the tank axolotls prefer slow moving water and get stressed in high currents visit your local pet store to find an aquarium filter with the slowest current such as a sponge filter install the filter on the side of your tank following the manufacturer s instructions 5 x research source if you can t a filter with a slow current put aquatic plants in front of it to lessen the flow 6 x research source fill the tank with dechlorinated water 2 3 weeks before getting an axolotl tap water can contain chlorine which could harm your axolotl over time if you plan on using tap water either add a dechlorinating agent to treat it immediately or allow the chlorine to naturally evaporate over the course of a day keep the water in your tank for a few weeks before housing an axolotl so it has time to cycle 7 x research source dechlorinating agents can be purchased from your local pet store or online cover the tank with a mesh lid axolotls can jump out of an open top aquarium which could be fatal to them make sure your aquarium comes with a mesh lid since it helps control the water temperature and protects your pets 8 x research source if your tank didn t come with a mesh lid check your local pet store or online for one place 1 2 hollow rocks or pipes so your axolotl has a hiding place axolotls are nocturnal and sensitive to bright lights so they need places to hide during the day look for hollow rocks or ceramic shelters at your local pet store to put in your aquarium otherwise use pvc pipes with a 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm circumference for simple hiding holes 9 x research source provide multiple hiding places if you re housing more than 1 axolotl each axolotl should have its own place to hide keep 3 4 sturdy cold water plants in your aquarium axolotls may bump into plants and uproot them if they don t have a sturdy base look for freshwater plants at your local pet or aquarium store keep the plants you buy in small pots when you place them in your axolotl tank so they don t get knocked over 10 x research source plants like java ferns can be anchored to decorations such as large rocks or driftwood if you don t want to care for or prune aquatic plants use artificial plants instead put your plants in front of your filter if it has a strong current put in other smooth rocks or driftwood for extra decoration axolotls have poor eyesight so they tend to bump into their surroundings avoid decorations or rocks that have sharp or jagged edges since they could damage your axolotl s skin instead use 2 3 smooth structures such as driftwood or solid rocks to beautify your tank more 12 x research source adding decoration to your tank is optional keep your aquarium below 70 f 21 c axolotls natively live in cold water and get stressed out in hot water avoid keeping your tank in direct sunlight or on upper floors of your home keep the aquarium in a room away from windows and monitor the temperature daily 13 x research source keep a thermometer in your axolotl tank so you can check the temperature at a glance axolotls can handle temperatures as low as 40 f 4 c clean any waste along the substrate with a siphon each week axolotl waste looks like dirt and has a high level of ammonia that affects the balance of your water to clean it put the end of your siphon hose in a bucket put the other end of your siphon into the aquarium face down hold the siphon against your substrate so it creates a vacuum that lifts the waste 14 x research source water siphons can be purchased from your local pet store change 25 of the water in your tank every week fill a bucket full of tap water the night before you perform the water change so the chlorine can evaporate siphon 25 of the water in your tank into another bucket to remove it pour the bucket of water you prepared the night before slowly into the tank so it doesn t shock your axolotls 15 x research source if you need to perform a water change on the same day use a dechlorinating agent in your tap water monitor the ph of your water once a week axolotls can survive anywhere between a ph level of 6 5 8 0 use a ph water meter to check the levels of your tank to see if they re in a healthy range if your ph is too low raise the ph by performing a water change or adding 1 tsp 4 8 g of

how to make a tank for fire belly newts,fire bellied newts are small amphibians that make great pets and are a wise choice for first time amphibian owners before you get a newt to keep as a pet educate yourself on their lifestyle and habits and prepare an appropriate habitat to ensure that your newt will live a long and happy life,learn about newts the type of tank that any reptile or amphibian pet needs depends on several factors that vary by species including the size of an adult an adult fire bellied newt is approximately 4 6 inches long sometimes pet stores carry juveniles as small as two inches long 1 x research source its habitat in the wild fire bellied newts originate in japan where they are semi aquatic and spend most of their time in clear cool bodies of water like lakes ponds and streams 2 x research source this means that pet newts need a home that has water to swim in but also some areas of land a good rule of thumb is to divide its home with 70 being water and 30 dry land 3 x research source its habits newts are amphibians so they go through metamorphosis from a tadpole to larva to fully developed adult they spend the first part of their life in water and as adults spend time on land and in the water older fire belly newts are more aquatic and are generally easier to keep as pets 4 x research source they can live up to thirty years with excellent care most live to be about fifteen 5 x research source its diet newts in the wild are carnivorous and like a diet of insects but you can also feed them dried reptile or amphibian food such as reptomin floating food sticks 6 x research source while it s fine to feed them primarily dried food they need a varied diet including live food such as bloodworms blackworms guppies and crickets this keeps them active and alert since they have to hunt and also helps to ensure they get the proper nutrition before you purchase newts be sure that you have a local store or source to regularly purchase these insects you must also be sure you ll be comfortable keeping such food available for the newts and feeding live food to them 7 x research source decide how many newts you want salamanders are not social nor are they solitary that means they really don t care either way if they live alone or with others however you must only put fire bellied newts with other newts of the same species and no other types of animals or creatures 8 x research source fire bellied newts secrete a toxin from their skin that can be harmful to other species and other types of animals so it is important to keep only newts of one species in your aquarium 9 x research source be aware that japanese and chinese fire bellied newts are actually two separate species and they should not be kept together they are hard to tell apart unless you have seen both types but chinese newts are a bit smaller smoother and have slightly rounder tail tips than japanese newts 10 x research source if in doubt buy your newts from the same tank at the same store so that you know they are the same species plan where you will keep the tank you will need a 10 or 20 gallon tank depending on how many newts you plan to have one 10 gallon tank can house from one to four newts for five to ten newts go with the 20 gallon tank the tank will be heavy and needs to be placed on top of a secure piece of furniture that can hold its weight without risk of tipping or breaking it also needs to be away from windows and air vents so that heat and cold does not affect your newt purchase a 10 or 20 gallon aquarium or terrarium you can purchase these online or in your local pet store or big box store or shop local garage sales or classified ads to find a used one at a discount glass or plexiglas is a good choice so that you can observe your animal be sure that the aquarium has a tight fitting lid since newts are notorious for trying to escape their habitats and can climb the glass walls of an aquarium 11 x research source decide if you want to use rocks at the bottom of the tank it is easier to clean a tank with a smooth bottom and newts do not need rocks or other substrate in their habitat but rocks provide an attractive addition to the tank if you use rocks at the bottom of the tank purchase smooth rounded stones or gravel and ensure it is large enough that it cannot be ingested rough stones will injure the newts skin 12 x research source test your water quality newts have thin skin and chemicals in the water will affect their health and can even kill them before filling the tank check the ph and ammonia of your water with a home test kit available for purchase online or at your local home or pet store and use a liquid dechlorinator to prepare the water a ph of 7 0 is ideal for newts but they will do well in water between 6 5 and 7 5 ph 13 x research source test your water for ammonia as well test kits are available in the aquarium section of most large pet stores ammonia is lethal to newts 14 x research source dechlorinating chemicals are available at pet stores in liquid and tablet form simply add the recommended amount to the water and let it sit for a few minutes you can also use bottled spring water if you prefer to skip these steps 15 x research source decide what to use for the land portion of the aquarium there are many options and newts can thrive in many different set ups so it depends mostly on what is available and what you think looks best aesthetically remember the goal is to give the newts dry land in about 30 of their aquarium which can be made from a rocky slope you can simply arrange smooth pebbles and rocks peat live moss or sandy soil to come out of the water at a slope so that the newts can climb up to eat floating corkbark turtle platforms or live or plastic plants the land does not have to actually be land as long as it is floating out of the water and the newts can climb onto it 16 x research source provide your newt a place to hide newts like to have a place in the water where they can hide and have privacy you can use something from around your home or purchase something specific for this purpose pet stores sell all types of hiding places for aquariums such as tunnels treasure chests etc but you can also use a simple small terracotta pot placed on its side in the bottom of the aquarium even a mug you no longer use will work in a pinch you could also use logs branches and stones which can be purchased at a pet store or found in nature if you use found objects be sure to sterilize them before putting them in your pet s habitat to ensure there are no insects or parasites present 17 x research source change the newts water daily newts need about 10 inches of water but since they use the water as their toilet bacteria will grow quickly unless you change the water frequently you can change it less often if you only have one or two newts use a turkey baster or small measuring cup to remove most of the water and then add in treated room temperature water to bring the water level back up to 10 inches feed your newts regularly newts only need to be fed 2 3 times a week and most newts will eat 3 4 small insects such as bloodworms crickets earthworms or maggots at each feeding 18 x research source remove any uneaten bugs or insects after a few hours clean the habitat regularly every week or two you should remove the newts using a fish net or your hands if you can catch them to a small holding container with a lid while thoroughly sanitizing the entire habitat the water should be completely refreshed and the inside of the aquarium sanitized including any additions to the habitat like rocks or plastic plants any live plants should be removed while cleaning the enclosure to be replaced when everything is sanitized 19 x research source be sure that you let the water in the tank come to room temperature before you put the newts back in since they are sensitive to hot and cold temperatures be safe with lighting newts do not require additional heating or lighting and can become overheated if they are too close to a light source however you can use an aquarium light to help you see the newt in its habitat ensure that you switch off any lights at night be careful with handling your newt although most people enjoy handling their salamanders occasionally newts are fragile and can be injured easily try to limit your time holding the newts to once a day for a few minutes ensure that your own hands are moist when you handle the newts as this helps to protect its protective mucus covering on its skin 20 x research source newts also secrete a toxin from their skin so it is very important that you do not handle them if you have an open cut or wound on your skin as the toxin can be harmful be sure that you wash your hands very thoroughly after handling the newt and do not rub your eyes or face when you are holding them as the toxins can cause temporary blindness 21 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to take care of tiger salamanders,tiger salamanders are a pleasure to keep as pets they are beautiful to observe and they don t bark late at night they are larger hardier and generally more interactive than other salamanders which can make them better pets they are relatively straightforward to care for but you must make sure you feed them the proper foods and provide them with an appropriate habitat,get a suitable enclosure the best type of enclosure for adult tiger salamanders is a vivarium or aquarium tank these glass enclosures allow you to observe your salamander closely as well as being very sturdy and reliable the tank will need a secure wire mesh for the lid to allow a free circulation of air 1 x research source one adult tiger salamander will need a 10 gallon tank the dimensions of this will be approximately 50x25cm or 20x30 inches two salamanders require a 20 gallon tank 73x30cm 29x12 inches do not house two males together or they might fight tigers are often best kept individually 2 x research source the surface area of the tank that is the length x width is more important than the height a cheaper alternative to an aquarium tank is a plastic storage tub with a tightly fitted lid if you opt for this you will have to drill plenty of small holes to enable the circulation of air 3 x research source provide good substrate you should get a good substrate that will prevent desiccation and enable your salamander to do some burrowing it should be at least 4 inches or 10cm deep you should get a substrate that retains some moisture but doesn t become muddy or dry out it should also be able to break down some organic matter such as uneaten food and faeces good substrates include organic top soil which is free from chemicals fertilizers and pesticides coco fiber is another good choice a mix of the two is recommended you should avoid peat moss or soil mixtures that contain peat moss these are often acidic and can lead to your salamander becoming ill similarly you should always avoid using gravel or pine or cedar chips 4 x research source create hiding spaces tiger salamanders will like to have places to hide in their habitat you should provide two hides on each side of the tank they should be dark and secure and can be easily fashioned using pieces of cork bark you can also buy commercially produced coconut halves which make excellent hides alternatively you can just turn an empty plant pot on its side you can introduce plants and stones to create a more varied and stimulating environment your tiger will want around and explore his surroundings if you introduce anything from outside such as stones or branches you need to sanitise them first soak them in chlorine water solution rinse thoroughly soak in clean water and then allow them to dry naturally 5 x research source fake plants available from pet stores are a more straightforward option monitor the temperature and lighting compared to some other amphibians it is relatively straightforward to provide the appropriate temperature and lighting for good health tigers will do well kept at a temperature of around 77 fahrenheit or 22 celsius or a little lower in captivity they generally tolerate lower temperatures better than they do higher ones sustained exposure to temperatures over 78 f 25 5 c can be stressful and harmful 6 x research source tiger salamanders don t need additional uv lighting like some other amphibians 7 x research source as long as the salamander has exposure to ambient light during the day and is in a dark environment during the night you should not need to make any further provisions 8 x research source feed him appropriately salamanders are carnivores they are attracted to prey by its movement they will hunt for food and it can be interesting to watch them feed and they will most often just ignore already dead prey and food pellets 9 x research source because of this you will need to feed your tiger with a varied diet of insects every day good food choices include meal worms crickets earthworms flour beetles caterpillars and moths try feeding your salamander 3 or 4 insects in one session each day your salamander may get insufficient calcium and vitamins from the insects you should guard against this by dusting the live food with calcium and vitamin supplements once a week 10 x research source crickets are a particularly poor source of calcium so don t rely on these too much 11 x research source you can feed your salamander an occasional pinkie mouse but keep this irregular as your salamander can easily become obese if he has regular mice 12 x research source provide clean fresh water daily your tiger salamander will need access to water in the air which he will absorb through his skin you should provide a water dish that your salamander can climb into that is large enough for him move around in but still shallow the water should be changed daily and the bowl kept clean if you are using a heat bulb ensure the water bowl is on the opposite side of the enclosure as well as a water bowl you will need to mist the enclosure by spraying water into it this will help maintain the environment and provide more water for your tiger there is no fixed amount amount that you should mist your enclosure but monitor the substrate and mist when it looks to be losing moisture 13 x research source misting a few times a week will often be enough you can provide a variety of different levels of moisture in different parts of the enclosure and allow the salamander to seek out the environment it wants at that moment 14 x research source keep the enclosure clean you should spot clean the enclosure every day to remove any uneaten food shed skin and faeces you can do this when you change the water and check the moisture level of the substrate clean out and sterilise the tank completely every few weeks use a reptile amphibian friendly disinfectant which you can buy from your local pet store be sure to sterilise all the items in the tanks including plants logs and stones 15 x research source avoid it as much as possible tiger salamanders have very sensitive skin so you should generally avoid handling them these are not creatures which you can play with in the same way you would with a different kind of pet the fun comes from observing them rather than handling them there may however be occasions when you need to handle a tiger salamander so it s important to know how to do this safely ensure your hands are clean if you are going to handle your tiger salamander it s crucial that you make sure your hands are clean first salamander skin is very sensitive to oils salts and any other residues on your hands because salamanders absorb liquid through their skin exposure to the elements on your hands can cause health problems and can cause the tiger to become dehydrated wet your hands with bottled water after washing your hands be sure to thoroughly rinse them with purified water such as bottled mineral water before you handle the salamander after washing and rinsing wet your hands again with purified water before you handle the salamander wetting your hands like this will limit the chances of your tiger becoming dehydrated 16 x research source even after taking these precautions you should only handle your salamander for short periods if you are moving your salamander to a separate container while you clean the main tank ensure that you have wet the floor of this container with purified water before you put him in 17 x research

eyes cloudy eyes can be a sign of a sick newt a healthy newt should have clear eyes that are black brown in color clouding and discoloration in the eyes are signs of a sick newt do not purchase a newt with clouded eyes and return any that are shipped with signs of illness find a larger newt you want a newt that is well fed from the beginning avoid small lethargic newts as they may be at greater risk of disease and early death the average chinese fire bellied newt is 2 4 inches long as an adult and should look thick with its belly almost touching the floor 2 x research source the average japanese fire bellied newt can reach 4 6 inches as an adult though young newts may be as small as 2 inches japanese newts are more slender but should still be as thick by their hind legs as they are near their head 3 x research source look for behavioral signs of illness you may notice signs of illness at the pet store or during the first few days of having a newt talk to the pet store about

balance are all signs of illness in newts find a tank your newt is going to need a habitat as soon as it arrives use a glass or acrylic tank as a terrarium ten gallons is the minimum size you need for one newt for more newts you will need more space 1 2 newts 10 gallon 37 9 l 3 5 newts 20 gallon 75 7 l get a good substrate newts prefer a mostly aquatic habitat with a small land area try smooth slate or gravel for the water area and a land area with a moss or mulch type soil 5 x research source plant the land area with decorative plants that have large broad leaves as well as stacked rocks for basking fire bellied newts often appreciate underwater vegetation as well set up climate control newts need a consistent climate of 58 68 f or 14 20 c letting a newt get too hot or too cold could be damaging to its health use heat lamps in cold climates to keep your newts warm if your newt habitat is getting too warm air conditioning is often the best option if that is not available some newt owners have successfully cooled their pets using fans above the tank or ice packs against the outer walls of the habitat provide good lighting newts need 10 12 hours of full spectrum uva lighting a day purchase lamps and proper bulbs that fit over the edge of your terrarium you may be able to provide proper lighting and heating with the same bulb check packaging to see if your heat bulbs also offer uv feed your newt purchase food at the same time as purchasing your newt live and packaged foods both provide good nutrition for your newt if used properly 6 x research source frozen mosquito

how to raise tadpoles,by raising and releasing tadpoles you not only get to witness a remarkable transformation but you also bring more frogs into the world frogs that will eat pesky bugs like gnats flies mosquitoes and more to keep them healthy and ensure that their metamorphosis goes smoothly you ll need to have the right set up and know how,find a suitable container to house the tadpoles tadpoles can be raised in most containers though it s best for them to be housed outside so that you attract more mosquitos to lay their larva for the tadpoles to eat nature provides a cleaner and more oxygenated atmosphere and because it s more natural be sure to keep them in the shade at all times though suitable containers include a large aquatic tank a large oven roast bowl a small pool if outside a tub lay a suitable base on the bottom of the housing use gravel to cover well add a big rock or two for shelter and land when the tadpoles transform 1 x research source put small weeds and grass with the roots attached to the water so the tadpoles can hang onto them and they eat the roots 2 x research source make sure there has not been a recent application of pesticides on any plant life added as this will kill the tadpoles within a day provide shade for about three quarters of the area if the tadpoles are outdoors the tadpoles must be able to get out of direct sunlight when they want to keep about 5 10 tadpoles per litre of water you can keep more but they may die out faster or become carnivorous keep the water clean tadpoles need clean dechlorinated water 3 x research source rainwater is one of the best waters to keep your tadpoles in since it contains mosquito larva and doesn t contain any chemicals some advise using water from where you found the tadpoles citation needed do not use tap water it s too full of chemicals that can harm tadpoles if you want to use tap water use water conditioner sold at pet stores for fish change the water regularly try to only change half the water at a time to keep the ph of the water balanced a turkey baster is good for this and disturbs the tadpoles as little as possible whilst making it easy to remove debris that gathers at the bottom of the container but this is optional not many tadpole frog owners have these boil romaine lettuce for 10 to 15 minutes it s ready when the leaves are soft and squishy drain and cut it into little pieces feed a pinch every day 4 x research source other types of lettuce should work too however only use softer leaves also all pieces should be small enough for their tiny mouths tadpoles can also be fed normal flake fish food but only in small pinches as it s not the absolute best for them a couple of pinches a week should keep the tadpoles hunger satisfied depending on the number of tadpoles you keep too much food can cause death to the tadpoles from over eating be patient they usually develop from egg to tadpole in 6 to 12 weeks 5 x research source keep that in mind and don t panic when it gets cold in winter the tadpoles will grow more slowly the ideal temperature is between 65 75 degrees fahrenheit or around 20 25 degrees celsius prepare for their metamorphosis when your tadpoles develop legs you will need a container with dirt for them to crawl up onto or they will drown do not feed the tadpoles when they have sprouted arms at this time the tadpole will be using its tail as food and it will become an adult frog 6 x research source provide more food after metamorphosis if you aren t releasing the froglets they will likely need larger housing be aware that many froglets dislike being handled the tank or housing for them must be kept clean daily otherwise bacteria will spread rapidly and can kill them,Pets-and-Animals
how to keep a wild caught toad as a pet,if you see a lot of toads in your yard or around your home you might be thinking about trying to catch one and keep it as a pet although wild toads don t make great long term pets they are relatively cheap to care for and can be fun to look after for a while by knowing how to catch house and feed for your toad you can find a pet that ll love being cared for,keep your toad in a 15 us gal 57 l aquarium tank a toad needs a good amount of space to hop around when it s kept as a pet purchase a 15 us gal 57 l tank from a pet store or online to keep your toad in the tank should be at least 24 inches 61 cm long 12 inches 30 cm tall and 12 inches 30 cm wide to keep your toad happy 1 x research source make sure you choose a tank with a mesh or screen lid that fastens tightly to prevent your toad from escaping the lid will stop your toad from jumping out of the tank and it should be mesh or screen to provide proper ventilation toads are comfortable at room temperature and in ambient daylight so you don t need to purchase any heaters or lamps for your toad keep the tank out of direct sunlight because too much sun can hurt your toad if you want to catch more than 1 toad to keep as a pet you ll need a bigger tank for every extra toad you want to keep in the tank you ll need a tank that is 5 us gal 19 l bigger however keeping more than 4 or 5 toads may require a very large tank or result in some of your toads breeding unexpectedly add a substrate material such as eco earth or moss to the tank a substrate is any dirt like material you can place at the bottom of your toad s tank that will absorb its waste and give it something to burrow into purchase some eco earth moss or shredded leaves and pour 3 to 4 inches 7 6 to 10 2 cm into the base of your tank 2 x research source you can also buy specialty substrate material at a pet store which will make sure your toad is extra comfortable don t use anything too hard like gravel or sand as substrate it could be harmful to your toad if it swallows it to make it easier for your toad to dig into the substrate moisten it with a spray bottle of non chlorinated water every few days give your toad a dish of non chlorinated water to sit in while toads don t drink as much water as a lot of other common pets they do need to spend a lot of the day soaking in water to stay hydrated keep a large dish or pool of non chlorinated water in the tank that your toad can sit in make sure it s not taller than the height of your toad or else it may drown 3 x research source use dechlorination tablets to remove the chlorine from tap water or fill the dish with bottled water don t use distilled water as it will be missing a lot of nutrients that the toads need to survive even the small amounts of chlorine found in most tap water will be harmful to your toad so it s important to use water that is filtered bottled or has been treated for chlorine if you notice the water becoming cloudy you should change it this might be as often as once a day to keep your toad happy the water should be shallow enough for your toad to sit in but not so shallow that it cannot soak properly try and keep the depth of your water around half of the height of your toad add some hiding places to your tank toads love having places to hide and things to burrow under so adding some decorations to the toad s tank will make it much happier add in a piece of wood some large rocks and some plants to make the toad s new home feel as natural as possible 4 x research source make sure that you don t put anything in the tank that could fall over and hurt the toad try and use low and wide objects rather than anything too tall gather some plants rocks or branches from the area where you caught your toad to make it feel at home anything natural gathered from your yard should be safe whereas introducing foreign or strange items may distress your toad avoid handling the toad as much as possible while your toad should be happy to live in its tank it probably won t be used to being picked up and played with watch your toad as it hops around and keeps you company but try to touch it as little as possible 5 x research source as well as making the toad uncomfortable or nervous the oils on your skin can be harmful to the toad with too much contact clean the tank every month with clean water take your toad out of the tank and keep it somewhere safe remove the substrate and anything else in the tank use a cloth dampened with clean water to scrub out the inside of the tank and clean the glass rinsing the cloth whenever it gets dirty dry the walls of the tank with a new cloth and add new substrate and hiding places then put your toad back in the tank 6 x research source keep your toad in a smaller tank or a critter carrier while you clean out the main tank make sure it has plenty of water in the holding tank so that it remains comfortable purchase live insects to feed your toad wild toads are used to having to hunt to catch their food so they won t be interested in food that doesn t move purchase some live worms and crickets from your local pet store and carefully lower them into your toad s tank to feed it you can also feed your toad insects you find in nature 7 x research source only feed your toad insects that will be able to easily fit in its mouth otherwise it might choke while trying to eat toads are carnivorous and get most of their nutrients from eating insects if you re not comfortable with feeding your toad live insects keeping a wild toad as a pet might not be for you feed your toad 1 or 2 insects each day your toad won t need to eat a lot to stay healthy and happy but it does need to be fed regularly to stay alive give your toad 1 or 2 insects every day feeding it more or more often if you notice it losing weight 8 x research source if you re feeding your toad smaller insects such as ants or ladybugs you should feed it twice as much or twice as often to keep it healthy add a calcium supplement powder to the food a few times each week to help keep your toad healthy enhance its nutrition with a calcium or vitamin supplement powder once or twice a week sprinkle a small amount of a supplement powder designed for toads over the toad s food before feeding it 9 x research source supplement powders made specifically to keep toads healthy can be found at your local pet store or by looking online in the wild natural sunlight will help toads process calcium more effectively when kept in a tank or indoors they need a supplement to make up for the absence of sunlight and keep them healthy look for toads in dark damp places toads need a lot of water and very little sunlight to live happily so they tend to spend time in shadowy places with a lot of water look around your yard in dark damp places to see if you can find a toad to catch it might also help to go out toad hunting at dusk especially on a day when it has recently been raining 10 x research source look in around and under bushes or logs when trying to find your new pet toads can be burnt by too much direct sunlight so you might need to look in a few hiding places to find one in the springtime male toads will sit in pools of water and croak loudly to try and find a mate listen out for loud croaking or look in ponds and puddles to try to find a toad if there s nowhere nearby that you think toads could hide try making a small area that ll be more comfortable for one make a small puddle add some hiding places and add some decorations to make an area that will attract toads move slowly to catch a toad with your hands you re a lot bigger than a toad so you ll need to move slowly quietly and carefully to catch a toad in your hands without scaring it away slowly kneel down in front of the toad and cup your hands around the toad lift it up off the ground holding it carefully to stop it from jumping out suddenly 11 x research source if you feel something wet in your hands don t panic the toad is releasing water from its bladder not peeing on you if the toad jumps out of your hands it might hurt itself by hitting the ground too hard try and avoid handling the toad too much as the oils on your skin can hurt it move your toad to a holding container as quickly as possible act quickly to catch a toad with a net while you ll need to move slowly and quietly to get close to a toad you should move in one swift motion to catch it in a net swoop down over the toad with a bug net letting the top of the net fold over so the toad can hop into it once the toad hops further into the net pick it up and twist the top to keep the toad from jumping out 12 x research source you ll need great aim to catch a toad properly if you miss and hit the toad with the edge of the net you may hurt it don t keep the toad in your net for too long as it won t be very comfortable for it keep the toad somewhere with plenty of water while you move it toads need a lot of water to soak in to stay comfortable bring a small tank container or critter carrier with you when you go out toad hunting fill it with 1 2 inch 1 3 cm of non chlorinated water to keep the toad happy as you move it to its new home 13 x research source most tap water has some chlorine in it which can be harmful to toads use tap water that has been treated with a dechlorinating tablet or filtered or bottled water to keep your toad healthy as you move it try to avoid sloshing the water around too much as this might distress the toad transfer the toad to its new enclosure move your critter carrier tank or container inside so that it is very near to your tank take the lid off the tank and quickly scoop the toad out of its temporary container before lowering it softly into its new tank after 1 or 2 days it should adjust to the tank and hop around happily 14 x research source if your tank is large enough you could also lower the transport tank into the new enclosure leave the lid on the transport tank open to let your toad jump out when it feels comfortable make sure you replace the lid as soon as your toad is in the tank if your toad doesn t seem to be adjusting to the tank and seems unhappy you may need to release it back into the wild try and find a different toad that will be more happy in captivity,Pets-and-Animals
how to tell the difference between a frog and a toad,frogs and toads may seem similar but they are quite different there are many physical differences such as differences in skin color and body type there are also differences in behavior a frog will need to be in close proximity to a body of water for instance while a toad can be further away frogs also tend to hop higher than toads with some attention to detail you should be able to tell a toad from a frog,look at the hind legs you can tell the difference between a frog and a toad by the length of its legs if you can get close enough get a good look at the back legs specifically 1 x research source a frog s hind legs are very long as frogs hop more frequently than toads a frog s hind legs will be bigger than its head and body a toad s hind legs will be smaller as toads tend to crawl their hind legs will be shorter than their heads and bodies examine the feet frogs have webbed feet as they spend most of their life in water they will usually have webbed back feet and some will have webbed front feet you may also see sticky pads on a frog s feet toad feet are generally not webbed and do not have pads 2 x research source consider the shape frogs tend to be slender and athletic in appearance toads on the other hand are shorter and stubbier 3 x research source a slender looking amphibian with longer limbs is probably a frog a short chubby amphibian with smaller legs is likely a toad take note of the skin frog skin is a lot smoother than toad skin a toad s skin will be bumpy in appearance while a frog will have smooth rubbery skin a toad may look like it s covered in warts look at the color in general frogs are lighter colored than toads they tend to look greener while toads may have a greenish skin they tend to be darker overall than frogs 4 x research source toads come in various shades that range from a dark green to an olive green frogs are on the more yellowish brighter side of the green spectrum frogs may have a yellow olive color however do not rely on color alone always consider other factors as some frogs do have a brownish green appearance watch how the animal jumps both frogs and toads jump frogs however tend to jump more often and much higher 5 x research source frogs take very high jumps and can also jump great lengths toads take very small hops and lack the ability to jump very far notice if the animal ever crawls toads are much more likely to crawl than hop crawling is a toad s main form of movement you will rarely see a frog crawling an animal that is crawling is very likely to be a toad 6 x research source always consider other factors as an injured frog may crawl consider where you found the animal frogs need to be close to water to survive while toads can spend a lot of time out of water an animal that stays close to water is likely to be a frog if you find an animal far away from water it is probably a toad a frog is unlikely to wander far from a source of water 7 x research source dim your lights to reduce noise from frogs frogs can make a lot of noise at night especially when they re breeding frogs eat insects and bright lights can attract insects near your home this may also cause frogs to gather in your backyard 8 x research source keep things like your porch light off at night you can also use curtains at night to keep light from inside your house from attracting bugs keep dogs away from frogs and toads some frogs and toads may be toxic to dogs if a dog picks up a toad in its mouth toxins could be released that are poisonous to your dog if you see your dog carrying a toad take your dog to a vet immediately this is a medical emergency 9 x research source symptoms of toxins from a toad include excessive drooling pawing at the mouth or eyes seizures difficulty breathing and unsteady moving if your pet has any of these symptoms it needs immediate treatment wash your hands after handling frogs or toads in general refrain from handling wildlife however if you touched a frog or toad wash your hands afterwards 10 x research source if a young child picked up a frog or toad make sure to have them wash their hands do not take in wild

an empty coconut shell to climb into 2 x research source give your toad a swimming pool the pool should be roughly half the toad s height and four times as long as your toad it is very important that the water you use to fill the pool is dechlorinated toads can die if given chlorinated water make sure that there is a ramp of some kind that the toad can walk up when he is done frolicking in the water as toads are relatively poor swimmers an easy way to make a water bath for your toad is to buy a shallow plastic bowl make a hole in the substrate so that the bowl s mouth is level with the rest

to keep your toad happy toads should have roughly 12 hours of sunlight each day use a daylight lamp or a low uv level lamp but only you have provided your toad with hiding places so he can get away from the light if he feels like it 5 x research source if you want to be able to see your toad at night you can install a red lamp to light up his home at night toads are most active at night toads can t see red light so they will think they are moving around in the dark but you will still be able to see them make sure the terrarium has enough moisture while toads do not enjoy the water as much as true frogs do they still need a relatively moist habitat use a mist bottle daily to mist one side of the tank the side with the water bowl so that the toad can choose whether he wants to be on wet or dry terrain only use water that you are positive is chlorine free 6 x research source do not take a toad from the wild wild animals should not be taken from their home in the wilderness no matter how cute you think a toad s goofy face is the fact is many types of toads are endangered because we have been leveling their homes and turning them into construction sites wild toads should be left alone in their natural habitat feed your toad the type of food he will want to eat standard toad fare includes recently fed crickets waxworms and mealworms your toad s age will determine how often you feed him if you have a young juvenile toad you should feed him everyday if you have an adult toad you should plan to feed him two to three times a week 7 x research source you should give your toad

how to create a habitat for a toad,toads are fascinating amphibians known for their warty dry skin and distinctive mating calls in the warm months toads are a gardener s best friend since they eat many insects that are damaging to plants and gardens if you are hoping to make your garden more welcoming to toads there are several important things to know,make your garden safe for toads no matter how appealing and gorgeous your garden may be if it is unsafe for toads they are not likely to want to live there make your garden safe for toads by providing cover toads are very wary of predators like birds snakes and house pets and they will avoid areas where they are likely to be a meal you can create cover by providing bushes and other leafy plants for toads to hide 1 x research source avoiding chemicals toads like all frogs have thin skin and are susceptible to pesticides and herbicides in your garden 2 x research source use organic gardening supplies including dirt fertilizers and pest and weed killers choose a shady location if you re lucky you have a nice area in your yard with large shade trees that will do nicely if you don t you will have to pick a location and provide shade toads like a quiet home so choose a place where pets and children don t run wild a quiet corner of a yard is a nice place 3 x research source decide if you want to convert existing garden space or start fresh you can place a toad habitat in an existing garden as long as you don t mind sacrificing several square feet of space otherwise you can convert another area of your yard into a toad habitat toads tend to prefer to be near lots of plants of various heights so building your toad habitat as close to your garden beds as possible is best you also want an area that is out of direct sunlight for a good part of the day especially if you live in a hot and dry climate to convert existing garden space you will need to clear at least a square foot of space by pulling out a few plants choose an area in the garden that likes a lot of water since your toad will need his area to be watered quite frequently unlike some garden plants toads are not drought tolerant provide a water source you will need a water source for the toad especially if you re hoping he will make your yard a permanent home toads don t drink water but instead they soak their bodies in it to absorb what they need through their skin it is vital that you have a source of water that is big enough for the toad to soak in 4 x research source toads reproduce by bodies of water like lakes or ponds so having a small pond or ditch nearby on your property will make your yard a more welcoming home for a toad 5 x research source if you do not have a pond or other body of water nearby you can use a large pot tray the pie pan shaped container that sits under a potted plant to catch the water that runs out dig a shallow depression in your garden and place this pot there then pat the dirt around it into place so it sits securely flush with the ground around it you can place flat rocks around the lip of the dish to keep it in place fill the dish with clean water 6 x research source add plants and moss to the area you want to provide plants that the toad can hide in and you also want to attract insects to the area so that the toad can feed in the evenings try to include native wildflowers and plants of many types one favorite among american toads is creeping veronica 7 x research source to find the correct vegetation for your part of the world visit a local wetland and see what is growing near ponds 8 x research source keep it moist as amphibians toads need to be moist and have access to water at all times it s true that they don t live in the water like their close cousin the frog but they do need to have moist areas to hide 9 x research source wooden boards logs and large rocks make nice areas of cover for a frog that also stay damp add an optional toad house if you d like toad houses are cute living spaces for toads that also serve as a garden decoration they have the benefit of providing safety for a toad and also staying nice and moist which is how toads prefer their living spaces you can purchase a pre made toad house online or in garden centers or try your hand at making your own the most basic way to make a toad house is to purchase a medium sized terracotta pot and use a hammer to break a large chink out of the rim of the pot then you will turn the pot upside down and place it in the frog habitat so that the toad can access the pot using the hammered out opening as an entryway 10 x research source you can also use a dremel saw or tile saw to cut a smoother opening in the pot if you d like and you can decorate the pot by painting it and gluing on small stones or broken tiles as you d like by watering the whole area including the toad house regularly you can keep it moist inside for its lucky inhabitant add decorations to enliven the space this step is optional but there are lots of ways you can decorate your toad habitat many gardeners like to create a woodsy rustic space for toads while others like to focus on bright colors and floral designs whatever your aesthetic you can decorate your toad s habitat to match add smooth river stones around the water source which make the space feel natural and also provide a place for bugs and insects to hide small garden figurines like gnomes or fairies are great accent pieces for a toad habitat but avoid realistic looking figurines that resemble toad predators like snakes birds or large wildlife it s important to keep the safety of the toads in mind so you may want to avoid putting bird feeders bird baths or birdhouses near the toad habitat small toads are a favorite food for many birds so toads are less likely to feel welcome and safe in a toad habitat that s right next door to a bird habitat welcome your new toad friends if you re lucky and if you live by a pond or wooded area you will not have to go out of your way to get new tenants in your toad habitat you will just have to wait a few days for a toad to find the new water source and make himself at home if you don t get a resident in your toad habitat within a week or two you might want to go to a local pond or wooded area and see if you can catch one you can also purchase toads in pet stores but it is not recommended to release domestic toads into yards they may not be used to living in the wild and may not have the skills needed to survive try not to disturb the toad habitat you may be tempted to go out and make friends with the local toads but it s better to watch from a distance similarly keep pets and small children away instruct older children to observe the toad house from a distance and be sure to supervise younger children when they are in the yard if you are unable to keep your pets from the area you may need to construct a small fence around the toad habitat otherwise toads are unlikely to make the habitat their home you can gauge how comfortable the toads are in your presence by watching their behavior when you are gardening if they don t run from you you may eventually find that you can touch or even hold them just take your time water the garden every day your toad likes a moist habitat so keep the area pleasantly moist but not overly wet ensure that the water dish never runs low on water or becomes murky or dirty because you must water the habitat frequently it is important that the plants in the area prefer a lot of water to thrive otherwise you may find that the frequent watering will drown the plants or encourage root rot if you notice that the frequent watering harms the plants in the habitat you ll need to plant something else that tolerates more water consider installing a toad light in most yards bugs are plentiful and your toads will have more than they can eat without you needing to take any additional steps if you are lucky enough to live in an area without many nighttime bugs you may consider investing in a light to attract insects to the toad habitat during the evening and night any type of small garden light will do the trick but it should be no taller than three feet high install it on the periphery of the toad habitat and keep it lit at night in the warm months whenever possible,Pets-and-Animals
how to catch tadpoles,tadpoles are small larvae that will eventually turn into frogs after capturing tadpoles you can keep them as pets or re release them into the wild if you decide to catch tadpoles there are a few things you should do make sure you have the supplies prepared before you attempt to catch a tadpole once you pull tadpoles from the water with a small net or jar you ll want to be able to transfer them somewhere right away to carry them home if you choose to raise tadpoles make sure to care for them properly make sure it s safe and legal to catch tadpoles in your area before attempting to do so,gather your supplies before setting out to capture a tadpole you ll want to have certain supplies ready you can find most necessary supplies around your house if you can t locate certain supplies you can purchase them at a local supermarket or drug store 1 x research source you ll need a fine or mesh net to scoop the tadpoles out of the water you can also use a mason jar if you cannot find a net but a net will give you better control you should have something to place to tadpoles in after they are caught you should immediately place them in a container of clean chlorine free water consider bringing a bucket of water with you when you go to catch tadpoles some of the water you caught the tadpoles in may slip into the container so do not full it up completely you may want to wear gloves when catching tadpoles depending on the area where you re catching tadpoles boots may also be helpful wear boots if you re catching tadpoles in a muddy area find an area where you re likely to find tadpoles in order to capture tadpoles you ll need to know where they typically congregate you may have seen tadpoles somewhere around your home or neighborhood this would be a good place to start however if you ve never seen tadpoles before look for them in areas where they re typically found 2 x research source tadpoles tend to live in streams swamps pools and lakes tadpoles are often found near the banks of such places and in shallow water you may see them swimming in large groups occasionally frogs may lay eggs in flooded portions of grass after a heavy rain scoop tadpoles out of the water once you ve located tadpoles catching them is fairly easy you simply need to place your device in the pond stream lake or other body of water use your device to scoop up a few tadpoles 3 x research source a net works best as you can make quick scooping motions with it simply dip the net into the water near the tadpoles and try to scoop water containing tadpoles out of the pond if you do not have a net you can also use a jar however always try to scoop tadpoles some people attempt to catch tadpoles by placing a jar in the water and waiting for the tadpoles to swim into the jar tadpoles are unlikely to swim into an unknown object transfer your tadpoles to clean water once you ve caught your tadpoles immediately transfer them into a container of clean water your water should not have chlorine or salt in it when you ve caught as many tadpoles as you want you can take your container inside and transfer your tadpoles to a safe environment some of the water you caught the tadpoles in will get in the clean water as it will be hard to remove the tadpoles by hand just make sure you only get a small amount of water from a lake or pond into your clean water pick a container you can easily carry you should have something like a bucket which has a handle or a small sealable tupperware container with some holes poked in the lid you don t want to accidentally drop your tadpoles while transporting them to your home as this could potentially kill them pick the proper container you want to store your tadpoles in an aquarium or a similar type of container the container should ideally be made of glass although boxes made of foam or plastic products can also suffice you should never store tadpoles in a metal container 4 x research source shorter wider containers are better than longer narrower containers make sure the container has a lid if the container comes with a ventilation system make sure this system also has a lid tadpoles can swim into ventilation ducts and die create the right habitat unlike fish or other aquatic animals tadpoles do not require a tank with a bottom lined with mold or rocks you can leave the bottom of a fish tank bare and fill it with water 5 x research source keep the tadpole tank in an area in your home that is 95 shaded when the water gets murky remove the tadpoles using a jar or net set them aside in a smaller container and clean the tank make sure your water is safe for your tadpoles tadpoles need clean water or they will not survive make sure you re using fresh tap water do not clean a tadpole tank with chemical cleaners as even small traces of chemicals can harm a tad pool 6 x research source if you have a water filtration system like a brita filter it s a good idea to use this to filter going into your tadpole tank trace amounts of chlorine are sometimes found in tap water even a small amount of chlorine is deadly to a tadpole 7 x research source feed your tadpoles a healthy diet pet stores do sell flakes for tadpoles which you can use following the feeding suggestions on the package however if you can t find tadpole flakes you can use spinach or lettuce to create tadpole food in your kitchen 8 x research source boil spinach or lettuce for 10 to 15 minutes and then drain it well use gloves or oven mitts when draining to avoid burning your hands chop your boiled lettuce or spinach into tiny pieces put a tablespoon per tadpole in your tank once a day for example if you have four tadpoles you should feed them four tablespoons of the lettuce or spinach once a day release tadpoles if you cannot care for them a tadpole is a living thing you should not keep tadpoles as pets if you lack the resources to care for them long term if you do not want the time and commitment that goes along with tadpoles re release them into the wild make sure the area where you re catching tadpoles is safe tadpoles sometimes tend to congregate in swampy areas if you re setting out to capture tadpoles make sure the area is free of poisonous weeds and difficult terrain that could cause you to slip and get hurt wear appropriate shoes like heavy sneakers or boots if you re catching tadpoles in a swampy area 9 x research source check state regulations it is not legal to capture tadpoles everywhere some states may have laws against taking animals out of the wild even in the larval stage check the website of your local department of natural resources if you cannot find the information there you can call the dnr during office hours 10 x research source avoid capturing too many tadpoles it can be easy to end up scooping quite a few tadpoles in one motion as they tend to swim close together if you intend to raise tadpoles remember they will one day grow into frogs you do not want to be left with 10 or 20 frogs to care for stick to catching a manageable amount of tadpoles like 3 to 4 if you end up with more than you want you can release some tadpoles back into the lake or stream before taking your tadpoles home,Pets-and-Animals
how to find toads,toads are amphibians that you can find all over the world toads come in many sizes they even have warts on their bodies 1 x research source you might want to catch a toad to keep it as a pet but might find it difficult because they are often hard to find you can find toads though by checking their habitats and distinguishing them from frogs,scope out typical habitats for toads you can find toads in most parts of the world except in the south pacific and polar regions they are most common in tropical areas 2 x research source toads like gardens fields streams and ponds toads often like dark damp places that allow them to hide take some time to look for places where you might find toads including 3 x research source berry patches window wells trees 4 x research source under leaves sand lawns gardens pools of water such as ponds streams lakes and reservoirs forests meadows under rocks and logs check places where toads may find food toads eat a variety of foods including insects worms and snails 5 x research source looking for toads in the places where their food sources are may help you find them more easily look for worms in rich soft soil rain causes worms to come to the surface and this may be an optimal time to check for them and toads you may also want to check for worms and toads under old boards bricks logs or debris where the soil is moist 6 x research source find snails in shaded areas when it is cloudy outside or at night make sure you look for snails and the toads that like to eat them in cooler areas 7 x research source search during active times of the day toads are mostly nocturnal they also prefer darker spaces to rest in during the day looking for toads when they are most active during the day may help you more successfully find and capture them check for toads in the late afternoon early evening and nighttime you may also find them if you search in the early morning look for toads under things such as leaves logs and rocks if you search for them during the day keep the time of year in mind toads like many amphibians may hibernate during the winter though not all species of toad hibernate most will burrow below the frost line in the winter searching for toads according to the time of year can make you more successful in your hunt 8 x research source look for toads in the forest and woodlands grasslands yards and gardens during the summer check below the frost line during the winter and early spring you may also find toads at the bottom of lakes concealed in logs or tucked into leaf piles 9 x research source

staple every ½ to hold the cylinders together place the light or glow stick at one end of the of the cylinder and cover it with shade cloth or plastic leave the other end open for toads to enter the trap 20 x research source place the traps near bodies of water the most effective place to put your traps is near a body of water if it is winter when some toads hibernate then place the traps near refuges such as plant beds 21 x research source place the trap near non flowing water source like a swamp pond or vernal pool in the summer and spring 22 x research source put the trap near burrows and wooded areas in the late spring and early summer monitor the traps check to see if you ve trapped any toads within 24 hours of setting the traps if you didn t catch any toads keep checking the trap until you find a toad in it 23 x research source use a plastic bag or jar with pinholes or a bucket of water to transfer your toad to its new home release other animals in the trap back into the wild net a toad you may want to actively catch a toad using a net instead of traps look for the toads in the same places that you would place traps take a light or glow stick to attract the insects that toads eat 24 x research source put on a pair of waterproof shoes or boots so that you can walk through mud or water sweep the net through the water hoop first through the water when you see a toad you d like to catch you ll have to be quick so that you don t miss it avoid touching irritant secretions there are many myths about toads giving humans warts by touching their skin you can t get warts by touching the skin of toads but you may expose yourself to other irritants many toads have a so called bufotoxin on their skin which can cause other small animals death and irritation to human skin if you re going to catch the toad you found use a net or a pair of gloves so that you minimize the risk of skin irritation with a bufotoxin 25 x research source identify the basic characteristics of toads you ve located a spot to find toads and considered your motives and now you re ready to get your toad it s a good idea to know what traits identify toads some typical characteristics of toads are dry warty skin 26 x research source bumps on their heads stubby bodies 27 x research source stubby hind legs swellings behind the eyes which are the parotid glands brown or grayish color jewel like eyes slightly webbed toes no teeth unlike frogs observe different species of toads most toads have the same basic characteristics however there are 300 different species of toads across the globe they can vary in size and color figuring out what species may be in your area can help you locate toads and even find unusual species 28 x research source check with your local or national wildlife agency for toad species that you can find near you for example if you live in western europe you might find the common midwife toad 29 x research source if you re in madagascar you might find the rare red dyscophus antongilii 30 x research source people in the americas may find giant or cane toads 31 x research source you can also find these in australia 32 x research source distinguish toads from frogs you might spot a toad that doesn t match any basic characteristics you may have found a frog instead all toads are frogs but not all frogs are toads this can be confusing ask yourself the following questions if you are unsure if you found a toad or a frog 33 x research source where does the toad live frogs and toads live in similar places but frogs may live in trees you won t find any toads climbing trees is my toad chubby or slim toads are chubbier than their frog cousins they have shorter back legs which are good for hopping on the ground or walking and crawling toads may be slightly slower and less active than leaping frogs what do my toad s feet look like a toad won t have webbed feet or sticky pads on its toes frogs have webbed hind find and some may have webbed front feet some frogs have pads on their toes to help them climb trees what does my toad s skin look like frogs have smooth and moist skin toads have drier skin that feels rough and has

how to catch a toad,whether looking for a new amphibian friend or simply trying to hang out with an unexpected visitor for a while toads are generally easy to get along with familiarize yourself with where to find toads and how to safely catch and house them alternatively if your intention is to rid your lawn of invasive cane toads learn how to safely capture these surprisingly harmful creatures either way you re in luck toads are slow predictable and all around surprisingly easy to catch,find a toad you can find toads almost anywhere there is consistent moisture toads will be especially easy to find near the concrete foundation of buildings and porches after it rains check under logs near stumps and under rocks near water as well during the spring male toads will relax in pools of water and call to female toads hoping to attract company not to mention the chance to procreate once you find a toad don t make any sudden movements approach it slowly be careful not to squish the toad when moving any rocks or other heavy materials catch and handle a toad gently kneel down and cup your hands around the toad slowly but steadily cradle them gently in both hands to ensure they don t jump

handle a toad too much as the oils on your skin can hurt it after a while house a toad indoors if you re hoping to keep a wild caught toad as a pet see the corresponding wikihow article for more specific steps the first step of course is providing your toad a habitat use a ten gallon fish tank or comparable container with a tight fitting lid 2 x research source if you continue to practice your toad hunting skills each new acquisition requires about 5 gallons worth of space if you catch baby toads smaller plastic critter keepers from the pet store will be more than sufficient for housing before the toad nears full size which can be over four inches long clean the interior of the toad s enclosure once a month with heavily diluted bleach shoot for about 5 bleach and 95 water if you only intend to keep your toad for a few days a box with a reliably closing lid and no holes larger than a dime will also work provide something in which your toad can dig toads are all about burrowing so they need something they can dig into use non fertilized potting soil missed or sphagnum moss mix them together to really spoil your toad this material called substrate should be at least 4 inches deep 3 x research source know that toads are nocturnal and will likely bury themselves in the substrate during the day so don t be worried if you can t spot your toad lightly spray the substrate with water every day this will make it easy for your toad to maneuver around their domain and comfortably lounge in choice pockets of substrate replace all of the substrate every 2 to 4 months outfit the toad s home properly you also need to ensure the toad s home is appropriately decorated and kept at the right temperature similarly the proper amount of light is vital as is adequate humidity 4 x research source most importantly provide a wide shallow pool of water for your toad to soak in carefully add a piece of wood your toad will likely burrow right beneath it a hollowed out log is even more exciting as a lazy toad can simply post up inside of it as long as there is adequate substrate and you keep it clean and moist the toad will be able to regulate it s temperature room temperature is okay even with natural cooling of 10 15 degrees f in the evening toads do not need artificial lighting for warmth replace the water in their toad tubs daily feed your toad the finest crickets you can find toads eat mostly insects in the wild with growing toads eating over a dozen small insects in a single evening since crickets are readily accessible at pet stores they will be your most reliable food source 5 x research source toads will also eat minnows earthworms and other insects as well you may have to dangle non lively critters in front of your toad to bait them into attacking make sure you only feed your toad food that is smaller in size than the width of your toad s mouth toads are naturally ravenous beasts and may attempt to swallow things they probably shouldn t let your toad eat as much as it wants for fifteen minutes every evening remove any food they attempt to hoard at the conclusion of their nightly feeding session build an outdoor toad abode no joke you can literally build a toad home and soon enough you ll have a toad neighbor find a shady spot near a water source in your yard even if only a large bowl of water and stake a claim for toad habitation 6 x research source toads love small dark recesses turn a small ceramic flower pot upside down and prop it up with a rock or other natural materials leave the ground of your toad abode un floored toads like to dig favor natural landscaping if you re looking to befriend a few toads and potentially catch them from time to time just to hang out you ll want to make sure your yard is alluring to toads natural landscaping is their favorite 7 x research source create a pond or other water feature in your yard for an especially easy water feature install a bird bath at ground height a backyard pond will attract all sorts of biodiversity including toads protect existing toad habitats watersheds are particularly sensitive habitats and amphibians are especially dependent on the health of their environment 8 x research source if there s a stream or wetland on or near your property do your part to protect existing toad habitats do not allow pollution or development on or near your land consider allowing your yard to serve as a habitat for wildlife generally as a healthy natural ecosystem is best for all animals including toads find information specific to the health of your watershed online from organizations such as the environmental protection agency watch out for invasive species invasive species sometimes even toads can wreak havoc upon an ecosystem native toads are especially vulnerable to attack or competition from nonnative amphibians 9 x research source help biologists who study amphibians by participating in a scientific monitoring program online learn about the invasive species in your area and try to keep them out of your habitat so the toads you know are safe cane toads are a particularly dangerous invasive species as they can kill larger predators and even pets that eat them catch cane toads when they re still spawn finding and removing cane toad eggs is the easiest and most humane way to remove cane toads from where they shouldn t be 10 x research source recognize cane toad spawn long jelly like strands with black dots all along the strands remove strings of eggs from the water and dispose of them in your compost bury them in your garden or leave them in the sun to dry out catch cane toad tadpoles by using cane toad poison it s also preferable to catch tadpoles before they turn into toads in part because it is more humane but also because it is more effective 11 x research source place a dead cane toad inside a funnel trap and submerge the trap in a body of water where you ve found evidence of cane toad presence the secretion from cane toads shoulders will attract cane toad tadpoles helping you curb the species presence in waterways around your home by catching them before they take over completely dispose of tadpoles by burying them in your compost or garden handling adult cane toads adult cane toads do have poison glands on the back of their heads though they don t release poison unless handled roughly still protect yourself for safety 12 x research source wear gloves rubber boots and a sack to catch adult cane toads collect cane toads at night using flashlights and other concentrated light sources which will immobilize toads euthanize toads humanely though unpleasant invasive species must often be killed do so in a manner that causes no pain or stress to the toads 13 x research source put the toad s in a plastic container with airholes punched into it place the container in the fridge for at least four hours this will put the toad s into a coma like state place the container in the freezer for at least three days this will kill the toads as humanly as possible most communities that struggle with cane toad infestation will have a collection center that will kill and dispose of cane toads for you do not engage in animal cruelty do not bash toads with anything or grab them and bash them against hard surfaces aside from being incredibly inhumane bashing cane toads actually presents a risk to your safety if their poison splatters into your eyes it can temporarily blind you 14 x research source a golf club is an immature and sadistic item to touch any animal with in any way similarly spraying toads with aggressive chemicals is a vile way to treat animals in particular do not use bleach hydrogen peroxide or dettol while each of these have a reputation for killing toads they may simply maim them and cause immense pain to the animals furthermore avoid the use of chemicals to ensure that you are not adding anything that may harm other species to the

how to create a terrarium for an american toad bufor americanus,american toads are great pets for people who are interested in amphibians but want a pet that s easy to take care of to keep your pet toad happy make sure its terrarium has all of the necessities like water and substrate as well as a few extra items like plants and rocks toads are carnivores so they will need plenty of spaces to hunt and eat crickets and other insects in their tank,choose a tank that is at least 10 us gal 38 l for your toad toads need plenty of space to hide burrow and jump around upgrade by an extra 10 gallons 38 l for each additional toad to ensure that they have enough space to move about in the tank always position the tank out of direct sunlight to avoid making the environment too warm 1 x research source you can find suitable tanks of various sizes at most pet stores most of them are made of glass or plastic add a coconut fiber substrate that is at least 4 in 10 cm deep pour the substrate into the tank and level it out so the toad can find places to burrow as the toad feels more comfortable it will begin to dig and move the substrate around which is normal 2 x research source if you can t find coconut fiber substrate at the pet store opt for peat moss fill a sturdy shallow bowl with water and bury it in the substrate choose a solid ceramic bowl that s deep enough to fit your toad inside then add enough dechlorinated water for the toad to completely submerge itself and stay hydrated dig a hole in the substrate and situate the bowl in the tank pushing the substrate up to the sides of the bowl 3 x research source if you don t have a water filter to remove chlorine add dechlorinated drops to the water before you put it in the tank chlorine is very dangerous for toads and you can purchase the drops at most pet stores be sure to change the water every 2 days so that it s fresh for your pet install a thermometer and a hygrometer on the tank toads prefer cooler temperatures with high humidity place the meters on one side of the tank and check them daily the temperature should be around 60 75 f 16 24 c and the humidity should stay around 50 if the tank is too hot add cooler water to the bowl and make sure there is plenty of substrate so the toad can burrow to stay cool 4 x research source since toads prefer cooler weather they don t normally require a uv light to keep them warm if the humidity drops below 50 mist the tank with clean water 2 3 times per day until it returns to normal secure a tight fitting screen lid on the top of the enclosure for safety toads can jump pretty high and they can easily knock the lid off of your tank make sure the lid has holes for ventilation and doesn t easily move when pressed if the screen is loose the toad could escape from the tank 5 x research source always remember to secure the lid when you re done working in the tank add leaf litter or cork bark on top of the substrate so your toad can hide a normal coconut substrate can be comfortable for burrowing but toads also like to camouflage themselves under larger items sprinkle a layer of bark or leaves around the tank to create a variety of places where your toad can conceal itself 6 x research source you can find cork bark or leaf litter at most pet stores or outdoor landscape centers place a few living or plastic plants throughout the enclosure for more coverage if you want the tank to seem more like the toad s natural habitat pick up 3 4 small plants either real or fake position them around the tank to give the toad a few places where it can hide when it s not burrowing or wading 7 x research source if you re going to use real plants opt for a few golden pothos epiphyte or calathea since they re easy to maintain and safe for the toad position small clay pots and rocks throughout the terrarium to hold humidity if you want a few more places for your toad to hide that will also keep the terrarium humid lay a small clay pot on its side in the tank and add 2 3 rocks on the top of the substrate when you mist the tank be sure to spray the pot and rocks since they hold moisture and release it slowly 8 x research source be sure to keep the clay pots tipped on their sides since the toads might jump into them and get stuck if they re placed upright,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for wild southern toads,wild southern toads are interesting and exciting creatures to keep as house pets not only do they require little day to day maintenance but they can also be fun to sit and watch when they re active if you re interested in taking care of a southern toad you first have to prepare a habitat fit for a toad then go out and catch one or purchase one from a store once you ve brought your new pet home just feed it help it stay healthy and have fun with your new friend,use a 10 us gal 38 l tank to house a single toad if you intend to keep more than 1 toad in the same tank add 5 gallons 19 l to the volume of the tank per extra toad an adequately sized tank will probably be about 20 inches 51 cm long 10 inches 25 cm wide and 12 inches 30 cm tall 1 x research source for example if you plan to keep 3 southern toads together in the same tank the tank should be at least 20 gallons 76 l in volume the tank can be any ordinary aquarium or terrarium made of glass or molded plastic note that male toads tend to not get along very well so you shouldn t keep multiple males in the same habitat place substrate your toad can dig in on the bottom of the tank for best results use either coconut husk fiber unfertilized peat moss leaf litter cyprus mulch or potting soil place 2 to 3 inches 5 1 to 7 6 cm of substrate on the bottom of the tank to give your toad enough soil to dig into 2 x research source you can buy these types of substrate at any pet store that sells supplies for amphibians avoid using sand gravel or small bark shavings as substrate as your toad might accidentally swallow these and develop gastrointestinal problems as a result add natural decor to the tank that the toad can hide in this should include natural objects that the toad can burrow and hide under such as small logs and driftwood pieces as well as tilted bark for sleeping place at least 3 4 pieces of decor in the terrarium for your toad to hide under and enjoy hopping on 3 x research source you can buy these pieces of decor at most pet shops wash them with dish soap and hot water before placing them in the terrarium if you choose to use natural objects from outdoors just be sure to wash them before placing them in the tank your toad may also appreciate having a fake hollowed out log it can hide inside put a shallow bowl of de chlorinated water in the tank the water in the bowl should be about 1 inch 2 5 cm deep and should never be deeper than your toad s nose this bowl will be used by the toad for soaking and going to the bathroom 4 x research source if the water in the bowl is too deep your toad may actually drown so it s important that the water never go above the height of your toad s nose spray the substrate daily to maintain adequate humidity levels the humidity in your toad s terrarium doesn t need to be any greater than the humidity in your house but you need to prevent the substrate itself from drying out use a spray bottle to spray the surface of the substrate every morning 5 x research source be sure that you only use de chlorinated water to spray the substrate since toads are very susceptible to environmental toxins keep the temperature in the tank between 65 and 82 f 18 and 28 c place the tank in an area of your house where this temperature will be maintained and put a heating pad under 1 end of the tank this will give your toad the option of being on the heated side or the cooler side of the tank use a terrarium thermometer to monitor the internal temperature of the tank 6 x research source you can buy reptile heating pads and terrarium thermometers at any pet store that sells reptile supplies don t place your toad s habitat near an open window or air vent as it may be more difficult to control the temperature in these areas of your house look for wild toads near ponds and in marshes at night southern toads are nocturnal and are thus most active at night so you re more likely to catch a wild one after about 8 00 p m this type of toad typically lives in sandy areas marshes and mixed hardwood swamps although you may also spot them around ponds and the edges of forests 7 x research source southern toads are found in every southeastern state in the united states except tennessee note that in the northern part of their range southern toads are inactive in the fall and winter they are active year round in most of florida check for highly pronounced crests on the back of the toad s head while southern toads look very similar to american toads the highly pronounced knobs and crests behind their eyes are their most identifying features southern toads are also likely to have smaller bumps also called warts surrounding the rest of their skin 8 x research source you don t have to worry about these so called warts while some people think handling a toad will give you warts this is not actually true southern toads vary in coloring from brown to black to red unlike some other species of toad they have no dark spots on their skin southern toads are typically 1 5 to 3 inches 3 8 to 7 6 cm long cup a wild toad very gently and slowly with your hands to catch it southern toads especially young ones can be very small so you might injure them if you handle them too aggressively they are also very quick and can jump very high so avoid scaring them when trying to catch them 9 x research source if you re using your hands to capture your toad note that it may urinate on you as a defense mechanism if this happens carry the toad to a safe area and then wash your hands with soap and water you can also use a frog net or fishing net to catch a toad if you d prefer not to touch it this type of net can be found at any fishing supplies store place the toad in a ventilated container and move it to your habitat the first container should have a ventilated lid that prevents the toad from hopping out of it move the toad to the habitat you set up for it as soon as possible as it will not like being trapped in the first container at all 10 x research source feed your toad live invertebrate prey at least 2 3 times a week toads eat earwigs crickets grasshoppers minnows ants cockroaches dragonflies butterflies moths worms carpenter ants flies and other small insects whatever you choose to feed your toad make sure it s small enough for the toad to swallow whole 11 x research source toads are notoriously hungry and will eat a large amount of food if you put it in front of them however a serving size equal in mass to about 6 adult crickets should be sufficient if your toad is a juvenile instead of an adult feed it every day instead of 2 3 times a week toads recognize and appreciate a routine so aim to feed your toad at about the same time every day give your toad a vitamin supplement about once a week dust your toad s food with an amphibian multivitamin powder before serving the food to it in order to keep the toad healthy you can also gut load crickets by feeding them nutrients before feeding the crickets to your toad 12 x research source you can acquire amphibian multivitamin powder at any pet store that sells frog and toad supplies be sure to follow the manufacturer s instructions to determine how much of the powder you should give to your toad clean the habitat and replace the water in the tank every day remove any feces and uneaten food you see in the tank in the morning when you wake up perform a deep cleaning of the tank once a week by replacing the substrate and using dish soap and hot water to scrub the inside of the tank and its accessories 13 x research source be sure to remove the toad and place it in a second storage container before deep cleaning the tank handle your toad seldom although you may want to cuddle and play with your toad most toads don t actually enjoy this type of interaction especially since they scare easily be content just to watch your toad most of the time and only handle it when you need to such as to take it out of its tank during a cleaning 14 x research source always handle your toad very gently never squeezing it tightly avoid throwing or dropping your toad,Pets-and-Animals
how to raise a toad,raising toads from tadpoles is a fun process that allows you to watch one of nature s many marvels in order to raise tadpoles into toads you need to recreate their natural environment with pond water pond mud and vegetation from the pond for them to eat as they metamorphosize once you create the environment scoop up some tadpoles from a pond place them into the habitat and watch them until they transform into toads release the toads back into the wild so they will be able to find food and survive,fill a shallow container with fresh pond water a good rule of thumb is 1 l 0 26 gallons of water per tadpole you want to raise use a bottle or another sealable container to scoop water out of a pond and bring it home 1 x research source the water needs to be shallow enough that you will be able to place rocks and sticks so they are raised above the water use pond water from the same pond you plan to get the tadpoles if possible if you cannot get pond water then boil tap water to kill any chemicals used to treat it let it cool completely before putting any tadpoles in it do not use unboiled tap water or hose water because the chemicals used to treat it can kill the tadpoles put a layer of pond mud and pond grass into the container use your hands to scoop some mud and underwater vegetation from the pond and put a thin layer of it at the bottom of the container the tadpoles will eat this as they are growing into toads 2 x research source it s important to only use mud and vegetation from a pond because these will provide the proper nutrients for the tadpoles don t use sand or regular dirt as it could hurt the tadpoles put 1 rock or sticks in the container for each tadpole you are going to raise carefully place the rocks and sticks so that they are above the water each tadpole will need a natural surface to climb up on as they turn into frogs 3 x research source collect rocks and sticks from around a pond if possible so that you can recreate the tadpoles natural environment as closely as possible use a fish net to scoop up some tadpoles and put them in their new home scoop as many tadpoles as you want to raise out of a pond and place them in the container you prepared put back any that you don t have room for 4 x research source you can get a fish net at an aquarium supply store pet shop or fishing supply store don t pick up tadpoles with your hands or you risk hurting or killing them if you don t have a fish net then use a small container to scoop up the tadpoles with some pond water remember not to keep more than 1 tadpole per 1 l 0 26 gallons of water in the container keep the container where it gets a few hours of sun each day place the container somewhere in your home or outside where it will not get extremely hot or cold put it by a window or on a patio that gets a few hours of sun every day 5 x research source don t put the container anywhere where it will receive direct sun the whole day this can overheat and kill the tadpoles top off the water in the container every day with pond or rainwater collect rainwater in a bucket or visit a pond to get some fresh pond water add just enough of the water to the container so that it does not raise above the rocks and sticks in the container 6 x research source remember that the rocks and sticks you placed always need to be above the water so that the tadpoles can climb onto them when they turn into toads since tadpoles come from stagnant pond water you don t need to worry about changing the old water you just want to replace any water that evaporates to keep the water level roughly the same each day keep the tadpoles for at least 4 weeks until they turn into toads watch the tadpoles carefully during the 4th week that you have them during this week they will likely start sprouting limbs and turning into toads 7 x research source the closer they are to becoming toads the more the tadpoles will hang out around the edges of the rocks and sticks you put in their container once they turn into toads their gills will stop working and they will climb up onto the rocks and sticks to hang out release the newly formed toads into the wild near a pond the toads will stop eating the plants and mud and will need to eat insects to survive once they have completed their metamorphosis carry them carefully in their container to a pond and release them back into the wild so that they are in the environment they need to survive 8 x research source if you want to keep the toads around then you can create a habitat for them in your yard,Pets-and-Animals
how to care for fire belly toads,fire belly toads are a popular pet that can live for ten to twelve years or more if properly cared for you will need to provide your toad with the right environment a large aquarium with proper lights is important feed your toad a diet of fresh insects make sure to avoid over handling fire belly toads they tend to be private animals that need a lot of space to thrive,get the right size aquarium in general bigger is better for fire belly toads they are active animals and need room to roam around five adult toads can fit comfortably in a 15 gallon aquarium that s 24 inches long and 12 inches high by 12 inches wide 1 x research source you can buy an aquarium online or at a pet store the aquarium you use should come with a screen cover this promotes ventilation which is important for the health of fire belly toads fill the aquarium properly you should have a land and water area in your aquarium as fire belly toads are only semi aquatic the land area should be two thirds to one half of the tank you should attempt to create a natural like habitat with rocks soil moss fake plants and driftwood you can purchase these supplies online or at a pet store 2 x research source the land area should gradually slope into the water area you can use things like sand aquarium gravel and driftwood to create an incline into the water avoid using distilled water as it doesn t contain the necessary minerals your frogs need instead use tap water conditioned with the appropriate chemicals to remove chlorine and heavy metals from the water you can find tap water conditioner online or in an aquatic pet store provide lighting if you live in a cooler area or keep the tank in a cool area in your home use a small incandescent light bulb this can provide heat you should also provide a light that will give the toad uv rays which will prevent metabolic bone disease 3 x research source look for ultraviolet lights made specifically for animals such as reptiglo 4 x research source monitor the temperature fire belly toads thrive at a temperature between 71 and 78 degrees fahrenheit 22 and 36 degrees celsius the temperature should not exceed 82 degrees fahrenheit 28 degrees celsius at night you can drop the temperature as low as 61 degrees fahrenheit 16 degrees celsius you should monitor the temperature closely by keeping a thermometer in the tank if it gets too hot move the tank to somewhere cooler in your home turn on the air conditioning or use a fan 5 x research source a heat lamp may not be necessary as fire bellied toads can tolerate cool temperatures and thrive at room temperature 6 x research source spray the cage with water each day humidity is not as important to fire belly toads as it is to other amphibians however it s a good idea to spritz the tank with water using a spray bottle every day this will keep the tank adequately humid for fire bellied toads 7 x research source feed your toads crickets and mealworms live crickets and mealworms which you can buy at a pet store should be the staple of your fire belly toad s diet you should feed your toads as many crickets and worms as they can eat in a 15 minute period 8 x research source opt for smaller crickets to avoid a choking hazards 9 x research source add other insects to your toad s diet in addition to crickets and mealworms fire belly toads can benefit from having other food available you can add food sources to their water such as guppies and snails as fire belly toads are active animals they can benefit from having live food sources in their aquarium 10 x research source all food should be live fire belly toads do not recognize non living food sources and these can quickly contaminate your toad s tank supplement your toad s diet with vitamins and minerals gut load your crickets before feeding them to your toad by buying cricket food for made specifically for this purpose which you can find at the pet store you should also dust your crickets with a calcium and vitamin supplement at least once a week 11 x research source talk to your vet before offering supplements you want to make sure any supplements you use are healthy and safe for your toads 12 x research source address shedding issues fire belly toads need to shed for their health and wellbeing do not be alarmed if you see your toad crunched up in a slouching position this means it is getting ready to shed if you see your toad engaging in these behaviors it s important you help the shedding process if your toad isn t shedding correctly mist the toad with water and gently massage it until the skin slips off as fire belly toads dislike being handled this can be stressful 13 x research source if the skin still doesn t slip off with a gentle massage take your toad to an exotic veterinarian continuing to massage your toad could damage its skin you will have to increase the humidity in the tank during shedding time if you notice your frogs crouching and that their overall energy has slowed down start misting the cage twice a day instead of once a day give your toads privacy fire belly toads are not that social they dislike being handled often and need a great deal of privacy only pick up your toads when necessary and be sure to provide lots of hiding places for the toads you can buy structures for toads to hide in online or at a pet store 14 x research source wash the tank regularly you need to wash the tank regularly to keep your toads healthy the water container should be cleaned daily with mild dish detergent it should then be replaced with filtered water or de chlorinated water 15 x research source once every two months clean all items in the tank with mild dish detergent and wipe down the inside of the tank with vinegar and water one parts vinegar to eight parts water make sure to rinse all items thoroughly before returning them to the tank,Pets-and-Animals
how to kill toads,toads are often highly beneficial to your yard and garden eating tons of insect pests such as flies and mosquitoes but sometimes they can be an invasive nuisance and need to be removed there are actually a lot of simple changes you can make to your yard or garden to drive away toads and keep them from coming back without having to kill them however it s possible to humanely kill toads in a refrigerator or using specific pesticides especially if you re dealing with invasive poisonous toads like cane toads,place the toads in a plastic bag and tie it closed with a small gap for air put on a pair of gloves to keep your hands clean and pick up the toads and place them in a plastic bag such as a grocery bag or gift bag tie the bag closed so it s shut and the toads can t get out but it isn t sealed so they don t suffocate 1 x research source suffocation is a painful and inhumane way to kill toads you could also poke a few small holes into the bag to allow air in so the toads can breathe put the plastic bag into an open container place the bag into a large bowl or plastic container so they toads won t knock the bag over if they hop around don t seal the container shut or the toads could suffocate and die slowly and painfully 2 x research source stick the container in your refrigerator for 12 hours put the container with the plastic bag full of toads into your refrigerator to slowly cool down the toads until they re unconscious after about 12 hours check the bag to see if the toads are sedated 3 x research source if the toads are still active leave them in the refrigerator for another 2 3 hours then check them again remove the container and place it in your freezer for 24 hours once the toads are sedated take the container out of your refrigerator and place it into your freezer leave the toads for a full day so they re fully frozen and die painlessly after a day check the container to see if the toads are completely frozen through and dead 4 x research source some frogs can survive being frozen but toads cannot take the container out of your freezer and dispose of the dead toads remove the container from the freezer and take the plastic bag full of dead toads out of it throw the bag into the garbage to dispose of the toads or dig a hole and bury the dead toads in the ground to get rid of them 5 x research source take the toads out of the plastic bag if you plan to bury them choose a pesticide designed to kill toads specifically applying a standard pesticide to kill toads will cause them pain and take several hours to kill them the more humane option is to use a pesticide that s specifically designed to kill toads quickly and efficiently look for a toad specific pesticide to use 6 x research source you may be able to find toad specific pesticides at your local hardware store but you may need to order some online toad sprays designed for cane toads such as hopstop are effective against all types of toads use a sprayer to spray the toads with pesticide add your pesticide to a large 1 gallon 3 8 l sprayer spray the entire area that s infested with toads so the solution comes into direct contact with them 7 x research source you can find sprayers at your local hardware or home improvement store check the toads after 2 hours and dispose of them allow the pesticide enough time to effectively kill the toads after about 2 hours check the area for dead toads collect the dead toads and place them into a bag to be disposed of in the garbage or bury them in the ground 8 x research source don t leave the toads out in the open or other wildlife or pets may eat them and could get sick get rid of any night lighting that could attract insects toads eat bugs and other insects which are attracted to light if your yard has any sources of night lighting such as a lamp or a floodlight remove them to reduce the number of insects in the area which will help keep toads away 9 x research source remove sources of water from the area toads need water to survive find their food and hatch their eggs so take out any ponds or fountains in your yard or outdoor area to deter toads from gathering there avoid leaving hoses or sprinklers on that can cause standing water to pool on the ground as well 10 x research source dump out any pots that collect water after it rains keep the grass in your yard cut short tall grass collects more water and gives toads more places to hide and find insects to eat mowing your lawn regularly and keeping your grass cut short will help deter toads from living in your yard or outdoor area 11 x research source mow your lawn at least once a week to keep it cut short put out reptile repellant granules to keep toads away snake or reptile repellant granules also work to keep toads away by releasing odors that they don t like look for reptile repellant granules at your local hardware store or order some online spread them out over your outdoor area according to the directions on the packaging to deter toads from entering the area 12 x research source reptile repellant isn t harmful to toads but will keep them away from the area spread used coffee grounds over the area for a natural toad deterrent coffee grounds are pungent and cause discomfort to toads which will help keep them away from the area collect your used coffee grounds and sprinkle it over the ground where you want to keep toads away 13 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to preserve a starfish for a decoration,starfish make for great decorations when you bring them home from the beach to avoid stinking up your centerpiece though it helps to learn to preserve them properly drying them out with alcohol and learning to display them properly it s easy see step 1 for more information,make sure the starfish you find are dead already of the nearly 1500 species of starfish in the world they all have one thing in common they re slow it can be very difficult to tell if a starfish you find is living or dead but you can look for a few key signs that you ll be paying tribute to the beautiful animal by preserving it not killing it if you come across a starfish on the beach wait to touch it look at it closely is there any movement is there any bubbling from the sand underneath if so do it a favor by returning it into the water watch closely for several minutes to look for signs of life before picking it up if the starfish is brittle and unmoving it s dead and safe to take home for preservation and decoration 1 x research source clean your starfish an optional step before preserving the starfish is to take some time to clean it up for display while not essential some collectors like to submerge the starfish in slightly soapy water and dry it thoroughly before soaking in alcohol or drying in salt if you want to do a pre soak dilute a tiny squirt of liquid detergent in several cups of water and soak the starfish to get it clean don t scrub or otherwise over handle the starfish which is fragile dry the starfish thoroughly in the sun taking care to weigh down each arm of the starfish they tend to curl up some as they dry so it s important to flatten them gently between two plates to maintain a uniform flatness preserve your starfish with alcohol generally most collectors will go straight to the alcohol soak but do whatever seems appropriate for the specimen you ve collected when you get your starfish home soak it in enough isopropyl rubbing alcohol to cover the starfish and leave it alone for 30 48 hours alternatively some choose to soak their starfish in formalin one part formaldehyde and five parts water if you do this be warned that the starfish will maintain a fairly strong chemical odor for a while until it dissipates somewhat it might not matter if you re going to put it behind glass but be aware the process for this method is the same dry the starfish in the sun whatever series of steps you do to prepare the starfish and whatever you soak it in you need to let it dry very thoroughly in the sun before taking it inside especially hot sunny days are perfect for drying starfish and ensuring that they ll last weigh them down with plates you shouldn t need to weight them with books or any extra weight to ensure that the arms stay flat and even check on them regularly to make sure it s drying in the shape you want if you want it to look a certain way for display purposes 2 x research source try preserving starfish with salt one easy alternative method of preserving the starfish is to lay it out flat on a plate and cover it with a generous sprinkling of natural sea salt top it with a plate to keep the arms straight the salt crusting can work to suck any moisture out of the starfish and dry it out preserving it quite nicely you might consider doing this outside in the sun to avoid any smell and to dry it out more quickly keep them dry whatever you end up doing with your starfish displaying prominently or using for a craft project make sure it stays dry and has time to dry down to a lower level of stinky ness there shouldn t be a considerable odor but it can carry with it the smell of the alcohol for a while after you preserve it keep it in a dry place and don t jostle it too much create an ocean life shadowbox a common way to display starfish is alongside other shells urchins sand dollars and driftwood in a decorative shadowbox this can be a nice accent to an office living room or other space especially in houses near the beach use it to accent a gift wrapping instead of a bow use a starfish gluing a preserved starfish can be a cool way to highlight your gift wrapping you could also hang it with ribbon from a gift bag to liven up the package pair it with an ocean themed present for an added touch use it to decorate your dining room table creating an ocean themed centerpiece for your table is a nice way to use your preserved starfish placing shells and starfish in a simple and elegant bowl looks nice on your table from christmas to summer reminding you of the beach glue starfish to napkin rings for a nice livening up of the place setting ornament wine glass stems with starfish by tying them gently to the glass with ribbon make sure you remove them before washing the glasses fill a glass jar one of the simplest and most elegant ways to display your starfish and other sea preserves is to just fill a glass it looks nice inside or outside in formal settings or on end tables it s an instant reminder of sunny days and waves create a starfish pin carry your starfish with you by creating a nice broach or a pin and wearing it prominently clip it to your beach bag or your purse your scarf or your jacket,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a sock monkey,this classic goofy sock toy has been a favorite of children and adults for many decades 1 x research source although there are a number of steps to making this popular toy it is surprisingly easy and can be done by anyone with basic sewing skills each sock is cut to form different parts of the monkey s body and with careful following of each step you ll see your own unique sock monkey appear before your eyes in no time,find two clean socks the best ones will be ones with heels and toes in contrasting colors to the rest of the sock one sock will be used to make the body legs and head and the other will used to make the arms tail face and ears 2 x research source sock monkeys were traditionally made with rockford red heel socks which had a distinctive red heel on each sock 3 x research source if you have striped socks those work well too if your socks have cuffs a turned over and stitched section at the top of the socks be sure to undo the seam carefully the extra length created from undoing the cuff is needed for the length of the monkey avoid using socks that are threadbare or past their best this toy will look smarter and last longer if the socks are still in good condition and unstained turn both socks inside out lay one sock with the heel flat down you may have to flatten the sock against its natural crease to make this happen if it s not cooperating grab an iron and give it a quick once over draw a center line on the sock from the toe to approximately one inch 2 5cm from the colored heel this will become the split in the monkey s legs again note that the heel is actually hidden beneath the sock at this point so you may have to flip it over briefly to double check your positioning erasable fabric marker works best for drawing make sure before you cut that your line is indeed on the halfway mark a monkey with one fat leg and one skinny leg is not a happy monkey with the sock still folded flat sew up one side of your marked line and back down the other leave approximately 1 4 inch 0 6 cm between the line and each of your seams you can either use a sewing machine or sew by hand if you re using a sewing machine use your walking foot cut along the line between your two seams the monkey s legs and colored feet will now be clearly visible 4 x research source turn the sock right side out and stuff the entire thing polyfill stuffing is available at all craft supply stores the upper half of the sock will become the torso and head important when stuffing the sock monkey use small pieces of stuffing using bigger pieces may be quicker but the results aren t satisfying at all the project will come out lumpy and ugly smaller pieces leave a smooth finish it may help to use the eraser end of a pencil to gently push stuffing into place the amount of stuffing is up to you how firm do you want your monkey if the sock is thin you may want to err on the side of under stuffing as overstuffing it may cause it to stretch too much sew the head if your sock opening is the same color as the body of the sock just make a nice rounded head and stitch it shut if it is a contrasting color you will need to decide if you want to cut it off making a shorter body for the monkey and make the head as usual or use the excess coloring as a hat by not stuffing the last inch or two and cinching the opening into a cone shape to make the head stitch around the neck with quarter inch 0 6cm stitches use sturdy thread such as embroidery floss 5 x research source pull the stitches snugly until you get the size neck you want and knot the ends round out the head area with stuffing as desired and stitch the top opening shut if you are making a hat start working with the cuff gather the tip with large stitches and snug cinch them closed fold the raw edges to the center and tuck inside then stitch the opening closed winter ready cut the second sock into sections as shown though the pattern is only drawn on the top make sure to cut through both layers of the sock fold both arm pieces in half lengthwise then sew up the open side in a gentle arc around the dark ends cuff band the dark ends will become the paws and the opposites open ends are where the arm will be stuffed and then attached to the body keep all of these sections open ended make sure they re turned inside out as you work if they re not all your seams will be very rough fold the tailpiece in half lengthwise then sew up the open side and in a gentle arc around the dark end toe end as you did with the arms the dark end will become the tip of the tail and the opposite open end is where the tail will be stuffed and attached to the body fold each ear in half and cut across the crease then sew in a gentle arc following the rounded sides leaving the flat side open the opening is where you will stuff each ear and then attach it to the body noticing a pattern if you d like you can then fold the ears again forming a vertical line down the middle of the ear giving it depth like a real ear has basically pinch the edge you just sewed in and bring the two points together slip stitch the two sides together 6 x research source for now do nothing with the muzzle formerly the heel that part s saved for later flip the sewn pieces right side out and stuff them you should now have two arms two ears a tail and an unsewn unstuffed nose the tail may prove to be a bit of a problem you could try to stuff it using regular polyfill stuffing and a pencil to poke it through or you could use batting or part of an aquarium filter both the batting and the filter are a bit firmer and will create a more uniform looking tail in the long run 6 x research source attach the tail to the rump position it carefully and slip stitch it all the way around attach the arms to either side of the body you may want to position them a little higher than your natural inclination suggests this will give your sock a more monkey like posture trim away the edges of the heel piece if necessary since this will form the muzzle try to make sure the piece of fabric is uniform in color note that since the outermost edges will be covered you do not have to make them perfect fold the bottom of the muzzle under and sew it to the bottom of the monkey s chin make sure no raw edges are visible along the bottom but leave the top open for now add stuffing to make the muzzle puff out you may want to refer to existing images of sock monkeys to help you understand how this should look the best sock monkeys seem to have a muzzle that puffs out at nearly a 90º angle fold the raw edge under and stitch the top edge to the face the muzzle should take up a large amount of the area for the head don t worry about needing space for the rest of its features go ahead give your monkey a mouth along the toe line of the muzzle which should be dead center branch stitch stem stitch in a contrasting color of thread 6 x research source if you d like nostrils simply embroider two small rectangles above the mouth about 1 2 5 cm apart fold the raw edges of each ear to the inside and stitch them closed stitch the completed ears to the sides of the head they should be in line with where the eyes will be just above the muzzle make sure they stick out from the front add button eyes to give your monkey whites on the outside of his eyes glue or sew the buttons onto a bit of white felt then with thread of a contrasting color sew on the felt just above the muzzle you now have an adorable sock monkey for a normal looking monkey stick to black buttons the size of buttons you need depends on the size of your monkey and if you re giving it to a child either avoid the buttons entirely or make sure they re sewn on really well,Pets-and-Animals

how to make pom pom sheep,whether you re looking to make a cute easter decoration or just a fun craft to do with your kids a pom pom sheep fits the bill it s easy to make your own pom pom with just some yarn and a piece of cardboard so you can customize your sheep to look exactly the way you want add a simple head made of craft foam and googly eyes and pipe cleaner legs and you have an adorable farm animal to decorate your home,cut out a piece of cardboard to make the pom pom for the sheep you ll need a cardboard rectangle to wrap your yarn around for a large sheep cut a piece that s 3 inches by 5 inches 8 cm by 13 cm for small sheep cut a piece that s 3 inches by 2 inches 8 cm by 5 cm you can adjust the size of the cardboard to customize the size of sheep if you prefer after you cut the cardboard it s a good idea to wrap it in packing tape that will allow the yarn to slide off it more easily when you re finished making the pom pom wrap the yarn around the cardboard for the pom pom you need fluffy white cream brown or black yarn instead of cutting the yarn to a certain length remove an end from the ball or skein and begin wrapping it around the cardboard widthwise for a large sheep wrap the yarn around the cardboard 120 times for a small sheep wrap the yarn around the cardboard 75 to 80 times use one hand to hold the end of the yarn in place as you wrap it side by side in a single layer on the cardboard once you ve covered the cardboard start creating a second layer over the first continue working until you ve wrapped the yarn around the suggested number of times while white cream brown or black yarn offers the most realistic sheep look you can substitute your favorite color yarn such as pink or blue bend the cardboard to slide off the yarn when you ve completely wrapped the cardboard with the yarn use your fingers to bend the cardboard slightly widthwise to contract it that makes it easier to carefully slide the yarn from the card be gentle as you pull the yarn from the cardboard and make sure to hold it together so it stays together tie twine around the middle of the yarn bundle once you ve freed the yarn from the cardboard use a piece of twine to secure the bundle in the middle tie the yarn as tightly as you can to ensure that it stays together if you don t have twine you can substitute a piece of yarn however twine is stronger than yarn so it usually does a better job of holding the pom pom together cut the loops of the yarn to form the pom pom when the yarn is securely tied with the twine use a pair of scissors to cut the loops this will create the pom pom shape for your sheep after you cut the loops you may need to trim some pieces to get the look that you want for your sheep draw the shape of the sheep s head on craft foam and cut it out to make the sheep s face you ll need a piece of black craft foam use a pencil or pen to draw the shape of the sheep s head complete with ears on the foam as a guide next carefully cut the head out with a pair of scissors 1 x research source if you re not comfortable drawing the sheep s head freehand you can find templates online at various craft websites such as dad can do 1 the proper size for sheep s head will depend on how large your pom pom is it should fit on one end of the pom pom if you used dark yarn for the pom pom use white craft foam for the head you can use a craft knife to cut out the head if you prefer stick googly eyes on the head once you ve cut out the sheep s head select two googly eyes that will fit on it side by side apply your favorite type of craft glue to the back of the eyes and press them onto the foam head 2 x research source you can find googly eyes in a variety of sizes at the craft store make sure to let the glue dry for at least 5 minutes so you can be sure the eyes won t fall off when you begin to assemble the sheep fold two black pipe cleaners in half for the sheep s legs you ll need two black pipe cleaners that are approximately 4 to 5 inches 10 to 13 cm long bend the pipe cleaner in half to create a v shape 3 x research source glue the head to the front of the sheep add a dab of glue to the back of the sheep s head that you ve made carefully press it onto your pom pom and hold it for 30 to 60 seconds to ensure that it is secure 4 x research source you can use any type of glue to secure that works on fabric to secure the head to the pom pom however you may have an easier time if you use a hot glue gun thread the pipe cleaner front legs through the pom pom take one of the bent black pipe cleaners and push it through the pom pom on one side near the front make sure that the pipe cleaner is threaded through the yarn pom pom so it is secure 5 x research source some thread may come loose when you thread the pipe cleaner through you can trim any errant strands press the second pipe cleaner through the back of the pom pom after you ve secured the pipe cleaner for the front legs push the second one through the pom pom near the back pull it through to the other side to create the second set of legs 6 x research source take care with your placement of the second pipe cleaner you want to ensure that it s far enough back from the first to provide proper balance for the sheep to stand adjust the pipe cleaners to allow the sheep to stand once both pipe cleaners are threaded through the pom pom bend the four ends to create feet that help the sheep stand you may need to adjust the length of the pipe cleaners on each side to ensure that the sheep is balanced properly 7 x research

how to make a cow,cows are a favorite barnyard animal among kids of all ages if you want to make your own cow there are many different ways to do it so you can choose a craft based on the materials you have on hand,paint the spool white cover all sides of a large wooden spool with white craft paint allow the paint to dry note that the spool will be the body of the cow since you need to paint the entire spool separate the work into two steps so that the paint can dry properly paint the cylindrical side first and after it dries paint the top and bottom faces add black blotches cover the cylindrical side of the spool with spots of black paint let the paint dry these spots should extend all the way around the body and should look like the spots on a cow to make the spots more realistic give them rounded but uneven sides and try to avoid creating any patterns or symmetry when laying them out trace the spool onto card stock place one flat circular face of the spool on top of white card stock trace around this circle in pencil cut out the resulting circle you ll use it for the face of the cow note that white felt or white craft foam could also work if you do not have white card stock add detail to the face give the cow a pink snout black nostrils and two googly eyes to create the nose begin by drawing a semi circle over the bottom half of the card stock circle color in this semi circle with pink marker or paint then draw to small black ovals near the top edge of the semi circle for the eyes glue two googly craft eyes halfway between the snout and the top edge of the spool cut out two ears draw two small leaf shapes on white card stock cut out both shapes for use as the cow s ears keep the ears proportionate to the size of the face each one should be approximately the same size as one craft eye add detail to the ears use pink marker to color in the center of each ear on one side of the paper the pink center should follow the basic shape of the overall ear outline but it should only take up roughly one half to three quarters of the ear cut two rectangles sketch out two rectangles in pencil making each one long enough to wrap around the side of the spool once each should only be as wide as the width of one ear cut out both rectangles when finished each rectangle will turn into two legs one will become both back legs and the other will become both front legs add details to the legs color both tips of both rectangles in black marker these black tips will become the cow s hooves attach the paper pieces use craft glue to attach the face ears and legs to the spool let the glue dry before continuing glue the face onto one flat end of the spool position both ears over the top edge of the same end gluing them in place behind the face glue the center of one leg rectangle to the bottom of the cylindrical side positioning it near the face end of the spool repeat with the other leg rectangle putting it closer to the opposite end of the spool allow the ends of both rectangles to hang loose attach a pipe cleaner tail clip a small piece of black pipe cleaner and use craft glue to attach it to the blank flat end of the spool let the glue dry the tail should be roughly one half to three quarters the length of the spool body admire your work the spool cow is finished and ready to show off cut up the cardboard tubes you can start with two empty toilet paper rolls or one empty paper towel roll if you use the paper towel roll cut it in half refer to each half as a separate roll for the remainder of the instructions cut one of the rolls in half save one half for use as the cow s head and discard the other half cut 1 inch 2 5 cm off one end of the other roll this roll will become the body of the cow discard the excess 1 inch 2 5 cm create ear slits using pencil lightly sketch two ovals onto one end of the head piece positioning them on opposite sides of the cylindrical perimeter these ovals will become ears each one should be about one quarter the length of the tube carefully cut along three quarters of each oval outline leaving the innermost end of each oval alone fold up the cut portions so that they stick out from the sides of the tube creating ears snip and fold horn slits draw two small triangles near one end of the tube centering them in between both ears these triangles will become horns they should be smaller than half the size of one ear carefully cut along two edges of each triangle leaving the innermost edge alone fold up the cut portions so that they stick out from the side of the tube creating horns cut out two egg carton sections cut two compartments out of an empty egg carton discard the rest of the carton these two sections will become the legs of your cow one section will form both front legs and the other will form both back legs carefully cut out the front and back of both sections leaving the sides and bottoms intact paint everything white paint both cardboard tubes and both egg carton sections white allow the paint to dry you should paint both sides of the ear slits but you do not need to paint the horn slits at this time add black spots use black paint to add spots to the head and body of the cow let the paint dry when finished to create realistic spots paint spots with uneven sides avoid sharp points opting for rounded corners instead note that you should also space the spots apart in uneven intervals instead of creating patterns or symmetry define the ears and horns paint a small pink oval in the front side of each ear paint both sides of each horn gray let the paint dry the pink inner ear should follow the outline of the ear slit but you should leave some blank white space around the edge of each center attach the eyes using craft glue adhere two googly craft eyes onto the face allow the glue to dry completely both eyes should lie just in front of the ears along the length of the head place each eye in between one horn and one ear along the width perimeter of the head glue the pieces together glue both egg carton pieces onto the same side of the body roll glue the head onto the opposite side of the body roll turn both carton sections upside down so that the flat bottoms become the tops place one section near the front of the body and the other section near the back with the cow standing on its egg carton feet glue the back half of the head onto the top of the body stuff the rolls with cotton once everything dries stuff cotton balls into both open cardboard rolls use enough cotton to tightly back both rolls if you pack it tightly enough you should not need to use glue to hold the cotton in place attach the mouth cut a small piece of pink pipe cleaner out and glue it to the cotton at the front of the face the pink pipe cleaner should roughly match the diameter of the cardboard tube bend the pipe cleaner into a slight curve to give the cow a smile use glue to attach the pipe cleaner to the bottom half of the cotton at the front of the face add a tail cut a small length of white yarn use glue to attach one end to the top of the cardboard body at the back of the cow the tail should be at least as long as the diameter of the tube if not a little longer observe your work the cardboard cow is finished and ready to admire cut the toe off use scissors to cut off the rounded toe end removing roughly one fifth of the sock in the process on a standard adult sock the length of the cut portion should be between 4 and 5 inches 10 and 12 5 cm the cut toe portion will become the head of the cow save the rest of the sock for the body stuff and seal the ends stuff the cut toe portion with a small bundle of fiberfill or similar filling material leave the top 1 inch 2 5 cm empty glue or sew the ends together fold the raw open edge in by no more than 1 2 inch 1 25 cm to create a rounded head you ll need to begin by gluing the sides of the empty portion together glue the opening closed then fold it down over the stuffed bundle stitch or glue the folded material in place cut off the cuff cut off the back opening of the sock removing a portion equal in length to the original cut toe portion the cut portion should be about one fifth the length of the original sock on a standard adult s sock this should be roughly 4 to 5 inches 10 to 12 5 cm you ll use parts of this cut portion for the ears the leftover sock will be used for the body separate the cuff into two ovals cut the cuff in half parallel to the ribbing cut out one long oval from each half each oval should have roughly the same width and length of the cuff half these ovals will become the ears you can discard the rest of the cuff material stitch the sides fold one oval in half crosswise using a needle and thread blanket stitch over the the raw rounded edge repeat with the second oval alternatively you can use hot glue to hold the ear halves together lay a thin stream of hot glue around the entire edge then carefully press the raw edges into the glue with the raw edges trapped fold the oval in half crosswise sticking both ends together attach the ears to the head place the flat edge of one ear along one fold of the head repeat with the other ear and the other head fold you should be able to attach the ears with either thread or hot glue add button eyes sew two buttons two the front of the head positioning them roughly halfway between the ears and the original toe seam of the sock place the felt nostrils peel the backings off two small self adhesive round felt pads place each pad onto the original two seam of the head align these felt pads to the eyes of the cow cut slits into the remaining sock body flip the remaining sock over so that the heel faces up cut straight slits through both sides of the material from either end of the sock keep both slits as centered as possible from either end each should span roughly one half to two thirds the space in between the open end and the nearest side of the heel on a standard adult s sock the slits should be 2 to 3 inches 5 to 7 5 cm long stitch around the slits turn the sock inside out and sew along all of the raw edges leaving roughly 1 inch 2 5 cm open along the back slit as you sew along the slits and the raw open edges you should see the legs of the cow taking shape the front of the sock should form the front legs and the back of the sock should form the back legs once you finish sewing along these raw edges turn the body right side out again through the remaining gap stuff the body with fiberfill insert fiberfill or a similar material into the body of the

how to crochet butterflies,there are multiple ways to add butterflies to your crocheted works you can use a butterfly stitch to work them directly into the material or you can attach a separate butterfly applique to a separately crocheted patch of material,insert the hook into the first stitch insert the hook into the stitch indicated by the pattern at this point you should be in the middle of a crochet project and you should already have one loop on your hook the butterfly stitch is worked into two stitches and this stitch is the first of the two draw up a loop yarn over the hook once from back to front then pull the hook back through to the front of the work this should create a second loop on your hook yarn over an pull through once wrap the yarn over the hook once from back to front pull this yarn over through the top loop of your hook afterward you should have two loops on your hook when you complete this step you have completed one wing of the butterfly insert the hook into the second stitch insert the hook into the stitch immediately following the one you just worked in this is the second and final stitch you will work into while completing the butterfly stitch draw up a loop yarn over the hook once from back to front then pull the yarn and hook back through to the front of the work this should create another loop on your hook giving you a total of three loops yarn over and pull through twice wrap the yarn around the hook from back to front then pull this yarn over through the top two loops on your hook there should be two loops left on your hook yarn over and pull through twice wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front once more then pull this final yarn over through the remaining two loops on your hook you should be left with one loop on your hook the completion of this step completes a second butterfly wing chain one work one chain stitch from the loop on your hook this chain stitch completes the butterfly stitch and prepares the yarn for your next stitch work a foundation chain attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot then work a foundation of chain stitches for your project the exact chain size will vary depending on how long you want your project to be as a general rule though your chain should have an even number of stitches in it to accommodate the butterfly stitch note that you can work butterfly stitches into rows or rounds this example uses rows but the same basic principles apply to a pattern worked in the round single crochet across the chain work one single crochet into each stitch of your foundation chain this step is not strictly essential but it does give the butterfly stitch a sturdier edge to rest on if desired though you could work the butterfly stitch directly into the foundation chain or into a row made with another type of stitch half double crochet double crochet etc keep in mind that the final stitch count of this row should still be an even number chain one and turn at the start of your first row of butterfly stitches you ll need to work a turning chain of one chain stitch the turning chain increases the row height enough to accommodate the first stitch of that row without it the sides of the work would become uneven turn the work to the other side before continuing work butterfly stitches across the row starting with the first stitch after the turning chain work one butterfly stitch into every pair of stitches remember that the butterfly stitch uses two stitches from the previous row do not skip row stitches in between butterfly stitches continue working butterfly stitches into the previous row s stitches until you reach the end of the row by that point one full row of butterfly stitches will be complete chain one and turn as before work a turning chain of one chain stitch then turn the work over to the other side you will need to repeat this step in between each row from now on butterfly stitch into the wings of the previous row as before you will need to work butterfly stitches into every two stitches of the previous year repeat until you reach the end of the row the first stitch of your butterfly will go into the top loop of the first right wing of the butterfly stitch in the row beneath it the second stitch of your butterfly will go into the top loop of the second left wing of the butterfly stitch beneath it repeat as needed consecutive rows of butterfly stitches can be made simply by repeating the pattern of the second butterfly row work as many rows of butterfly stitches as desired fasten off the work when you complete the final stitch of your project you ll need to fasten off the yarn after fastening off the yarn the project is complete cut the yarn leaving a tail 4 inches 10 cm long grab this yarn tail with your crochet hook and pull it through the loop already on the hook this should form a secure knot and fasten off the yarn weave the remaining tail into the back of the stitches to hide it create a foundation ring attach the yarn to your crochet hook and work five chain stitches from the loop slip stitch the first and last chains together to form a ring note that the yarn should be tied to the hook using a standard slip knot single crochet into the ring chain one then single crochet three times into the center of the foundation ring the chain at the beginning of the round acts as a turning chain it sets the height of the round to accommodate the height of the single crochet stitch chain and slip the first wing work a series of 16 chain stitches from the loop on your hook upon reaching the end of this chain slip stitch into the last single crochet you made doing so will create one of the large upper wing halves of the butterfly single crochet into the ring work three more single crochets into the center of your foundation ring chain and slip the second wing work 11 chain stitches from the loop on your hook slip stitch the final chain of this group into the last single crochet you made this step will create the smaller lower half of the wing you started previously after completing this step one full wing is finished mirror the small wing half repeat the previous two steps to work the second small wing half of the butterfly single crochet into the foundation ring three times chain 11 times slip stitch the last chain to the last single crochet mirror the large wing half repeat the same steps used to complete the first upper wing half to work a second upper wing half single crochet into the foundation ring three times chain 16 times slip stitch the last of these chains to the last single crochet you created after completing this step both butterfly wings should be complete close the circle single crochet once into the foundation ring then join this single crochet to the very first single crochet you worked using another slip stitch at this point the shape of the butterfly is complete fasten off the yarn cut a tail roughly 2 inches 5 cm long pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the yarn weave the excess tail into the stitches to hide it after fastening off the yarn the butterfly is complete and ready to attach to another separately created crochet work position the butterfly over the work place the butterfly applique over the work you wish to attach it to consider pinning it in place to prevent it from moving around as you attach it if you want to attach the butterfly applique using surface crochet as these instructions will demonstrate you must attach it to a previously created crochet work you can attach it to other materials as well but you will need to do so by sewing it on or gluing it in place make sure that the butterfly is perfectly positioned over the work before proceeding surface slip stitch down the center work a straight line of surface slip stitches onto the material beneath the butterfly trapping the bottom and top of the butterfly s center beneath those stitches work one surface slip stitch onto the first stitch of the material this stitch should fall directly beneath the bottom center of the butterfly work your next surface slip stitch over the bottom center stitch of your butterfly this stitch should be worked onto the next stitch of your crocheted material just to the inside of the butterfly s center continue working surface slip stitches onto the bottom material and up the center of the butterfly make as many stitches as necessary to reach the top of the butterfly your final surface slip stitch should be worked onto the stitch of the material just outside of the butterfly s center it should also be worked over the top center stitch of the butterfly applique bind off the yarn once you ve attached the butterfly cut the yarn leaving tail roughly 3 inches 7 6 cm long pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the butterfly and secure its place on the material beneath if you do not want to add antennae make sure that the tail lies to the wrong side of the material weave the excess into your stitches to hide it then stop at this step if you do want add antennae leave the tail on the outside of the work and continue onto the next step split the strands into antennae use your thumbnail to carefully split the tail of your crochet yarn into two even halves unwind these halves down to the knot then straighten them out so they point in opposite directions forming antennae for the butterfly if you cannot use your thumbnail to split the yarn consider using an embroidery needle the blunt edge of your scissors blade a straight pin or a similarly thin tool consider knotting the ends of the divided antennae to prevent further fraying from occurring alternatively apply a small dot of seam sealant liquid to the ends of both antennae to accomplish the same purpose after completing this step the butterfly is complete,Pets-and-Animals

patterns and colors to make the bow you place between your minnie mouse ears,gather the material for making your mouse ears you will need black felt to give your mouse ears color and texture a cardboard core will give your fabric rigidity and form if you don t have any cardboard you might be able to layer several pieces of rigid construction paper together with glue as a substitute the material you use for the ears should be stiff enough to keep it from flopping around loosely once attached to the headband and if you don t have felt you can paint or color the cardboard black 1 x

source the tabs will on the bottom of your circles will be used to secure the ears and the headband together you might be able to use the base of a bowl to help you in drawing identical circles for both of your templates outline your felt circles onto your felt place your paper template on top of the felt and trace the circle with chalk onto it you could use a piece of tailor s chalk or even regular chalk in a pinch this way you can wipe any leftover chalk away with a damp cloth make four felt circles for every pair of ears you make you will need to glue felt to the front and back of your

cardboard and felt pieces together in a stack then you can trim down any irregularities glue the felt to the cardboard household glue should be sufficient to attach a piece of felt to the front and back of each cardboard circle ear drizzle glue back and forth along the cardboard and press your felt into place press the felt to the glue firmly for five to ten minutes help it set to create the best bond between your glue and the felt you may want to allow your glue to rest for 30 minutes to an hour spread hot glue along the tabs of the ears regular household glue won t hold up to wear and tear as well as hot glue the special glue used in hot glue guns however is much more durable it will create a firm bond between ear and headband you ll have to move quick after you apply your hot glue the glue will dry quickly soon after application hot glue fresh from the gun will be very hot be careful not to burn yourself 8 x research source hot glue the tabs of your circles to the underside of the headband your circles should be at least 4 10 cm apart so that you have room for the bow that will go between the ears you may want to mark your headband with your chalk where you ll be attaching the ears to prevent yourself from gluing them into the wrong place 9 x research source if your headband is flexible or will permit the use of staples you could also use a hardy stapler to connect the tabs of your mouse ears to your headband allow the glue to dry thoroughly playing with your mouse ears before the glue has completely dried could cause your mouse ears to come free of the headband to ensure you don t have to re glue any of your pieces together you should allow your glue to firm for 30 minutes to an hour style the ears into position your mouse ears might not stand straight up like minnie mouse s at first to encourage your mouse ears to hold this position fold both up and forward the glued tabs will keep the ears in place measure and cut a 10 25 cm length of ribbon or fabric you can use either ribbon or fabric for your bow although ribbon will likely be a little shinier and look more like the bow minnie wears in either case it should be 5 to 8 12 7 to 20 3 cm wide you will eventually gather this fabric around its middle which will cause the sides to fan out this will give your bow its shape 10 x research source thicker cuts of fabric will create more bunching when you gather this piece around its middle which will give your bow a fuller appearance 11 x research source 12 x research source measure and cut a 3 7 6 cm gathering string this is the piece you will use to gather the fabric around the middle of your 10 25 cm length of ribbon you should use a similar kind of fabric to your 10 25 cm ribbon but you could also add some pop to your design by using a contrasting color fabric 13 x research source for example if you are using minnie s traditional bow color red with white polka dots you might choose a bold blue for your gathering string lay the 10 25 cm piece of ribbon on a flat surface put the print side face down you re going to want to glue your gathering string along the back of your bow which will be the same as the opposite side of the pattern fold the long ends your 10 25 cm ribbon toward its center you ll want each side to overlap slightly at the center of your 10 25 cm length of ribbon fold one end at a time so that there is enough overlap to glue these side where the meet at the center of the ribbon 14 x research source glue the folded inward ends at the overlap it should only take a dab or two of hot glue or fabric glue to join the ends together firmly press the fabric firmly to create a stronger bond between the fabric and glue you should follow the directions on your glue to achieve the best bond some glues will set and cure faster than others generally you should hold the glue firmly for one to five minutes for best results arrange your ribbon into a bow shape use one hand to pinch your ribbon together toward its centermost point from the top and bottom edges this will be easiest to do if you are working with a ribbon that is at least 5 12 7 cm wide pinching your ribbon together tightly will cause the outside edges to flare out more dramatically loosely wrap your gathering string around your bunched ribbon the 3 7 6 cm piece of ribbon will hold the fabric of your bow in its flared position wind it around several times and then remove your fingers where you were pinching the bow in the middle hold the ribbon with your free hand to make sure it doesn t come unwound or loose wind the remaining length of your ribbon around the center tightly glue the gathering string in place lift one end of the small piece of ribbon and apply a dab of hot glue or fabric glue if using hot glue you should be careful not to burn yourself by pressing on the fabric immediately after glue application 15 x research source to apply pressure to make the best seal between your hot glue and fabric you might use a tool to prevent getting burned like a paperweight gloved hand or tweezers fabric glue and other cold glues should be held together firmly to encourage a strong bond press the glued piece of ribbon together hold this position for about 30 seconds to a minute slip a pipe cleaner through a fold in your bow the bunchings of your bow fabric should have created folds through which you can thread your pipe cleaner so that it passes under your glued gathering string if you find it difficult to feed your pipe cleaner through a fold and under your gathering string you can always use glue to attach the pipe cleaner along the back of your bow a dab of hot glue onto the back of your gathering string should be enough to hold your pipe cleaner in place cross one end of the piper cleaner over the other orient your pipe cleaner so it is equal length on both sides of your gathering string now cross the sides of your pipe cleaner at the midpoint over the front of your gathering string and add a twist this will prevent the pipe cleaner from slipping out of the bow while adding stability to the bow in general experiment with different colored pipe cleaners to personalize your minnie mouse ears secure your bow with the loose ends of the pipe cleaner center the bow between the ears then you re going to wrap each end of the pipe cleaner around opposite ends of your headband twine each side of the pipe cleaner down opposite ends of the headband until you go no further the ends of pipe cleaner can be pointy to prevent the wearer from getting poked you may want to turn these inward on your headband the ends can also be taped to the headband as an extra precaution by attaching your bow to your mouse ears with a pipe cleaner you ll be able to swap out different bows without having to make a new pair of mouse ears twist ties can be used to reinforce your pipe cleaners if you find the pipe cleaner windings are not holding the bow in place well enough add finishing touches and show off your mouse ears minnie being a stylish mouse would probably go ga ga over some rhinestones glitter feathers or other accents you might add to your mouse ears most of these can be attached with a small dab of hot glue once you ve finished adding your finishing touches you should show off your mouse ears to all your friends,Pets-and-Animals
how to make felt animals,arts and crafts are always a lot of fun but have you ever tried making felt animals it s a challenge but also pretty rewarding you can make large or small animals depending on how much time you re willing to commit to the process felt animals are great for gifts or just to keep around the house the best thing is they re pretty easy to make,buy some felt and stuffing obviously if you want to build a felt animal you re going to need some felt poly fill stuffing is most common but you can also buy cotton or even bead if you would prefer to work with that material stuffing is important to give your animal some structure you can buy both these materials at an arts and crafts store download your pattern piece there are many pattern pieces that you can find out on the internet pattern pieces are traced onto the felt and then cut out so that you have all the component pieces of your felt animal you can also try creating your own pattern piece if you want to make a simple animal like a snake your can use four very elongated football shaped pieces make sure all your football shaped pattern pieces are the same size measure the width of each piece at its midline to figure out how wide your snake is going to be take that number and multiply it by four to get the circumference of your snake use this information accordingly as you make the body you ll want the length of the snake to be four times larger than the circumference of the snake make sure you have enough felt that s the idea behind making pattern pieces you can add eyes and a tongue with extra fabric remember to leave 1 4 of an inch extra room in the pattern piece for sewing purposes gather your scissors stitching and sewing supplies if you don t already have these supplies you can buy them at an arts and crafts store too you can use a sewing machine if you have one available but felt is easy to work with you can just use a needle and thread cut out the pattern pieces from the felt you ll want to enlarge your pattern piece to the size you want your animal to be make sure that you allow for a 3 millimeter seam allowance that means you need that much extra space for the animal to fit together once you stitch it for example if you were sewing a mini dog together you would have eight pattern pieces in all two body pieces two head pieces one belly piece one back piece one crown piece and one tail piece 1 x research source a snake would only have the long four football shaped pieces start stitching the corresponding pieces together for example if you were making the mini dog you would start by sewing the body and head pieces together in the pattern piece layout there will be letters that correspond with where each part connects for this little dog you ll be sewing the two head pieces on top of the two body pieces 2 x research source sew the two body pieces together now you ll connect the two pieces you won t be sewing all the way around obviously only sew the top half of the body together as the letters indicate for example if you were making this little felt dog you would start to see the outline of your animal 3 x research source if you made your own pattern pieces for the snake you ll just want to connect each of them to form a cylinder add your connecting and additional pieces for example if you were making the little felt dog you would need to add the crown piece to the top of his head once the body pieces are together you can start to figure out how to fill in the gaps the little felt dog also requires a brown speckle on his back to fill in the hole on is back connect your belly piece the belly piece is generally one of the last pieces to add using the little dog as an example you would turn the body pieces upside down and add the belly piece to the bottom around the edge don t forget to leave an opening you absolutely need this opening so that you can stuff your animal if you forget to leave the opening you ll have to undo your stitching or start all the way from the beginning the little dog example has a hole already built in for stuff but you might need to leave your own hole 4 x research source turn your animal inside out the little dog pattern piece leaves a hole in the stomach for you to turn your animal inside out but you might need to leave your own hole if you are making a different felt animal stuff your animal using the whole you left stuff your animal thoroughly with polyester fiberfill make sure the animal is well stuffed but not over stuffed you want the animal to feel firm without looking like it is going to explode use your judgment 5 x research source add your embroidery you can add whatever pieces you want the little dog calls for small beads for eyes and some black string for the mouth and nose you can add designs all over the felt if you desire though the snake embroidery would consist of little sewing on black circles of fabric or string for eyes and a little piece of red felt for the tongue draw a tongue that appeals to you most snakes have forked tongues stitch up your final body pieces this would be the time to add ears tails or whatever else your animal might have connected to their body the little dog will have a tail stitched to the back of his body and two ears connected on top remember to turn your body pieces inside out after you sew them to hide the stitching 6 x research source follow the letters on your design piece if you aren t sure what pieces are added where look at which letters correspond to what pieces for example if you are adding ears to the top of a dog there will be the same letter on the ears as on the top of the body piece anywhere with matching letters is supposed to be connected with stitching 7 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to knit a teddy bear,if you want to give a simple gift this year consider knitting a teddy bear there are many different ways to make and knit teddy bears but by following some steps you will have a cuddly teddy bear in no time although this is a basic teddy bear pattern it requires familiarity with knitting techniques and is not for beginners,choose your yarn and needles choose your yarn based on the color bear you would like to make you want the knitting to be dense enough that the stuffing does not show through the material so use needles 2 3 sizes smaller than you would normally use for the yarn you have chosen 1 x research source cast on 40 stitches casting on is the process of starting the first stitches on the knitting needle before beginning to knit there are many different methods for casting on depending on your experience level and the look you want to try easy beginner methods include the backwards loop cast on and the long tail cast on knit in garter stitch for 32 rows garter stitch is great for this project because it forms a sturdy and flexible piece of knitting it is also a good stitch for beginners to learn and you can remember it with the poem back around over and under place a colored thread on the last row when you reach row 32 place a colored thread in the middle of the row to mark the location of the neck continue to knit an additional 34 rows keep knitting in garter stitch for an additional 34 rows so that you end up with 66 total rows at each end of this final row place a colored thread these colored threads mark where the body stops and the legs begin knit 20 stitches and continue for 39 rows knit 20 stitches which is half the width of the pattern and then continue for an additional 39 rows cast off at the end of these 40 total rows this is your first leg turn the pattern around and stitch the other leg turn the pattern around and rejoin the yarn to the other 20 stitches on the body of the pattern knit 40 rows on this side of the pattern completing the other leg once finished cast off these stitches knit the first arm starting on a new section cast on 20 stitches and then knit 40 rows cast off this forms one of the arms of your teddy bear and will be attached later repeat this for the other arm again cast on 20 stitches and then knit 40 rows to create the piece for the second arm of your teddy fold the body in half to create the head and body bring the left edge of your pattern to the right edge and sew down the edges to connect them sew them together from the top edge of the pattern where you cast on to the row with the marker at the top of the legs rotate the shape so that this seam is on the back of the teddy bear use a blunt tipped needle to sew the pieces together to make it easier if you are a beginner then you can use the backstitch to sew the pieces together starting from one side simply push the needle down through both layers and bring around the edge and push down through the same location to begin then move over one quarter inch and bring the needle back up through both layers continue stitching until you reach the end of the seam sew the inside leg and foot seams now that the seam is on the back of the teddy bear there will be two pieces at the bottom that will form the legs sew from the top of the legs all the way down the inside seam to the bottom foot seam to close the legs do this on both legs you can again use the backstitch to sew the seams stuff your teddy use cotton or any type of stuffing to fill the teddy bear do not overstuff but fill the teddy completely including the legs and feet sew the head closed sew the top seam of your pattern shut to close the head try to round the corners slightly if possible again you can use the backstitch to connect the seams fold the arm pieces in half and sew along the edge fold the arm pieces in half lengthwise and sew along the long end and the bottom edge to make the arms and hands you can again use the backstitch to sew these seams together if you would like stuff the arms and sew them closed stuff the arms with the same material you used for the body of the teddy bear then close the tops of the arms attach the arms attach the arms of the teddy bear to the body using a simple backstitch or other stitch that you prefer the arms should be attached just below the neck on each side sew across the corners to make the ears sew a rounded edge across the corners to connect the two layers and make the edges stick out like ears to make them stick out a bit close your fingers at the base of the ears and pull them lightly before and after stitching you can also do a gather stitch at the base of the ears to help them to stick out more to knit a gather stitch you would knit a decrease across the length of the ear with a smaller needle size than you have been using gather around the neck do a gather stitch around the neck where you placed the marker for the neck again you would knit a decrease at this location to bring the neck in and differentiate the head and body decorate your bear embroider the ears and face of use buttons for the eyes you can also tie a ribbon around the neck of the teddy bear you should also remove the markers you used earlier hug your new teddy bear enjoy your stuffed teddy bear or give it to a friend,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper butterfly,paper butterflies are not only dainty and chic they re also fun to make try your hand at origami to create one or if you re more of a crafting beginner fold a simpler version with pretty pleats when you re finished use your butterflies as decor or give them to friends and family as gifts,fold the paper in half then open it and fold it in half the other way make sure to crease both of the folds line up the edges when you re folding to ensure the crease is directly in the center 1 x research source if your paper is the same color or pattern on both sides it doesn t matter which side you start on however if one side is white or the backside begin with that side facing up fold the paper in half diagonally open it and fold on the other diagonal bring 2 opposite corners together to create the folds press down firmly to create defined creases repeat on both diagonals open the paper to lie flat after you fold it 2 x research source your 4 folds should intersect in the exact center of the paper bring the right and left creases together creating a triangle with the paper laying flat in front of you press the right horizontal crease to the left one as you do this the paper should collapse onto itself in a triangle shape along the diagonal creases you made 3 x research source press down on the triangle to crease the paper once it s collapsed if the paper isn t folding properly go back over your original creases again if they aren t defined enough the paper will have trouble falling into the shape fold the 2 top corners into the center when you created the triangle shape it made 2 layers grab the corners on the top layer and line up their edges with the crease in the middle of the triangle 4 x research source try to align the corners with the crease perfectly so they aren t overlapping or so there isn t a large gap between the edges in the center flip the triangle over and fold the bottom up leaving a small tip showing you aren t folding it completely half instead you re folding it about 1 3 up from the base of the triangle hold the fold in place gently with your hand 5 x research source don t crease the fold bend the top layer of the tip over the base there are 2 layers at the tip of the triangle peel the top 1 forward folding it over the wide triangle bottom you re currently holding in place the tip will be the head of the butterfly 6 x research source crease the fold that you make with the tip this will help secure the body of the butterfly in place and prevent it from unraveling pull down the pieces from the bottom layer to create the lower wings with the top layer folded over bring the bottom layer of the tip in the opposite direction the points of the 2 triangular pieces should be facing down away from the folded head 7 x research source it may help to hold the folded tip with your thumb while you pull the other pieces down so that the butterfly doesn t come apart re crease the folded tip after you arrange the bottom pieces if necessary trim the edges of the wings if you want a smaller butterfly fold the square piece of paper in half creasing it line up the edges of the paper when you fold it to make sure you re creating a line directly down the middle press firmly with your fingernail to form the crease 8 x research source use any type of paper you d like whether it s origami paper colorful cardstock or even pretty gift wrap the size of your paper doesn t matter as long as it s square if you have a rectangular piece simply trim it down so all of the edges are the same length unfold the paper and cut along the crease line use your scissors to cut the piece of paper in half the groove of the crease should help guide your scissors in a straight line through the paper 9 x research source make sure your scissors are sharp so they don t tear or crinkle the paper if you have trouble cutting in a line hold your scissors against a straight edge like a ruler while you cut make accordion folds with one of the pieces of the paper fold a small piece lengthwise then flip the paper over to fold it back onto itself continue flipping the paper from side to side as you fold along the entire length of the paper think of this motion as similar to making a pleat or a fan 10 x research source you can make the folds as thick or as thin as you d like keep the folds all the same thickness no matter what size you choose take the other piece of paper you cut and fold it in half lengthwise place the 2 longer edges on top of each other then create a crease by pressing down along the fold 11 x research source try to make the crease as straight and even as possible so it splits the paper directly in half open it up and fold the 4 corners in toward the center crease line line up the edges straight along the crease your paper will now be in the shape of a hexagon with 2 pointed ends formed by the folded corners 12 x research source leave the corners folded if they won t stay in place use a piece of double sided tape or a little bit of glue under the flap flip the paper over and make accordion folds on each side of the crease fold one half the paper in towards the center then repeat on the other side this will be the top half of the butterfly s wings 13 x research source make the folds as large or as small as you d like depending on the size of your paper bend both pieces of pleated paper in half press the pleats together and hold the paper between your thumb and forefinger carefully fold one end onto the other creasing it firmly 14 x research source the paper won t stay folded but that s okay you just want to make a crease so the paper is in a v shape place 1 piece above the other and tie them together at the center arrange the 2 pieces so that they form a butterfly shape pinch them together while you tie string or cord around both pieces 15 x research source to secure the 2 pieces together better you can add a dab of craft glue or hot glue in the middle having a friend hold the pieces together while you tie the string makes it easier to get a tight knot you can also use ribbon or a pipe cleaner instead of string pull out the pleats to open up the wings scrunched up folds don t exactly resemble a beautiful butterfly gently pull the pleats apart so that the 2 pieces of paper look like 1 large wing on each side instead of 2 disjointed ones 16 x research source be careful not to rip the paper when you re arranging the pleats,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper dinosaur,with the right supplies and a bit of time you can make your very own paper dinosaur that stands or moves if you d like a bigger craft project you could even attempt a paper mache dinosaur or an origami dinosaur depending on the colors that you use you can make your dinosaur look realistic or cartoonish,glue a sheet of green construction paper to a piece of thin cardboard this will make your dinosaur nice and sturdy if you don t have any green construction paper paint the cardboard with green acrylics or poster paint let the glue or paint dry before moving on 1 x research source the thin cardboard from cereal and snack boxes works great for this if you don t have thin cardboard or construction paper try green cardstock instead you can also use poster paper but you ll need to paint it draw and cut the body head tail and leg shapes from the paper look up coloring book or cartoon pictures of long necked dinosaurs then break it down into separate body parts draw these separately with a pen or pencil then cut them out here are the basic shapes you ll need 2 x research source a long stem with an oval shaped head like a brontosaurus or apatosaurus a long tapering tail like a skinny triangle 2 rectangular legs a mound or lump shaped body like a semicircle but with rounded bottom corners make spikes for the dino s back using paper and cardboard if desired glue the paper to the cardboard first or paint the cardboard let the paint or glue dry then draw 4 to 5 triangular spikes cut them out then set them aside 3 x research source use a different color of paint or paper for this orange is a great choice but a lighter or darker shade of green will also work you can also make smaller rectangles for nails use a pen to poke a hole in the ends of each limb make the holes 1 4 to 1 2 in 0 64 to 1 27 cm away from the center of each edge a pen or pencil will work just fine for a cardstock dino but if you used thin cardboard use a nail to make the holes instead 4 x research source you ll need holes in the following areas base of the neck base of the tail and the top of each leg don t use a hole punch the hole will be too big and the brad will fall through if you re a child ask an adult to help you with this step especially if you re using a nail poke 4 holes in the body so that you can secure the limbs make 2 holes along the wider flatter bottom edge of the body poke another set of holes on the sides of the body for the tail and legs as with the limbs make the holes 1 4 to 1 2 in 0 64 to 1 27 cm from the edges 5 x research source don t poke the neck and tail holes too close to the top make them closer to the bottom so that your dinosaur has a humped back don t place the legs too close together keep them closer to the bottom corners of the body use brads to secure the limbs behind the dinosaur s body stick a brad through the front of the neck hole on the body slide the neck piece onto the back of the prong behind the body pry open the back of the brad then press the prongs flat against the back of the dinosaur 6 x research source repeat this step for the tail and both legs always add the limbs to the back of the body not the front make sure that the limbs are facing up as well otherwise your dinosaur won t match brad prongs can hurt if they get under your nail consider using a butter knife to pry them apart glue the spikes to the back of the dinosaur flip the dinosaur over so that you can see the back draw a line of glue along its back then add the triangular spikes make sure that the flat bases are touching the dinosaur s back while the pointy tips are sticking out 7 x research source if you made nails for the dino glue them to the bottom of each leg white school glue and glue sticks will work just fine for this hot glue is not recommended because it s too bulky give the dinosaur a face here is where you can get a little creative for a simple dinosaur use a black marker to draw an eye and mouth for a fancier dinosaur use hot glue or white school glue to attach a googly eye to the dinosaur s face 8 x research source give your dinosaur more character by adding eyebrows or eyelashes fold and cut a plain white paper plate in half with scissors fold the plate in half first then use the crease as a cutting guide for best results use the kind that s made from cardstock and has a frilled edge rather than the kind that s made from thick cardboard with a rim 9 x research source set aside 1 of the paper plate halves this will make the body cut a dino head tail and spikes from the other paper plate half draw the shapes on the second paper plate half the other one will be the body then cut them out make sure that the limbs are proportionate to the body don t worry about the feet you will be using toilet paper rolls for that 10 x research source make the spikes about 1 in 2 5 cm tall and wide make the tail about 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm wide at the base and about 1 2 to 2 3 the length of the paper plate if you don t know how to draw a dinosaur head tail or spikes look at pictures of cartoon dinosaurs online or in coloring books use the brim to make the neck if desired cut it off first so that you get a c shape then cut it in half use 1 of these halves to make the neck glue the cut shapes to the other paper plate half the straight edge of the plate is the bottom of the dinosaur while the curved side is the back glue the tail to 1 end and the neck and or head to the other if you made spikes glue them down the dinosaur s back 11 x research source use scissors to cut an empty toilet paper roll into thirds keep 2 of the segments and discard the third this will give you rings that are a little over 1 in 2 5 cm tall if you don t have any empty toilet paper rolls you can use an empty paper towel roll instead 12 x research source if you re using an empty paper towel roll cut 2 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm segments from it cut a set of slits into the top of each toilet paper ring you will be sliding the dinosaur s body into these slits so make sure that they are directly across from each other the easiest way to do this would be to squish the rings in half then cut a 1 2 in 1 3 cm long slit into each one 13 x research source slide the dinosaur into the slits take the first roll and turn it so that 1 slit is facing the dinosaur s head and the other is facing its tail slide the bottom edge of the dinosaur s body into the slit repeat this process for the other leg 14 x research source slide the legs apart until they are on opposite sides of the plate paint the dinosaur then let it dry acrylic craft paints will work great for this but you can also use poster paint too use the same colors and patterns for both the front and back how long it will take for the paint to dry depends on what you are using expect to wait about 15 to 20 minutes however 15 x research source you can take the dinosaur s body off of its feet in order to paint it do the front first let it dry then do the back don t forget to paint the eyes and mouth alternatively you can glue on some googly eyes after the paint has dried blow up a balloon tear newspaper into strips and make a papier mâché paste blow up a balloon to your desired size next tear some newspaper into narrow strips about 1 by 3 in 2 5 by 7 6 cm lastly prepare your preferred papier mâché glue or paste 16 x research source the most popular papier mâché paste is just 1 part water and 1 part pva glue white school glue start with just 1 or 2 sheets of newspaper you can always make more strips don t cut the strips or the edges will be too sharp and create creases tearing them will give you a smoother finish dip the strips into the paste then apply them to the balloon run each strip of newspaper between your fingers after dipping it in the paste this will remove any excess glue make sure that the strips are all going in the same direction as you apply them 17 x research source overlap the strips a little such as by 1 4 to 1 2 in 0 64 to 1 27 cm keep the balloon in a cup or bowl so that it doesn t roll around you may have to let 1 side of the balloon dry first before doing the other leave a coin sized space at one end of the balloon exposed so that you can pop the balloon later apply 2 more layers of papier mâché you probably don t need to use the glue for the second layer the wet strips already adhered to the balloon should be enough for the new ones to stick to if the balloon starts to get too soggy however let it dry a bit then continue working consider using white tissue paper for as a fourth and final layer this will give you a smoother base and help the paint show up better if you choose to use tissue paper then make sure that you tear it into 3 by 1 in 7 6 by 2 5 cm strips as well let the strips dry overnight then pop and remove the balloon you may have to wait even longer than that depending on how dry or humid it is in your home in fact it would be a good idea to poke your finger under the papier mâché if it feels wet give it a little more time 18 x research source this completes your dinosaur s body don t worry about the hole left by the balloon you ll end up covering it with the dinosaur s head or tail tape paper towel roll segments to the balloon for legs turn the papier mâché balloon on its side then use masking tape to secure the legs to the bottom 19 x research source don t use clear tape it won t stick to the papier mâché you can also just cut 2 empty toilet paper rolls in half and use those instead use cardboard paper towel tubes and foil to make the other limbs scrunch up aluminum foil into a ball to make a head and then use aluminum foil shaped into a cone for the tail the size and shape for each depends on what type of dinosaur that you re making so look at some reference pictures here are some more ideas to get you started 20 x research source triceratops cut a round scalloped shape out of cardboard for the fan use foil to make the horns stegosaurus cut triangles out of cardboard for the fins apatosaurus brontosaurus use a paper towel tube to make the neck tape the pieces to the body with masking tape take 1 of your pieces and hold it against the balloon where you want it to go secure it with strips of masking tape until the seam is completely hidden again don t use clear tape because it won t hold triceratops tape the fan to the balloon first then add the head you may have to use hot glue to secure it finish by sticking the horns to the head stegosaurus tape or hot glue the head to 1 side of the body and the tail to the other use strips of tape to add the fins down the back and tail apatosaurus brontosaurus tape the head to the long neck first then tape the head to the body add the tail to the other side of the body cover the pieces and the seams with more papier mâché start by applying strips of papier mâché to the seams after that cover the shapes themselves if the pieces feel unstable add more papier mâché to the seams 21 x research source you may have to tear more strips of newspaper and prepare more papier mâché paste for this consider making some smaller strips for sharp curves and tight corners if the hole from when you removed the balloon is still visible cover it up with more papier mâché wait for everything to dry how long it will take for your project to dry really depends on what the weather is like papier mâché will dry a lot faster on a hot dry sunny day than on a cold wet day be patient 22 x research source paint the dinosaur as desired then let the paint dry acrylic craft paint will work just fine for this but you can use poster paint too you can use realistic colors for your dinosaur like gray brown and green or you can use fantasy colors like pink purple and blue 23 x research source for a nicer finish paint the dinosaur white first then let the paint dry this will give you a clean canvas to work on don t forget to add eyes and a mouth you can paint the eyes or glue googly eyes on instead how long it will take for the paint to dry will depend on what type of paint you re using plan to wait about 15 to 20 minutes however,Pets-and-Animals

elaborate you want the presentation of your finished turkey to be your turkey will be made of just three easy pieces one big bag for the body and the two smaller bags to serve as the drumsticks making a paper bag turkey only takes a few minutes from start to finish leaving you with plenty of time in your day to finish playing decorating or tackling other crafting projects form the body of the turkey take the large paper bag and fill it ¾ full with crumpled newspaper this will help fill out the body giving it a plump appearance and preventing it from collapsing once it s ready to be displayed after the bag has been stuffed fold the corners down diagonally and glue them in place tuck the folded tab down one more time and glue it to the underside of the turkey 1 x research source shape the body of the turkey by hand until it s smooth and round be sure to work out any square edges of creases from the original bag be careful not to tear the bag while sealing or shaping it shape the drumsticks grab the two smaller paper bags you ll be using these to craft the drumsticks of the turkey make one hand into a fist and stick it into each bag molding the opening of the bag around your wrist this will give the bag its recognizable drumstick shape remove your hand from the bag and fill the rounded end with newspaper twist the opening of each bag shut and secure it with a dab of glue 2 x research source like the body of the turkey the drumsticks will need to be filled in order to hold their shape cut the booties for the drumsticks your drumsticks aren t complete until they re dressed with a pair of frilly white booties like a traditional thanksgiving turkey cut your sheet of typing paper in half lengthwise then fold each piece in half again lengthwise use your scissors to make a series of cuts in the open edge of the paper to create a neat fringe try to make your cuts about ¼ inch apart your cuts only need to be about half the width of the paper put it all together wrap a paper bootie around the end of each drumstick and secure them with glue then place the drumsticks on either side of the sealed end of the turkey and glue them down that s it the result is a quirky lifelike baked bird that you might just mistake for the real thing 3 x research source attach the drumsticks to the tapered sides of the body where you folded down the edges of the big bag this will give the turkey a more realistic look the different parts of the turkey will have a little weight to them once they ve been filled use enough glue to make sure that everything holds put it on a platter arrange your paper bag turkey on a serving platter over a bed of parsley or tissue paper garnish surround the turkey with fallen leaves for a splash of vibrant color with the right details you ll have a mouthwatering craft turkey worthy of a fantasy feast to show off to your friends and family if you don t have a real serving platter lying around make your own out of cardboard construction paper and colored markers make sure to let everyone especially small children know that your paper turkey is not for eating add colorful designs before you fill the paper bags decorate the outsides for a more artistic funky finish use crayons markers washable paint stickers or glitter and customize your turkey with polka dots swirls or dazzling patterns using your favorite colors grab a friend sibling parent or child to decorate your turkey with then compare and display them together when you re done 4 x research source if you re using paint or a felt tip marker that might saturate the paper bags allow them to dry before stuffing or shaping them when making paper turkeys with your kids or students have them write down one thing they re thankful for somewhere on the big bag fill it with stuffing for an unexpected tasty twist ditch the newspaper and fill your turkey with popcorn candy or other easy to eat finger foods instead you can then have someone carve the turkey by cutting a flap in the top and have something to snack on until the main course is served this imaginative serving style is sure to be a hit at holiday parties 5 x research source popcorn makes a simple stuffing because it s light and takes up a lot of space but you could use just about any snack food like chips pretzels or chocolates to fill your turkey try filling the drumsticks separately with caramel corn to make dark meat 6 x research source put your paper bag turkey on display in addition to being a fun and easy project to do with your friends or loved ones your paper turkey will make a unique arrangement for the coffee table arts and crafts desk or kitchen counter it will look especially good surrounded by other festive fall decorations best of all you can store the playful papercraft away or simply make a new one the next time the holiday season rolls around 7 x research source a paper bag turkey will fit nicely with other homemade holiday decorations such as hand

how to make a painted paper butterfly,butterflies come in all sorts of shapes sizes and colors they are pretty to look at but they can be hard to catch luckily it s possible to make your own butterfly with paint and paper with a little bit of creativity and a few extra supplies you can come up with a truly unique butterfly,crease a sheet of white paper down the middle fold your paper in half widthwise or hamburger style then unfold it the crease down the middle will be your guide 1 x research source the paper needs to have a smooth texture so something like cardstock printer paper or even a plain paper plate will all work do not use construction paper it will soak up the paint the size of the paper does not matter although larger pieces are easier to work with choose 2 to 3 colors pf paint you can use acrylic craft paint tempera paint or poster paint make sure that these colors look nice together especially when mixed for example red yellow and orange are a great combination blue pink and purple is another combination that works well don t use opposite colors such as red and green or you will get brown you can use white as 1 of your colors this will give you a pastel look use glittery or metallic paint as 1 of your colors if you want to give your butterfly extra sparkle 2 x research source drop 2 to 3 blobs of paint using your first color you can squirt the paint directly from the bottle or you can drop the paint with a spoon instead 3 x research source place some of the blobs closer to the crease and others further from the crease don t put the paint too close to the edge of the paper or it will squirt out when you squish it 4 x research source add a few more blobs using your other colors make 2 to 3 blobs using the other colors keep the blobs close together if they are too far apart they won t blend together and create a butterfly don t use too much paint or the paper will get soggy if you are starting to see more paint than white paper stop fold your paper back in half then press on it don t pick up the paper simply fold the left side over onto the right just like closing a book press on the paper with your fingers to squish the paint around you may feel the paint moving through the paper which is fine 5 x research source unfold the paper and let the paint dry each time you do this project you will get a different shape and combinations of colors sometimes the shapes look like butterflies and sometimes they look like something else 6 x research source set the paper aside so that it can dry this can take as little as 15 minutes to as long as an hour if your butterfly doesn t look like a butterfly at all you can cut the paper into a butterfly shape click here to learn how to turn painted paper into a cut out butterfly 7 x research source add a body and antennae if desired paint the body black or glue a row of black pompoms down the middle instead use a thin paintbrush and black paint to add 2 antennae above the butterfly s head you can also draw the antenna on with glitter glue instead make your butterfly fancier by decorating the wings with glitter glue and or rhinestones glue 2 googly eyes to the head if you want a silly butterfly squirt 2 to 3 colors of paint onto a sheet of white paper you can use acrylic craft paint tempera paint or poster paint cardstock or printer paper will work the best but you can use a paper plate too don t use construction paper as it will soak the paint up too much 8 x research source spread the paint around to cover the entire paper you can do this with a paintbrush or a sponge brush make sure that the different colors of paint touch but don t mix them together too much or you will get a solid color you want a sort of tie dye effect 9 x research source if you run out of paint simply squirt more on you want to cover as much of the paper as possible let the paper dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes this should not take very long at all about 15 to 20 minutes if the paper is taking too long to dry you can speed the process up with a hair dryer or by setting the paper out in the sun fold the paper in half widthwise or hamburger style bring the narrow ends of the paper together then flatten the paper it does not matter if the paint is on the outside or on the inside draw half of a butterfly on the paper with the body along the fold you can make up your own butterfly shape or you can use a stencil template you can make 1 big butterfly or you can make several smaller butterflies if you are making more than 1 butterfly make sure that they are all on the fold 10 x research source cut the paper along the line that you drew if you drew on the painted side of the paper make sure that you cut just inside the lines this way they won t show up when you finish your butterfly unfold the butterfly and decorate it if desired you can leave your butterfly the way it is or you can decorate it further with paint glue and other items if you do decide to decorate your butterfly make sure that you let it dry before moving on here are some decorating ideas glue pompoms down the middle for the body you can also use black paint instead fold a pipe cleaner into a v then glue it behind the head for the antenna glue tiny googly eyes to the head to make a face you can also paint eyes on instead paint designs onto the wings with black or white paint or glitter glue glue gemstones to the wings to make them sparkle thread string through the butterfly so that you can hang it up use a needle to thread some string through the top of the butterfly tie the ends of the string together so that you can hang it if you made many small butterflies you can thread them onto a longer piece of string and use them as a garland instead paint a slotted wooden clothespin with black or brown acrylic paint use a paintbrush with synthetic bristles to apply black or brown acrylic craft paint to the clothespin then let the paint dry this should only take about 15 to 20 minutes 11 x research source if you can t find craft paint you can use tempera paint or poster paint instead slotted clothespins look like dolls they have a round head a narrow neck and 2 thin legs they do not open and close like regular clothespins if you don t have clothespins use a craft stick instead you only need to paint 1 side 12 x research source paint a piece of white paper 2 to 3 different watercolors choose 2 to 3 different colors of watercolor and apply them to the paper in blobs with a watercolor brush let the colors flow together to create a tie dye effect choose colors that look nice when mixed together such as blue pink and purple 13 x research source don t use contrasting colors such as red and green or you may get brown where they mix construction paper will work the best but you can use printer paper too watercolor brushes are soft and made from camelhair don t use stiff brushes because they don t pick up enough paint set the paper aside so that it can dry this can take a few hours so you can do something else in the meantime if you can t wait you can dry the paper with a hairdryer or leave it out in the hot sun for a bit how long the paint takes to dry depends on what type of paper you used how wet you made it and so forth fold the paper into a fan starting from the narrow end fold the narrow edge down by 1 2 inch 1 3 cm turn the paper over and fold the edge down by another 1 2 inch 1 3 cm keep doing this until you reach the other end of the paper 14 x research source you can make the folds smaller than 1 2 inch 1 3 cm but don t make them bigger if you used a craft stick fold the paper in half and cut out a butterfly shape instead place the body of the butterfly on the fold 15 x research source slide the fan into the clothespin hold the fan by the middle and turn it so that the edges open up like a bowtie pinch the middle of the fan and slide it up into the slot on the clothespin you ll get something that looks like if you get something that looks like the fan is turned the wrong way 16 x research source secure the fan inside the clothespin with glue hot glue will work the best but you can use thick tacky glue too if you used a craft stick glue the cut out butterfly to the back of the stick the painted side of the paper needs to be facing up with the stick down the middle 17 x research source glue some googly eyes onto the head of the clothespin place 2 tiny drops of tacky glue hot glue or white school glue onto the round part of the clothespin next press 2 tiny googly eyes into the glue then let the glue dry 18 x research source make sure that you are gluing the eyes to the front of the butterfly if you don t have googly eyes you can use tiny buttons or pompoms instead make sure that they are small enough to fit on the head part of the clothespin wrap a pipecleaner around the neck to make the antenna make a v shape with a pipe cleaner wrap it around the neck of the clothespin just below the round head twist the pipe cleaner once or twice so that it holds 19 x research source black will be the most realistic but you can use any color you want if you are using a craft stick fold the pipe cleaner in half to make a v then hot glue it to the back of the stick shape the antenna into a v then curl the ends open up the pipe cleaner to make a v cut the ends down if you think they are too long use your finger a pen or a pencil to curl the ends of the pipe cleaner into spirals 20 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper butterfly,paper butterflies are not only dainty and chic they re also fun to make try your hand at origami to create one or if you re more of a crafting beginner fold a simpler version with pretty pleats when you re finished use your butterflies as decor or give them to friends and family as gifts,fold the paper in half then open it and fold it in half the other way make sure to crease both of the folds line up the edges when you re folding to ensure the crease is directly in the center 1 x research source if your paper is the same color or pattern on both sides it doesn t matter which side you start on however if one side is white or the backside begin with that side facing up fold the paper in half diagonally open it and fold on the other diagonal bring 2 opposite corners together to create the folds press down firmly to create defined creases repeat on both diagonals open the paper to lie flat after you fold it 2 x research source your 4 folds should intersect in the exact center of the paper bring the right and left creases together creating a triangle with the paper laying flat in front of you press the right horizontal crease to the left one as you do this the paper should collapse onto itself in a triangle shape along the diagonal creases you made 3 x research source press down on the triangle to crease the paper once it s collapsed if the paper isn t folding properly go back over your original creases again if they aren t defined enough the paper will have trouble falling into the shape fold the 2 top corners into the center when you created the triangle shape it made 2 layers grab the corners on the top layer and line up their edges with the crease in the middle of the triangle 4 x research source try to align the corners with the crease perfectly so they aren t overlapping or so there isn t a large gap between the edges in the center flip the triangle over and fold the bottom up leaving a small tip showing you aren t folding it completely half instead you re folding it about 1 3 up from the base of the triangle hold the fold in place gently with your hand 5 x research source don t crease the fold bend the top layer of the tip over the base there are 2 layers at the tip of the triangle peel the top 1 forward folding it over the wide triangle bottom you re currently holding in place the tip will be the head of the butterfly 6 x research source crease the fold that you make with the tip this will help secure the body of the butterfly in place and prevent it from unraveling pull down the pieces from the bottom layer to create the lower wings with the top layer folded over bring the bottom layer of the tip in the opposite direction the points of the 2 triangular pieces should be facing down away from the folded head 7 x research source it may help to hold the folded tip with your thumb while you pull the other pieces down so that the butterfly doesn t come apart re crease the folded tip after you arrange the bottom pieces if necessary trim the edges of the wings if you want a smaller butterfly fold the square piece of paper in half creasing it line up the edges of the paper when you fold it to make sure you re creating a line directly down the middle press firmly with your fingernail to form the crease 8 x research source use any type of paper you d like whether it s origami paper colorful cardstock or even pretty gift wrap the size of your paper doesn t matter as long as it s square if you have a rectangular piece simply trim it down so all of the edges are the same length unfold the paper and cut along the crease line use your scissors to cut the piece of paper in half the groove of the crease should help guide your scissors in a straight line through the paper 9 x research source make sure your scissors are sharp so they don t tear or crinkle the paper if you have trouble cutting in a line hold your scissors against a straight edge like a ruler while you cut make accordion folds with one of the pieces of the paper fold a small piece lengthwise then flip the paper over to fold it back onto itself continue flipping the paper from side to side as you fold along the entire length of the paper think of this motion as similar to making a pleat or a fan 10 x research source you can make the folds as thick or as thin as you d like keep the folds all the same thickness no matter what size you choose take the other piece of paper you cut and fold it in half lengthwise place the 2 longer edges on top of each other then create a crease by pressing down along the fold 11 x research source try to make the crease as straight and even as possible so it splits the paper directly in half open it up and fold the 4 corners in toward the center crease line line up the edges straight along the crease your paper will now be in the shape of a hexagon with 2 pointed ends formed by the folded corners 12 x research source leave the corners folded if they won t stay in place use a piece of double sided tape or a little bit of glue under the flap flip the paper over and make accordion folds on each side of the crease fold one half the paper in towards the center then repeat on the other side this will be the top half of the butterfly s wings 13 x research source make the folds as large or as small as you d like depending on the size of your paper bend both pieces of pleated paper in half press the pleats together and hold the paper between your thumb and forefinger carefully fold one end onto the other creasing it firmly 14 x research source the paper won t stay folded but that s okay you just want to make a crease so the paper is in a v shape place 1 piece above the other and tie them together at the center arrange the 2 pieces so that they form a butterfly shape pinch them together while you tie string or cord around both pieces 15 x research source to secure the 2 pieces together better you can add a dab of craft glue or hot glue in the middle having a friend hold the pieces together while you tie the string makes it easier to get a tight knot you can also use ribbon or a pipe cleaner instead of string pull out the pleats to open up the wings scrunched up folds don t exactly resemble a beautiful butterfly gently pull the pleats apart so that the 2 pieces of paper look like 1 large wing on each side instead of 2 disjointed ones 16 x research source be careful not to rip the paper when you re arranging the pleats,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper peacock fan,have you ever made a paper fan simple wasn t it have you ever wondered how to make a plain paper fan look more creative and eye catching well you re in luck because this article will teach you how to make a paper fan that looks just like a real peacock,gather your supplies take your sheet of dark green paper and make one fold up about two centimetres wide turn the paper over to the other side and make another fold in the same way continue turning the paper over and making folds until you reach the end of the paper you should have an accordion like pleat of folds cut the paper in half along one of the folds fold one half of the paper in half along the width repeat with the other half take the inner ends of one half of the paper and glue them together do the same with the other half you should have two pleated semicircles staple the semicircles together to make one full circle now you have made a circular fan paint small red yellow and blue dots on your circular fan wait for the paint to dry glue the sequins on top of the dots of paint for some added sparkle cut out a peacock body shape from the blue cardstock paint the peacock s body all over with the blue glitter glue wait for it to dry glue the googly eye onto the peacock s body cut out a small triangle from the yellow cardstock and glue it onto the peacock s body this is the peacock s beak glue the green feathers onto the peacock s body these are its wings glue the popsicle stick between a fold on the circular fan glue the peacock s body onto the popsicle stick,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper dog,there are several fun ways to create a paper dog and luckily all of them require very few materials create a fun miniature dog that can stand on its own legs out of origami paper or make a folded dog face with a playful expression you could even make paper dog hand puppets to play with,select a piece of origami paper for your dog depending on what you have available choose either a 3 by 3 in 7 6 by 7 6 cm 6 by 6 in 15 by 15 cm or 10 by 10 in 25 by 25 cm piece of paper the bigger the sheet of paper the bigger your dog will be brown tan or white are common dog colors but don t hesitate to choose something more unconventional for your origami creation 1 x research source if you don t have origami paper use something else that is thin and easy to fold like newspaper magazine pages or even wrapping paper cut the substitute into the right dimensions so you have a perfectly square piece of paper fold the square of paper in half to create a triangle take the top left corner and fold it across so it meets the bottom right corner forming a triangle shape run your finger along the fold to create a crease 2 x research source use the back of your nail or something hard like the body of a pen to make your crease lines more defined open the square back up and fold it in half diagonally the other way unfold the paper so it is a square again make another triangle by folding the top right corner across to the bottom left corner press down along the fold line to make another crease 3 x research source it s really important in origami to have straight defined creases that is what enables your creation to stand upright once you ve finished unfold the square again and place it in front of you open up the piece of paper and set it in front of you make the bottom of the square parallel to your body 4 x research source there should be an x formed by the creases on the unfolded piece of paper bring the bottom left corner to the center point of the square and fold with the square unfolded in front of you take the bottom left corner and place its tip in the center of the square where the 2 creases intersect to create an x press the fold down to make a crease 5 x research source making firm creases will also keep the folded pieces of paper in place while you work on other sections otherwise you might risk things coming undone and losing your place in your project repeat the previous step to bring all the corners to the center one at a time take each remaining corner top left top right bottom right and fold them so their points are in the center of the square fold and press down the crease for each corner 6 x research source essentially this step turns the original square into a smaller square all the sides should still be equal to one another you will now have left top right and bottom sides with all points meeting in the middle of the square open the left flap fold it in half and then fold it back in place unfold the left hand side piece of paper fold the point in half so that the tip of it meets the intersection of your previous fold line then fold the entire left flap back into place 7 x research source there should be an open triangle when you look down at your square take the tip of the right flap and fold it back to overlap the edge line leave the flap folded to the center point take the tip of the corner that is in the center and fold it back about 2 3rds of the way make your crease so that the top forms a triangle that overhangs the outer edge of the square 8 x research source leave the top and bottom flaps in place and don t do anything to them at this point this fold will eventually become the dog s tail fold the entire square in half lengthwise pick up the piece of paper fold it in half evenly lengthwise to create the left and right sides of your origami dog when the fold is done set the paper down in front of you so that the pointy tail is pointing to the right 9 x research source take your time when lining up the center fold if the lines aren t straight your dog will be wobbly unfold the top flap and crease it from the top left to bottom right corner unfold the flap of paper from the top section of the dog so that its point is pointing toward your body then fold the entire section of paper up and create a diagonal fold that starts at the top left corner and finishes at the bottom right corner 10 x research source at this point in the folding process you re making the dog s head and legs refold the right edge along the crease line after making the diagonal fold take the point of the piece of paper you just folded up and bring it back down along the original crease line this creates the slant of the dog s leg 11 x research source the bottom edge should be in line with the ground if you were to pretend to stand it up repeat the previous 2 steps on the opposite side flip the piece of paper over unfold the flap of paper and make a diagonal fold from the top right corner to the bottom left corner then fold the paper back down along its original crease line to form the other leg 12 x research source even though you re nearing the end remember to take your time and make your folds as straight and defined as you can pull out the fold inside the dog s nose when you look at the piece of paper you should now see the dog s tail body triangle legs and triangle head look under the dog s nose and carefully pull out the fold this creates the dog s mouth and gives it a more realistic look 13 x research source the crease line creates a jawline for the dog draw a nose and eyes onto the dog to complete it take a marker and put an eye on each side of the dog as well as a nose for the nose just fill in the area around the front tip of the head you could also draw a little smile or any other embellishments you feel are appropriate 14 x research source once you get the hang of the pattern you can make an origami dog in just a few minutes choose a piece of origami paper for your project origami specific paper comes in squares which means it s ready to use and you don t need to cut it at all the larger the piece of paper you choose the bigger the dog head will be choose a color for your dog whether that is brown black white tan or an unconventional color like blue or green 15 x research source if you don t have origami paper cut a thin sheet of paper like newspaper or wrapping paper into a square fold the top left corner to the bottom right corner to make a triangle match up the 2 corners so that the sides are equal press the fold down firmly to create a crease 16 x research source to help crease the paper push the fold down with the back of your nail or with the body of a pen the stronger the crease the better definition your dog head will have bring the 2 bottom corners together to make a smaller triangle leave your first fold in place bring the bottom points together and make another fold to form a smaller triangle 17 x research source take your time when making your folds and line up the edges neatly unfold the triangle once and place it so the tip is pointing at your body undo the last fold you did so that just the large triangle is left position the paper so that the top of the triangle is pointing at you 18 x research source you ll use the center crease as a guide for your future folds make a diagonal fold on the right hand side starting at the center crease make a bigger fold for bigger dog ears or a smaller fold for smaller ears make the crease start at the center line and fold the right side corner down at a diagonal angle 19 x research source keep the fold lined up with the center crease to create a proportional face repeat the previous step on the opposite side try your best to create the same angle so that your dog s ears are the same size start the diagonal fold at the center crease line 20 x research source when you look down at your paper you should see a very angular looking dog head fold back the bottom and top points to create straight lines fold back the top tip of the dog s head just enough so that there is a flat line connecting the 2 ears fold the bottom tip back to create a jaw line for the dog 21 x research source if you need to use a little bit of glue or double sided tape to secure the points to the back of the dog s head draw the rest of the dog s features to complete your project use a black marker to draw eyes a nose and a mouth on the paper you can get as detailed as you want to but for basic features make circles for eyes and an upside down triangle for the nose for the mouth make a j attached to a backwards j coming out of the tip of the dog s nose 22 x research source you can get as creative as you d like with designing the dog s face try making spots on the ears or giving it whiskers or a tongue fold a piece of paper lengthwise into 3 equal sections use a piece of construction paper or computer paper or anything that comes close in size to 8 5 by 11 in 22 by 28 cm this piece of paper will be the dog s head so use whatever color you d like for that white works well but brown black or even an unconventional color like red would be fine 23 x research source avoid using really thin paper for this craft you ll be sticking your hands into the folds so it needs to be a little thicker to hold up glue the last fold down with your glue stick to help your craft stay together apply some glue to the back of the last fold press it down so it adheres to the other side 24 x research source glue sticks work great because they don t take long to dry if you don t have a glue stick try using double sided tape fold the paper in half so the seam is on the outside bring the short ends of the paper together making a crease in the middle fold the paper so that the side you just glued is facing up 25 x research source if you accidentally fold it the wrong way the first time that s okay just unfold it and reverse the direction fold the open edge to the bottom crease on each side on each side of the paper take the top edge and fold it back so it s in line with the bottom and make a crease after you ve done this on each side hold up the paper and check that it makes an m 26 x research source the top and bottom sections are where you ll place your fingers to make the puppet talk cut out the dog s ears and tongue and glue them into place use different colors of construction paper to cut out oblong shapes for the ears and tongue use your glue stick to attach them to the paper place the tongue inside the mouth and glue the ears on the top of the paper one on each side of the head 27 x research source for example if you used white paper for the dog s head use red paper for the tongue and black paper for the ears draw on the eyes and nose to complete your puppet use a black marker to draw circles for eyes and an upside down triangle for the nose you could even put 3 small dots on either side of the nose to make whiskers use your imagination and enjoy the decoration process 28 x research source to use the hand puppet simply put your thumb in the bottom flap and your fingers in the top flap when you open and close your hand the dog s mouth will open and close too,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper cat,paper is a great medium for a variety of projects if you love cats and want to create some of these whimsical creatures out of paper try making an origami cat which is simple and fun for another simple project cut a cat out of a paper plate if you have cardstock around enjoy making a kitty that stands up on its own,fold a square piece of paper in half to make triangles grab one corner and pull it diagonally across the square to the other corner lining them up on top of each other line up the edges too make a crease across the paper creating one triangle folded on top of another 1 x research source run your fingernail across the crease to make it sharper crease the triangle by folding it in half again and unfold it with the original fold at the top bring the top right corner over to meet the top left corner lining them up make sure the edges are aligned and then crease it down the middle you should now have a smaller triangle with a fold on the right 2 x research source once you ve run your fingernail along this crease open it up again to the original triangle you folded fold the 2 corners of the triangle down lift up the right corner of the triangle bring it over toward the middle when you make this fold the edge of the triangle will start at the middle point of the larger triangle on the long top side and run outward to one side of the bottom point the point will hang over the edge of the larger triangle make a crease along the top do the same on the other side 3 x research source bring the bottom point up about halfway grab the point at the bottom and make a fold about 1 4 of the way up the triangle that will leave the point about halfway up use your finger to make a crease across this fold 4 x research source at this point you should have a triangle on each side with the points hanging over the edge in the middle you ll have a large triangle with a smaller triangle inside it flip the paper over to see your cat and draw a face when you flip it over turn the paper so the pointed parts you folded over the edge are at the top making the ears draw on eyes a nose mouth and whiskers and your paper kitty is done 5 x research source flatten out and paint the plate use your fingers to stretch out the edge of the paper plate as much as possible paint the back side of the plate the color you want your cat to be black works well for a scary halloween cat 6 x research source you can use acrylic paint tempura paint or even finger paint apply it with a sponge brush sponge or large paintbrush trace and cut out a large circle on one edge of the plate use a food container top or another large circle you have the circle should take up about 50 of the larger circle trace it close to one edge on the non painted side then cut out the circle and that edge together 7 x research source you can also use a compass to trace the circle you want the larger circle to end up looking like a crescent moon with pointed ends outline a smaller circle on the head piece for cutting out the head tail and ears the head piece is the smaller circle you snipped out of the original plate using a container lid trace a smaller circle onto the back of this piece in the smooth part of the plate and snip around it leave the wrinkled edge for the tail from the strip you have left cut out 2 small triangles for ears and a curved piece for the tail 8 x research source tape the head and tail on the crescent flip the crescent shape so the points are downward forming the legs turn it to the non painted side tape or glue the smaller circle on one side of the arch near the top place it slightly behind the big circle arrange the tail arching away from the crescent on the other end and tape or glue it into place 9 x research source the painted sides should all be facing front glue or tape the ears eyes nose and whiskers on the cat s face glue the ears you cut out on the back of the cat s head with the painted side facing forward cut out small strips for the whiskers and glue them into place for the eyes and nose you can cut out pieces of paper in other colors or use googly eyes and a pompom for the nose 10 x research source for a cat nose cut a little triangle out of pink paper for eyes cut eye shapes then draw in slits in the middle slice a piece of 11 by 8 5 inches 28 by 22 cm cardstock in half create 2 rectangles each one will be 5 5 by 8 5 inches 14 by 22 cm you ll use one half for the body of the cat and one half for the head and tail 11 x research source this can be any color you want try black for halloween or a white cat for winter start the body by folding 1 piece of the cardstock in half find the middle of the long edge on one of the smaller pieces of cardstock you just cut fold it over to make this long edge half the size make sure the edges meet 12 x research source for another type of body cut out a wide triangle with a curved edge pull the sides of the triangle together to overlap making a cone glue the edges together you can cut out small strips of paper for feet at the bottom 13 x research source finish the body by cutting out a half circle on the folded rectangle find the new long edge that s not the folded edge come in about 1 inch 2 5 cm on this edge and cut a half circle that reaches to about 1 inch 2 5 cm from the other side 14 x research source this makes the body and the legs the top of the half circle is the body and the parts that come down are the legs unfold the rectangle slightly to make an a shape on the bottom of each leg bend out a small square that s about 0 25 inches 0 64 cm long fold it at a 90 degree angle to make feet glue the body onto a small piece of cardstock use a half sheet of cardstock though pick a different color from the cat add glue to the bottom of the cat s feet and press them onto the cardstock as you glue the body make an a shape with it using the feet as the bottom of the a hold the feet in place for a few seconds until the glue starts to set 15 x research source if you used the cone shaped body you don t need to glue it to anything as it is sturdy enough as it is slice a tail off of the second piece of cardstock you cut in the beginning cut about 1 inch 2 5 cm of cardstock off one of the short ends leaving a rectangle that s about 7 5 by 5 5 inches 19 by 14 cm cut off the corners of the strip so that the tail is pointed at both of the short ends 16 x research source you could cut out a curvy tail instead if you prefer 17 x research source cut the head out of the rest of the second piece of cardstock fold the piece of paper so that you half the long side on the long non folded edge make the cat s chin by curving the corners with scissors unfold the rectangle for a moment and start cutting halfway up the bottom rectangle as you do angle the cut in about 1 inch 2 5 cm and stop at the crease in the middle fold the rectangle back and the cuts you just made will pop up for the ears 18 x research source run your fingernail along the crease at the top to make sure the cat s face stays folded create the eyes and whiskers by cutting them out of paper for the eyes cut out 2 eye shapes from a contrasting color yellow goes well with black draw in a slit on each eye with a marker using the scraps of paper from your cat s main color cut out small strips of paper for the whiskers glue the eyes and whiskers in place on the cat s face 19 x research source add the tail and face to the cat s body by cutting slots for them to slide into along the top of the fold on the cat s body cut a small slit going downward on either end of the body about 1 inch 2 5 cm from the ends slide the back rectangle of the cat s face into one end facing away from the body slide one end of the tail into the back slit 20 x research source add a bit of glue if they don t want to stay in place,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper snake,paper snakes are fun and easy to make they are a great craft to learn about snakes they also make great decorations for halloween or for nature lovers this article will show you a few simple and fun ways of making a snake out of paper,gather your supplies this is a simple snake that you can make out of a paper plate it lays flat on your table but springs up into a long snake when you hang it here s a list of what you will need paper plate acrylic or tempera paint paintbrushes spongers etc pencil or pen scissors crayons markers or googly eyes red paper or ribbon white school glue or tacky glue string thumbtack hole punch optional rhinestones glitter etc optional cut off the raised edge of a paper plate be sure not to go too far into the middle or else it may not be big enough if you don t have a paper plate use a small plate to trace a circle onto a large sheet of paper cut the circle out using a pair of scissors and use that circle instead paint or decorate the paper plate you can paint the snake however you want you can use a paintbrush a sponge or even your fingers snakes come in many different colors and patterns here are some ideas to get you started paint the plate a solid color and let the paint dry next dip a sponge into a different color and tap the excess paint off onto a paper towel then dab the sponge all over the plate if you want to add another color wait for the first one to dry this will give you a scale like effect 1 x research source wrap a sheet of bubble wrap bubble side out around a rolling pin and secure it with tape pour two colors of paint onto a palette and gently roll the pin across next roll the pin across the plate you will get a scale effect 2 x research source you can also color the other side of the plate to make the snake s belly most snakes have a plain light colored belly do this once the top of the snake dries 3 x research source draw a spiral on the back of the plate make the spiral about half an inch thick it doesn t have to be perfect but try to make it even all the way around the center of the spiral will be the snake s head so make it rounded you are drawing the spiral on the back so that you won t see it on the top cut out the spiral shape start front the outside of the spiral and work your way in try to do this right on the line because you don t want the line to show on the finished product add more decorations to the snake at this point you can paint on some extra designs to make your snake even more special here are some ideas to get you started paint thick stripes across the spiral to make a striped snake paint xs or diamond shapes across the spiral to make a diamond pattern glue some colorful rhinestones using white school glue or tacky glue 4 x research source try not to add too many or your snake will be too heavy make some squiggles and patterns on the snake using white glue then shake some glitter onto the glue tap off the excess glitter and let the glue dry add the eyes onto the front of the head you can draw the eyes on using a marker or crayons you can also paint the eyes on if you have googly eyes at home you can glue them on using white school glue or tacky glue remember the head is the rounded part in the middle of the spiral add the tongue cut a thin 1 to 2 inch 2 54 to 5 08 long rectangle out of red paper you can also use a piece of thin red ribbon cut a v shape into one end of the rectangle this will be the snake s forked tongue lift the head up and glue the tongue under it punch a hole through the snake if you want to hang it you can punch the hole at the end of the tail right between the eyes or even in the tongue thread a piece of string through the hole and tie it in a knot use the other end of the string to hang the snake from a door knob a stick or even a thumbtack in the wall gather your supplies you can easily make a snake out of construction paper rings the more rings you add the longer your snake will be here s a list of what you will need to make such a snake several sheets of construction paper red paper scissors glue stick tape or stapler white school glue or tacky glue markers crayons or googly eyes find some construction paper you will need at least three pieces you can use all one color to make a solid colored snake you can also use different colors if you want a striped snake cut the paper into 1½ to 2 inch 3 81 to 5 08 centimeters thick strips you will need at least 16 strips the more you make the longer your snake will be 5 x research source consider stacking the paper and cutting several sheets at the same time this will make the cutting part faster make a ring out of a strip of paper and glue it shut pick up a strip of paper and bring the two ends together overlap them by about 1 inch 2 54 centimeters use a glue stick to hold them together you can also use tape or a stapler instead do not use white school glue or tacky glue it does not dry fast enough your snake will fall apart before the glue dries if you are using a stapler ask an adult to help you slip a strip of paper through the ring and glue the ends together 6 x research source keep repeating this step until you run out of strips of paper you can make your snake just one color or you can make it many colors you can give your snake a pattern or make the colors random add the tongue cut a skinny rectangle from red paper and cut a v shape into one end to make the fork fold the flat side over by about ½ inch 1 27 centimeters to make a tab glue the tab to one of the end rings add the eyes right above the tongue you can draw them on using a marker or crayon you can also glue them on using some white school glue or tacky glue gather your supplies if you have any spare toilet paper rolls laying around you can turn them into a fun wiggly snake using a bit of paint and string here s a list of what you will need 3 4 toilet paper rolls acrylic or tempera paint paintbrushes scissors yarn red paper or ribbon white school glue or tacky glue markers crayons or googly eyes hole punch gather three to four toilet paper rolls if you cannot find that many toilet paper rolls you can use some paper towel rolls instead use scissors to cut each toilet paper roll in half if you are using paper towel rolls cut them into thirds paint the toilet paper rolls and let them dry you can paint them all one color you can also paint each roll a different color if you want to add patterns and designs wait for the paint to dry first choose two rolls to be your head and tail tip and set them aside you don t want them to get mixed up with the body of the snake punch four holes in each body piece there will be two holes on the top and two holes on the bottom the holes need to be straight across from each other make sure that the top and bottom holes on each side are aligned punch two holes into the head and tail tip piece the holes need to be straight across from each other cut some yarn into 5 inch 12 7 centimeters long pieces 7 x research source you will need enough pieces to tie the rolls together tie the pieces together using the yarn don t tie the yarn too tight or the snake won t be able to wiggle there should be a gap between each piece try to hide the knot inside the snake add the tongue cut a long skinny rectangle from a piece of red paper and cut a v shape into on end you can also use a piece of red ribbon glue the flat end inside the snake s head make sure that it is in the middle of the mouth if you want your snake to have a closed mouth ask an adult to staple the end of the roll shut right over the tongue add the eyes you can draw the eyes on using a crayon or marker you can also paint them on if you have any googly eyes at home you can glue them on using white school glue or tacky glue,Pets-and-Animals
how to make goldfish paper lanterns,goldfish are a classic fish and very popular when it comes to decorating a party or room with an underwater theme instead of using paper cutouts of goldfish why not make 3d goldfish out of paper lanterns they are lightweight colorful and very easy to make you can make a simple goldfish by adding some eyes and fins out of construction paper or you can get fancier with tissue paper instead,get a solid colored paper lantern and open it up most goldfish are orange but yours can be any color you want draw a tail fin shape onto a sheet of construction paper then cut it out with a pair of scissors make the base of the tail straight so that you can attach it to the lantern be sure to draw the tail ½ to 1 inch 1 27 to 2 54 centimeters longer than you want it to be choose a color that closely matches the color of your lantern make the base of the tail fold the base of the tail down by ½ to 1 inch 1 25 to 2 54 centimeters to make a flap cut a slit into the middle of the flap all the way down to the folded edge to create two flaps leave one of the flaps the way it is and fold the other one to the back of the fin you will now have two flaps with each one pointing in a different direction this will not only allow the tail to flap about but also make it easier to glue on 1 x research source attach the fin to the lantern turn the lantern so that one of the holes is facing up use a hot glue gun or double sided tape to attach the tail to the side of the lantern draw two side fin shapes then cut them out to make the fins even stack two sheets of construction paper one on top of the other first draw your fin shape then cut it out you don t need to make the base of the fins flat or straight attach the fins to the side of the lantern find the middle of the lantern then attach the bottom tip of the fin with a drop of glue or a small piece of double sided tape repeat this step for the other side of the fish with the other fin don t glue the entire fin down you want it to stick out cut two circles out of white construction paper and two circles out of black construction paper to make the eyes make sure that the black circles are smaller you can also use printer paper and cardstock for this another alternative would be to use large googly eyes make sure that they are proportionate to your fish 2 x research source attach the eyes to the fish position them in front of the side fins and just above them you can attach them using double sided tape or a hot glue gun if you are using googly eyes however a hot glue might be the better option thread some string through the top of the fish so that you can hang it thread a piece of string through the bar in the top hole of your lantern then tie it into a loop if your lantern doesn t have a bar poke two small holes in the top of the lantern just below the ring opening hang the loop from a hook wherever you want these lanterns make great decorations for underwater themed parties and rooms be careful not to get them wet however get a solid colored paper lantern and open it up the smaller your lantern is the easier it will be to work with look for something that is about 12 inches 30 48 centimeters in diameter most goldfish are orange but you can make your goldfish any color you want trace a circle that is the same size as the smaller opening on your lantern onto a sheet of tissue paper choose a different color than your lantern it can be lighter darker or even a contrasting color make the circle as even as you can if possible use a pencil to trace around to smaller opening of the lantern if both of the openings are the same size simply choose one of them trace a larger circle around the first circle how much space you leave between the two circles depends on the size of you lantern the bigger your lantern is the more space you will need start with ½ inch 1 27 centimeters and go from there cut the circles out then save the ring discard the inner circle or save it for another project use a glue stick to glue the ring onto the smaller opening this will create an open mouth for the goldfish if you have any excess tissue paper hanging over the opening you can trim it off with a pair of scissors or fold it into the lantern and secure it with more glue 3 x research source cut two circles out of white tissue paper and two smaller circles out of black cardstock or construction paper if you don t have any white tissue paper you can use white printer paper instead glue the black circles onto the white circles then the white circles onto the lantern glue the white circles above the mouth and slightly to the side cut out two top fin shapes out of tissue paper stack two sheets of tissue paper then cut a fin shape out this way you will end up with two matching fins use a color that matches your lantern most top fins will be long and somewhat skinny make sure that yours is at least 2 inches 5 08 centimeters tall glue them together except for the bottom ½ to 1 inch 1 27 to 2 54 centimeters use a pair of scissors to trim of any overhanging tissue paper the double tissue paper layer will help the top fin stand up 4 x research source fold the loose ends of the fin down to create two flaps then attach it to the fish place a strip of double sided tape to each flap then place the fin on top of the fish run your finger across the top of each flap to seal the tape cut out two side fins out of matching tissue paper then attach them to the sides of the fish you can use a glue stick or double sides tape for this make sure that you are only gluing the bottom edge so that the fins can flap around you don t have to create double layers for these or fold any flaps the side fins can be as long and flowing as you d like cut out two tail shapes out of matching tissue paper stack two sheets of tissue paper then cut a tail fin out you will end up with two identical shapes you will be fitting the tail over the back hole on your lantern so be sure to add ½ of the hole s width plus an additional ½ to 1 inch 1 27 to 2 54 centimeters glue them together except for the bottom few inches how much you leave unglued depends on the excess amount you added once again use a pair of scissors to trim off any overhanging pieces of tissue paper 5 x research source fold the loose ends out to create flaps then attach them to the back of the fish position the tail over the back opening fold the excess tissue paper over the edges of the opening then glue or tape them down onto the body of the fish 6 x research source use a needle to thread clear string through the top of the fish be sure to go under one of the metal ribs to prevent the tissue paper from tearing tie the string into a loop then hang your fish this fish makes a great decoration for parties or underwater themed rooms be careful not to get it wet however,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper dinosaur,with the right supplies and a bit of time you can make your very own paper dinosaur that stands or moves if you d like a bigger craft project you could even attempt a paper mache dinosaur or an origami dinosaur depending on the colors that you use you can make your dinosaur look realistic or cartoonish,glue a sheet of green construction paper to a piece of thin cardboard this will make your dinosaur nice and sturdy if you don t have any green construction paper paint the cardboard with green acrylics or poster paint let the glue or paint dry before moving on 1 x research source the thin cardboard from cereal and snack boxes works great for this if you don t have thin cardboard or construction paper try green cardstock instead you can also use poster paper but you ll need to paint it draw and cut the body head tail and leg shapes from the paper look up coloring book or cartoon pictures of long necked dinosaurs then break it down into separate body parts draw these separately with a pen or pencil then cut them out here are the basic shapes you ll need 2 x research source a long stem with an oval shaped head like a brontosaurus or apatosaurus a long tapering tail like a skinny triangle 2 rectangular legs a mound or lump shaped body like a semicircle but with rounded bottom corners make spikes for the dino s back using paper and cardboard if desired glue the paper to the cardboard first or paint the cardboard let the paint or glue dry then draw 4 to 5 triangular spikes cut them out then set them aside 3 x research source use a different color of paint or paper for this orange is a great choice but a lighter or darker shade of green will also work you can also make smaller rectangles for nails use a pen to poke a hole in the ends of each limb make the holes 1 4 to 1 2 in 0 64 to 1 27 cm away from the center of each edge a pen or pencil will work just fine for a cardstock dino but if you used thin cardboard use a nail to make the holes instead 4 x research source you ll need holes in the following areas base of the neck base of the tail and the top of each leg don t use a hole punch the hole will be too big and the brad will fall through if you re a child ask an adult to help you with this step especially if you re using a nail poke 4 holes in the body so that you can secure the limbs make 2 holes along the wider flatter bottom edge of the body poke another set of holes on the sides of the body for the tail and legs as with the limbs make the holes 1 4 to 1 2 in 0 64 to 1 27 cm from the edges 5 x research source don t poke the neck and tail holes too close to the top make them closer to the bottom so that your dinosaur has a humped back don t place the legs too close together keep them closer to the bottom corners of the body use brads to secure the limbs behind the dinosaur s body stick a brad through the front of the neck hole on the body slide the neck piece onto the back of the prong behind the body pry open the back of the brad then press the prongs flat against the back of the dinosaur 6 x research source repeat this step for the tail and both legs always add the limbs to the back of the body not the front make sure that the limbs are facing up as well otherwise your dinosaur won t match brad prongs can hurt if they get under your nail consider using a butter knife to pry them apart glue the spikes to the back of the dinosaur flip the dinosaur over so that you can see the back draw a line of glue along its back then add the triangular spikes make sure that the flat bases are touching the dinosaur s back while the pointy tips are sticking out 7 x research source if you made nails for the dino glue them to the bottom of each leg white school glue and glue sticks will work just fine for this hot glue is not recommended because it s too bulky give the dinosaur a face here is where you can get a little creative for a simple dinosaur use a black marker to draw an eye and mouth for a fancier dinosaur use hot glue or white school glue to attach a googly eye to the dinosaur s face 8 x research source give your dinosaur more character by adding eyebrows or eyelashes fold and cut a plain white paper plate in half with scissors fold the plate in half first then use the crease as a cutting guide for best results use the kind that s made from cardstock and has a frilled edge rather than the kind that s made from thick cardboard with a rim 9 x research source set aside 1 of the paper plate halves this will make the body cut a dino head tail and spikes from the other paper plate half draw the shapes on the second paper plate half the other one will be the body then cut them out make sure that the limbs are proportionate to the body don t worry about the feet you will be using toilet paper rolls for that 10 x research source make the spikes about 1 in 2 5 cm tall and wide make the tail about 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm wide at the base and about 1 2 to 2 3 the length of the paper plate if you don t know how to draw a dinosaur head tail or spikes look at pictures of cartoon dinosaurs online or in coloring books use the brim to make the neck if desired cut it off first so that you get a c shape then cut it in half use 1 of these halves to make the neck glue the cut shapes to the other paper plate half the straight edge of the plate is the bottom of the dinosaur while the curved side is the back glue the tail to 1 end and the neck and or head to the other if you made spikes glue them down the dinosaur s back 11 x research source use scissors to cut an empty toilet paper roll into thirds keep 2 of the segments and discard the third this will give you rings that are a little over 1 in 2 5 cm tall if you don t have any empty toilet paper rolls you can use an empty paper towel roll instead 12 x research source if you re using an empty paper towel roll cut 2 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm segments from it cut a set of slits into the top of each toilet paper ring you will be sliding the dinosaur s body into these slits so make sure that they are directly across from each other the easiest way to do this would be to squish the rings in half then cut a 1 2 in 1 3 cm long slit into each one 13 x research source slide the dinosaur into the slits take the first roll and turn it so that 1 slit is facing the dinosaur s head and the other is facing its tail slide the bottom edge of the dinosaur s body into the slit repeat this process for the other leg 14 x research source slide the legs apart until they are on opposite sides of the plate paint the dinosaur then let it dry acrylic craft paints will work great for this but you can also use poster paint too use the same colors and patterns for both the front and back how long it will take for the paint to dry depends on what you are using expect to wait about 15 to 20 minutes however 15 x research source you can take the dinosaur s body off of its feet in order to paint it do the front first let it dry then do the back don t forget to paint the eyes and mouth alternatively you can glue on some googly eyes after the paint has dried blow up a balloon tear newspaper into strips and make a papier mâché paste blow up a balloon to your desired size next tear some newspaper into narrow strips about 1 by 3 in 2 5 by 7 6 cm lastly prepare your preferred papier mâché glue or paste 16 x research source the most popular papier mâché paste is just 1 part water and 1 part pva glue white school glue start with just 1 or 2 sheets of newspaper you can always make more strips don t cut the strips or the edges will be too sharp and create creases tearing them will give you a smoother finish dip the strips into the paste then apply them to the balloon run each strip of newspaper between your fingers after dipping it in the paste this will remove any excess glue make sure that the strips are all going in the same direction as you apply them 17 x research source overlap the strips a little such as by 1 4 to 1 2 in 0 64 to 1 27 cm keep the balloon in a cup or bowl so that it doesn t roll around you may have to let 1 side of the balloon dry first before doing the other leave a coin sized space at one end of the balloon exposed so that you can pop the balloon later apply 2 more layers of papier mâché you probably don t need to use the glue for the second layer the wet strips already adhered to the balloon should be enough for the new ones to stick to if the balloon starts to get too soggy however let it dry a bit then continue working consider using white tissue paper for as a fourth and final layer this will give you a smoother base and help the paint show up better if you choose to use tissue paper then make sure that you tear it into 3 by 1 in 7 6 by 2 5 cm strips as well let the strips dry overnight then pop and remove the balloon you may have to wait even longer than that depending on how dry or humid it is in your home in fact it would be a good idea to poke your finger under the papier mâché if it feels wet give it a little more time 18 x research source this completes your dinosaur s body don t worry about the hole left by the balloon you ll end up covering it with the dinosaur s head or tail tape paper towel roll segments to the balloon for legs turn the papier mâché balloon on its side then use masking tape to secure the legs to the bottom 19 x research source don t use clear tape it won t stick to the papier mâché you can also just cut 2 empty toilet paper rolls in half and use those instead use cardboard paper towel tubes and foil to make the other limbs scrunch up aluminum foil into a ball to make a head and then use aluminum foil shaped into a cone for the tail the size and shape for each depends on what type of dinosaur that you re making so look at some reference pictures here are some more ideas to get you started 20 x research source triceratops cut a round scalloped shape out of cardboard for the fan use foil to make the horns stegosaurus cut triangles out of cardboard for the fins apatosaurus brontosaurus use a paper towel tube to make the neck tape the pieces to the body with masking tape take 1 of your pieces and hold it against the balloon where you want it to go secure it with strips of masking tape until the seam is completely hidden again don t use clear tape because it won t hold triceratops tape the fan to the balloon first then add the head you may have to use hot glue to secure it finish by sticking the horns to the head stegosaurus tape or hot glue the head to 1 side of the body and the tail to the other use strips of tape to add the fins down the back and tail apatosaurus brontosaurus tape the head to the long neck first then tape the head to the body add the tail to the other side of the body cover the pieces and the seams with more papier mâché start by applying strips of papier mâché to the seams after that cover the shapes themselves if the pieces feel unstable add more papier mâché to the seams 21 x research source you may have to tear more strips of newspaper and prepare more papier mâché paste for this consider making some smaller strips for sharp curves and tight corners if the hole from when you removed the balloon is still visible cover it up with more papier mâché wait for everything to dry how long it will take for your project to dry really depends on what the weather is like papier mâché will dry a lot faster on a hot dry sunny day than on a cold wet day be patient 22 x research source paint the dinosaur as desired then let the paint dry acrylic craft paint will work just fine for this but you can use poster paint too you can use realistic colors for your dinosaur like gray brown and green or you can use fantasy colors like pink purple and blue 23 x research source for a nicer finish paint the dinosaur white first then let the paint dry this will give you a clean canvas to work on don t forget to add eyes and a mouth you can paint the eyes or glue googly eyes on instead how long it will take for the paint to dry will depend on what type of paint you re using plan to wait about 15 to 20 minutes however,Pets-and-Animals

how to make a paper bag turkey,looking for a fun way to celebrate this holiday season whether you re crafting homemade decorations for thanksgiving dinner or just want to get into the spirit of autumn making a turkey from ordinary paper bags is a quick simple and creative activity that is sure to please children and adults alike this project only requires a few simple materials and will add a bit of thrifty fall flair wherever it s displayed,gather your materials for this project you ll need only need a handful of basic items 3 brown paper bags 1 large paper grocery bag and 2 smaller standard paper bags 1 sheet of white 8 ½ x 11 typing paper a few sheets of newspaper a pair of scissors and a hot glue gun or some craft glue any additional materials will be up to you depending on how elaborate you want the presentation of your finished turkey to be your turkey will be made of just three easy pieces one big bag for the body and the two smaller bags to serve as the drumsticks making a paper bag turkey only takes a few minutes from start to finish leaving you with plenty of time in your day to finish playing decorating or tackling other crafting projects form the body of the turkey take the large paper bag and fill it ¾ full with crumpled newspaper this will help fill out the body giving it a plump appearance and preventing it from collapsing once it s ready to be displayed after the bag has been stuffed fold the corners down diagonally and glue them in place tuck the folded tab down one more time and glue it to the underside of the turkey 1 x research source shape the body of the turkey by hand until it s smooth and round be sure to work out any square edges of creases from the original bag be careful not to tear the bag while sealing or shaping it shape the drumsticks grab the two smaller paper bags you ll be using these to craft the drumsticks of the turkey make one hand into a fist and stick it into each bag molding the opening of the bag around your wrist this will give the bag its recognizable drumstick shape remove your hand from the bag and fill the rounded end with newspaper twist the opening of each bag shut and secure it with a dab of glue 2 x research source like the body of the turkey the drumsticks will need to be filled in order to hold their shape cut the booties for the drumsticks your drumsticks aren t complete until they re dressed with a pair of frilly white booties like a traditional thanksgiving turkey cut your sheet of typing paper in half lengthwise then fold each piece in half again lengthwise use your scissors to make a series of cuts in the open edge of the paper to create a neat fringe try to make your cuts about ¼ inch apart your cuts only need to be about half the width of the paper put it all together wrap a paper bootie around the end of each drumstick and secure them with glue then place the drumsticks on either side of the sealed end of the turkey and glue them down that s it the result is a quirky lifelike baked bird that you might just mistake for the real thing 3 x research source attach the drumsticks to the tapered sides of the body where you folded down the edges of the big bag this will give the turkey a more realistic look the different parts of the turkey will have a little weight to them once they ve been filled use enough glue to make sure that everything holds put it on a platter arrange your paper bag turkey on a serving platter over a bed of parsley or tissue paper garnish surround the turkey with fallen leaves for a splash of vibrant color with the right details you ll have a mouthwatering craft turkey worthy of a fantasy feast to show off to your friends and family if you don t have a real serving platter lying around make your own out of cardboard construction paper and colored markers make sure to let everyone especially small children know that your paper turkey is not for eating add colorful designs before you fill the paper bags decorate the outsides for a more artistic funky finish use crayons markers washable paint stickers or glitter and customize your turkey with polka dots swirls or dazzling patterns using your favorite colors grab a friend sibling parent or child to decorate your turkey with then compare and display them together when you re done 4 x research source if you re using paint or a felt tip marker that might saturate the paper bags allow them to dry before stuffing or shaping them when making paper turkeys with your kids or students have them write down one thing they re thankful for somewhere on the big bag fill it with stuffing for an unexpected tasty twist ditch the newspaper and fill your turkey with popcorn candy or other easy to eat finger foods instead you can then have someone carve the turkey by cutting a flap in the top and have something to snack on until the main course is served this imaginative serving style is sure to be a hit at holiday parties 5 x research source popcorn makes a simple stuffing because it s light and takes up a lot of space but you could use just about any snack food like chips pretzels or chocolates to fill your turkey try filling the drumsticks separately with caramel corn to make dark meat 6 x research source put your paper bag turkey on display in addition to being a fun and easy project to do with your friends or loved ones your paper turkey will make a unique arrangement for the coffee table arts and crafts desk or kitchen counter it will look especially good surrounded by other festive fall decorations best of all you can store the playful papercraft away or simply make a new one the next time the holiday season rolls around 7 x research source a paper bag turkey will fit nicely with other homemade holiday decorations such as hand turkey cutouts popsicle stick snowflakes and construction paper pumpkins,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper penguin,whether as a crafts project for a small child or as an origami project for older people there are plenty of ways to make a paper penguin that are fun for people of any age,purchase origami paper this method calls for just a single sheet of 6 x 6 origami paper if you want a larger penguin then you can easily go for 12 x 12 paper but you ll have to multiply any directions containing measurements by two if you want an even better looking penguin buy paper that is white on one side and black on the other 1 x research source fold diagonal creases along the middle to start you want to place the sheet of origami paper flat with the white side facing up if you have paper with a black side as well then fold the paper in half diagonally so the bottom left corner is flush with the top right corner and make a crease unfold the paper and do the same with the opposite corners and then unfold the page again 2 x research source when you unfold the sheet again you will have creases forming a large x across the page 3 x research source fold the lower left corner to the center with the page flat again and the large creases making an x you will then take the lower left corner of the paper and fold it so that the tip of the corner touches the center of the page in other words the corner edge will touch the center of the x made by the earlier creases 4 x research source flatten the folded portion and make another crease then open the sheet so it s flat again fold the upper right corner to the crease you just made you will now have the large x crease as well as a smaller diagonal crease in the lower left of the page take the top right corner of the page and fold it over so that it touches the lower left crease 5 x research source then open the page once more turn the page over for the next set of folds you ll need to turn the page over if you have two colored paper this means that the black side will now faces up when you turn the paper over orient it diagonally so that the current lower left corner now points up 6 x research source fold the left corner to the right corner with the paper in the new orientation take the corner pointing left and fold the paper in half so that it s flush with the corner pointing right 7 x research source there will already be a crease here from when you made this fold on the other side of the sheet but you ll need to crease it in the opposite direction when you fold it over fold the bottom corner over to the right from the last step the sheet will now look like a triangle with the side on the left forming a vertical line take the corner of the triangle that points down and fold it across at a 45 angle 8 x research source fold it so that the horizontal edge made at the top of the fold touches the lower crease already on this part of the page not the middle crease but the one below it 9 x research source once you ve made the crease from this fold turn the flap back over so that you have the same triangle shape you started with reverse fold the corner along the crease you just made a reverse fold is a bit more three dimensional than the other folds you ve made so far in order to make the reverse fold take the crease you just made and crease it in the opposite direction but make the crease by folding and tucking the corner into the paper 10 x research source since reverse folds can be hard to visualize as written instructions you can find the exact fold in question here https www youtube com watch v ihqmzluqmmg t 80 fold the top half over with the reverse fold out of the way you want to take the corner pointing right just the top layer not both layers and fold it back on itself fold it so that the flat side just above the corner lines up flush with the flat vertical line on the left side of the paper 11 x research source make a crease here but do not unfold the flap leave it folded turn the page over and make the same fold on the other side you now want to turn the paper over completely and make the same fold you just made but from the other side in other words fold the other corner the bottom layer from the previous step over so that its upper edge is also flush with the same flat side of the page 12 x research source especially if you re using a two colored sheet of paper this step will make more sense because the form of the penguin will start to become more apparent as the black side of the page will face outward on both sides as the project continues to take shape these will be the wings turn the paper over again to prepare for the next major fold you will need to turn the whole paper over again when you do you want to orient the paper so that the really narrow point is pointing upward 13 x research source fold the narrow point over to the left with the paper oriented so that the long narrow point face up take that point and fold it over at a 45 angle so that the point now points to the left 14 x research source you ll see how this fold starts to take shape as the penguin s beak after making the crease in this fold return the point to the upward position reverse fold along the crease you just made this step requires you to make an outside reverse fold along the crease you made in the last step an outside reverse fold is slightly different from the earlier reverse fold to make the fold unfold the paper along the black side slightly and poke your finger from the white side at the fold you made in the last step when the creases reverse direction simply reform the fold so that the two black sides of the sheet are in contact again 15 x research source once again reverse folds can be a bit difficult to describe you can find the exact movement at https www youtube com watch v ihqmzluqmmg t 127 fold the wing over though clearly visible now the wings won t quite look perfect yet take the wing on the side facing up and fold it over so that the white side faces out you ll fold it back so that the corner which was facing the bottom left now points to the right pull it back far enough so that it s just shy of where the little tail is at the bottom of the paper 16 x research source fold the wing back over on itself once you ve made the crease from the previous step fold the wing back over on itself so that the black side is once again facing up fold it so that the tip of the corner is just shy of touching the horizontal white edge at the bottom of the body 17 x research source makes a rabbit s ear fold to make the rabbit s ear fold lift the portion of the wing you just folder and reverse the crease from the last step but only at the bottom of the crease and only at the depth of roughly the tip of your finger this will makes the bottom tip of the wing into a little flap though the flat edge will still be parallel to the rest of the wing 18 x research source as with the other complex folds a visual can help which you will find here https www youtube com watch v ihqmzluqmmg t 156 repeat steps 14 16 for the other wing with one wing complete you re ready to turn the page over and repeat the same steps to form the other wing simply use the same folds from steps 14 16 but on the other side 19 x research source tuck in the points at the bottom the bottom of the penguin will still have points sticking out in a slightly misshapen way fold each of these points toward the inside of the penguin to make a flat horizontal bottom to the body 20 x research source once you tuck these flaps up you have your penguin get one white one black and one orange sheet of construction paper since origami can be a bit difficult and not very exciting for younger children the good old method of cutting and gluing construction paper might be more up their alley this method of making a paper penguin calls for one white one black and one orange sheet of construction paper 21 x research source trace an oval shape onto the black construction paper to form the body of the penguin have the child draw an oblong oval on the black construction paper with either a white crayon or a piece of chalk so that they can see the outline 22 x research source one fun and silly way to help the child make the shape is to have him or her place their shoe on the sheet and trace the outline of it 23 x research source cut out the black oval using a pair of scissors safety scissors for younger children have the child cut out the black oval from the construction paper when it comes to the eyes later you can have the child either draw them on the white paper or cut pupils out of the black paper for the latter you can have the child cut those out now as well trace a smaller oval onto the white construction paper you can now have the child trace the white portion of the belly on the white construction paper 24 x research source you can find something of the relative oblong shape to let the child trace it again or simply allow them to do it freehand glue the belly to the rest of the body once the child is done tracing the white oval allow them to cut the shape out of the construction paper then use a glue stick to glue the tummy portion to the rest of the body glue it closer to the bottom of the body portion than the middle since the head should be above it 25 x research source cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper to make the beak for the penguin have the child cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper 26 x research source the beak doesn t have to be an exact triangle so you can have the child trace it first or simply cut one out for very small children the size of the beak might be too difficult for them to cut out so you may have to help with this step glue the beak to the penguin s face you have two different options to glue the beak to the penguin s face you can either glue the triangle flat with one of the points facing downward or you can actually make a little fold on one of the flat sides and glue it at the tab which will make the beak stick out from the penguin s face make the penguin s eyes as mentioned earlier you can have the child draw eyes on the white construction paper cut them out and glue those to the penguin or you can also have the child cut the whites of the eyes from the white construction paper then use the black construction paper to cut out the pupils a third option if the child is too young to cut out such small circles is to have some googly eyes on hand from a craft store or the craft section of a big box store young kids may have an easier time using a glue stick to attach google eyes instead 27 x research source let the child customize it this makes an easy basic shape for the penguin and then the child can have fun customizing it if the child cuts out two really flattened ovals from the black paper he or she can glue them to the side of the body as wings if the child wants to make feet for the penguin you can have them trace a leaf or something else with the slight contours to give them the webbed shape,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a painted paper butterfly,butterflies come in all sorts of shapes sizes and colors they are pretty to look at but they can be hard to catch luckily it s possible to make your own butterfly with paint and paper with a little bit of creativity and a few extra supplies you can come up with a truly unique butterfly,crease a sheet of white paper down the middle fold your paper in half widthwise or hamburger style then unfold it the crease down the middle will be your guide 1 x research source the paper needs to have a smooth texture so something like cardstock printer paper or even a plain paper plate will all work do not use construction paper it will soak up the paint the size of the paper does not matter although larger pieces are easier to work with choose 2 to 3 colors pf paint you can use acrylic craft paint tempera paint or poster paint make sure that these colors look nice together especially when mixed for example red yellow and orange are a great combination blue pink and purple is another combination that works well don t use opposite colors such as red and green or you will get brown you can use white as 1 of your colors this will give you a pastel look use glittery or metallic paint as 1 of your colors if you want to give your butterfly extra sparkle 2 x research source drop 2 to 3 blobs of paint using your first color you can squirt the paint directly from the bottle or you can drop the paint with a spoon instead 3 x research source place some of the blobs closer to the crease and others further from the crease don t put the paint too close to the edge of the paper or it will squirt out when you squish it 4 x research source add a few more blobs using your other colors make 2 to 3 blobs using the other colors keep the blobs close together if they are too far apart they won t blend together and create a butterfly don t use too much paint or the paper will get soggy if you are starting to see more paint than white paper stop fold your paper back in half then press on it don t pick up the paper simply fold the left side over onto the right just like closing a book press on the paper with your fingers to squish the paint around you may feel the paint moving through the paper which is fine 5 x research source unfold the paper and let the paint dry each time you do this project you will get a different shape and combinations of colors sometimes the shapes look like butterflies and sometimes they look like something else 6 x research source set the paper aside so that it can dry this can take as little as 15 minutes to as long as an hour if your butterfly doesn t look like a butterfly at all you can cut the paper into a butterfly shape click here to learn how to turn painted paper into a cut out butterfly 7 x research source add a body and antennae if desired paint the body black or glue a row of black pompoms down the middle instead use a thin paintbrush and black paint to add 2 antennae above the butterfly s head you can also draw the antenna on with glitter glue instead make your butterfly fancier by decorating the wings with glitter glue and or rhinestones glue 2 googly eyes to the head if you want a silly butterfly squirt 2 to 3 colors of paint onto a sheet of white paper you can use acrylic craft paint tempera paint or poster paint cardstock or printer paper will work the best but you can use a paper plate too don t use construction paper as it will soak the paint up too much 8 x research source spread the paint around to cover the entire paper you can do this with a paintbrush or a sponge brush make sure that the different colors of paint touch but don t mix them together too much or you will get a solid color you want a sort of tie dye effect 9 x research source if you run out of paint simply squirt more on you want to cover as much of the paper as possible let the paper dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes this should not take very long at all about 15 to 20 minutes if the paper is taking too long to dry you can speed the process up with a hair dryer or by setting the paper out in the sun fold the paper in half widthwise or hamburger style bring the narrow ends of the paper together then flatten the paper it does not matter if the paint is on the outside or on the inside draw half of a butterfly on the paper with the body along the fold you can make up your own butterfly shape or you can use a stencil template you can make 1 big butterfly or you can make several smaller butterflies if you are making more than 1 butterfly make sure that they are all on the fold 10 x research source cut the paper along the line that you drew if you drew on the painted side of the paper make sure that you cut just inside the lines this way they won t show up when you finish your butterfly unfold the butterfly and decorate it if desired you can leave your butterfly the way it is or you can decorate it further with paint glue and other items if you do decide to decorate your butterfly make sure that you let it dry before moving on here are some decorating ideas glue pompoms down the middle for the body you can also use black paint instead fold a pipe cleaner into a v then glue it behind the head for the antenna glue tiny googly eyes to the head to make a face you can also paint eyes on instead paint designs onto the wings with black or white paint or glitter glue glue gemstones to the wings to make them sparkle thread string through the butterfly so that you can hang it up use a needle to thread some string through the top of the butterfly tie the ends of the string together so that you can hang it if you made many small butterflies you can thread them onto a longer piece of string and use them as a garland instead paint a slotted wooden clothespin with black or brown acrylic paint use a paintbrush with synthetic bristles to apply black or brown acrylic craft paint to the clothespin then let the paint dry this should only take about 15 to 20 minutes 11 x research source if you can t find craft paint you can use tempera paint or poster paint instead slotted clothespins look like dolls they have a round head a narrow neck and 2 thin legs they do not open and close like regular clothespins if you don t have clothespins use a craft stick instead you only need to paint 1 side 12 x research source paint a piece of white paper 2 to 3 different watercolors choose 2 to 3 different colors of watercolor and apply them to the paper in blobs with a watercolor brush let the colors flow together to create a tie dye effect choose colors that look nice when mixed together such as blue pink and purple 13 x research source don t use contrasting colors such as red and green or you may get brown where they mix construction paper will work the best but you can use printer paper too watercolor brushes are soft and made from camelhair don t use stiff brushes because they don t pick up enough paint set the paper aside so that it can dry this can take a few hours so you can do something else in the meantime if you can t wait you can dry the paper with a hairdryer or leave it out in the hot sun for a bit how long the paint takes to dry depends on what type of paper you used how wet you made it and so forth fold the paper into a fan starting from the narrow end fold the narrow edge down by 1 2 inch 1 3 cm turn the paper over and fold the edge down by another 1 2 inch 1 3 cm keep doing this until you reach the other end of the paper 14 x research source you can make the folds smaller than 1 2 inch 1 3 cm but don t make them bigger if you used a craft stick fold the paper in half and cut out a butterfly shape instead place the body of the butterfly on the fold 15 x research source slide the fan into the clothespin hold the fan by the middle and turn it so that the edges open up like a bowtie pinch the middle of the fan and slide it up into the slot on the clothespin you ll get something that looks like if you get something that looks like the fan is turned the wrong way 16 x research source secure the fan inside the clothespin with glue hot glue will work the best but you can use thick tacky glue too if you used a craft stick glue the cut out butterfly to the back of the stick the painted side of the paper needs to be facing up with the stick down the middle 17 x research source glue some googly eyes onto the head of the clothespin place 2 tiny drops of tacky glue hot glue or white school glue onto the round part of the clothespin next press 2 tiny googly eyes into the glue then let the glue dry 18 x research source make sure that you are gluing the eyes to the front of the butterfly if you don t have googly eyes you can use tiny buttons or pompoms instead make sure that they are small enough to fit on the head part of the clothespin wrap a pipecleaner around the neck to make the antenna make a v shape with a pipe cleaner wrap it around the neck of the clothespin just below the round head twist the pipe cleaner once or twice so that it holds 19 x research source black will be the most realistic but you can use any color you want if you are using a craft stick fold the pipe cleaner in half to make a v then hot glue it to the back of the stick shape the antenna into a v then curl the ends open up the pipe cleaner to make a v cut the ends down if you think they are too long use your finger a pen or a pencil to curl the ends of the pipe cleaner into spirals 20 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to make bunny envelopes for easter,a bunny envelope is a great way to deliver easter cards or treats a sealable envelope is great for cards while a pouch is better for treats both are fast and easy to make because of all the decorations you cannot send them in the mail you will have to deliver them in person or ask the easter bunny to do it for you,get an envelope with a pointed v shaped flap some envelopes have pointy v shaped flaps while others have straight horizontal flaps you want an envelope with a pointy v shaped flap this flap will create the bunny s face use a white envelope for a traditional bunny you can also use a different color like tan cut 2 bunny ears out of a sheet of paper that matches your envelope find a piece of cardstock or construction paper that is the same color as your envelope draw 2 bunny ears then cut them out 1 x research source bunny ears are shaped like long skinny leaves look at pictures of cartoon bunny ears if you need to you can also trace your index finger twice to make 2 bunny ears draw 2 smaller bunny ears on pink paper then cut them out trace the bunny ears you just cut out on a sheet of pink paper draw smaller bunny ears inside the pink ones then cut the smaller ears out 2 x research source you can use cardstock or construction paper you can also color plain white paper with pink crayons colored pencils or even watercolor paints make the pink ears about 1 4 to 1 2 inch 0 64 to 1 27 cm smaller than the white ears if you made a pink bunny make the smaller ears white add the pink ears on top of the white ears and glue them down make sure that the bottom edges of the pink ears touch the bottom edges of the white ears 3 x research source you can use a glue stick or tacky glue for this glue the ears behind the envelope so that the flap becomes the face turn the ears so that the pink side is facing up and move them 1 to 2 inches 2 5 to 5 1 cm apart coat the bottom 1 2 inch 1 3 cm of each ear with glue then set the envelope on top with the flap facing you 4 x research source the ears should stick out from behind the envelope the flap should be in the front and pointing down like a v draw 2 black eyes in the middle of the flap make the dots about the size of a pencil eraser for cartoon eyes draw a larger circle or oval around each eye if you want to give your bunny some lashes or eyebrows 5 x research source for a fancy bunny use googly eyes instead use tacky glue to attach them add a small pink bunny nose to the bottom of the flap make the nose shaped like an upside down triangle or an oval you can color the nose with a marker crayon or colored pencil 6 x research source for a fancier bunny attach a pink pompom to the bottom of the flap with tacky glue for a more realistic bunny draw some whiskers to the envelope to either side of the flap for a silly bunny draw some bunny teeth on the envelope below the flap place a note inside the envelope then seal the envelope shut instead of licking the entire bottom edge of the flap lick just the bottom point this will still close the envelope but it will make it easier to keep the bunny intact when you open it deliver this envelope personally you can t mail this envelope because of all the decorations write something like happy easter or spring is here on the note seal an envelope shut then turn it landscape style seal the envelope by licking or gluing it next turn the envelope so that 1 of the narrow edges is facing you it does not matter which side of the envelope is facing up front or back at this point 7 x research source do not put anything inside the envelope white is the best color for bunnies but you can use any color you want use a pencil to draw an arch at the bottom of the envelope for the head start the arch 2 to 3 inches 5 1 to 7 6 cm from the bottom of the envelope make it go from 1 side of the envelope to the other 8 x research source use a can bowl plate or lid to trace the arch don t let the ends of the arch touch the bottom corners of the envelope otherwise the pouch won t be deep enough to hold your treats add bunny ears to the top of the arch the bunny ears need to go from the top of the arch to the top edge of the envelope when you are done erase the arch s lines inside the ears for a nicer finish 9 x research source make the bunny ears shaped like long skinny leaves you can also copy a cartoon bunny s ears or trace around your index and middle fingers look at pictures of cartoon bunny ears to get an idea of how to draw them cut along the lines that you drew with scissors make sure that you cut through both sides of the envelope when you are done you should have a bunny head with a square bottom 10 x research source erase any pencil marks to make the bunny look neater cut smaller ears out of pink paper place your bunny shape on top of a sheet of pink paper then trace around the ears set the bunny shape aside then trace smaller ears inside the ones that you just drew cut the smaller ears out 11 x research source the pink ears should be about 1 4 to 1 2 inch 0 64 to 1 27 cm smaller than the bunny s ears use construction paper or cardstock you can also color your own paper with crayons colored pencils or watercolor paints glue the pink ears to the smooth side of the envelope your bunny shape will have a flap on 1 side and a smooth side on the other turn the envelope so that the smooth side is showing glue the pink ears onto the white ears 12 x research source a glue stick will work just fine for this but you can also use tacky glue draw 2 black eyes in the middle of the envelope keep the envelope turned with the smooth side facing you draw a pair of black eyes in the middle you can make them simple dots or cartoon eyes 13 x research source if you want a fancy bunny attach googly eyes instead with tacky glue give your bunny some character with eyebrows or lashes add a pink nose and a bunny mouth under the eyes make the nose shaped like an oval or an upside down triangle use a crayon marker or colored pencil to color it in give the bunny a mouth as well it should look like an upside down m 14 x research source if you want a fancy bunny use tacky glue to add a pink pompom for the nose instead add some whiskers for a more realistic bunny use a thin marker or pen to draw them fill the pouch with treats you can use candy or non candy treats if you are using candy treats place the candy into a small cellophane baggie first then tie the bag with ribbon this way the pouch won t get sticky here are some things you can put inside your pouch 15 x research

how to make balloon animals,learn how to make balloon animals and share your skill at a festival or party people love making a special request and seeing a colorful balloon animal come to life get familiar with the twisting techniques that form the foundation for every balloon animal then put your knowledge to use by making a balloon dog monkey and swan,make a basic twist inflate a balloon and tie it off at the end grasp it near the tie in your non dominant hand use your dominant hand to twist the balloon a few times so that you create a separate balloon segment in order to keep the balloon from untwisting hold the two segments with one hand use 260 balloons which are long balloons designed for the purpose of being made into balloon animals these are available at party stores and costume stores water balloons and party balloons can t be twisted into animal shapes you can inflate the balloons using your lungs but it s far easier to use a small hand pump these are available at toy stores and party stores that sell balloon supplies you should be able to grasp the balloon firmly without it popping keep your fingernails and jewelry away from the surface of the balloon so they don t catch on the rubber and pop it if the balloon seems to pop at the slightest touch try using a higher quality brand less expensive balloon brands use less rubber in their balloons and the thinner surface area is much easier to pop make a lock twist inflate a balloon tie it off and make two basic twists close together so that the balloon has a total of four segments hold all four segments in the same hand to keep them from coming untwisted use your other hand to grasp the two middle segments and gently hold them apart from the two end segments twist the two middle segments together three times then hold up the balloon the segments are now locked in place the lock twist is used to hold the balloon sculpture together since without it the balloon comes untwisted the lock twist is also used to make small balloon animal ears and other animal features make a fold twist inflate a balloon tie it off and make one basic twist near the end holding the twist in place with one hand use your other hand to fold the top of the balloon down grasp the twist and the top of the balloon and twist them together three times so that you form a loop the balloon now has three segments two end segments and one loop segment the fold twist functions like a lock twist in that it prevents the balloon from becoming untwisted the fold twist is often used to create ears noses and other animal features inflate the balloon and leave a 3 inch tail just keep blowing until the air has inflated the balloon to about three inches from the end then stop blowing and tie off the balloon make three basic twists starting at the knotted end of the balloon make three basic twists to create a total of four balloon segments the first segment which includes the balloon s knot will form the dog s snout it is slightly longer than the second two segments which will form the dog s ears the last segment which will be twisted into the dog s body is the longest hold all of the segments in one hand to prevent them from becoming untwisted since they have not yet been locked experiment with different segment lengths for the snout and ear segments you can also make an extra long snout and call your balloon animal an anteater twist the ear segments together use your free hand to grasp the second and third segments the ear segments and twist them together three times this lock twist will keep them from coming untwisted do you see the dog s head make three more basic twists make the first twist a few inches below the head to form a neck segment make two more twists below the neck to create two segments that are equal in length these will be the front legs hold all the new segments in the same hand to prevent them from coming untwisted would you rather have a giraffe than a dog make the neck segment extra long the rest of the body is exactly the same you can make the leg segments long or short but they should be the same length twist the leg segments together fold the balloon at the twist between the two leg segments grasp the leg segments with your free hand and twist them together three times at the base of the neck the legs and neck are now locked in place make three more basic twists this time divide the remaining length of the balloon into four equal segments the first segment is the dog s body the second two segments will become the back legs of the dog and the final segment is the tail hold them all in one hand to prevent them from becoming untwisted twist the back legs together fold the balloon at the twist between the two back leg segments grasp the segments and twist them three times at the base of the body segment take a look at your finished sculpture it has a knotted nose short ears front legs and back legs and a tail that sticks straight up your work is complete inflate the balloon and leave a 6 inch tail leaving a shorter tail might result in the balloon popping halfway through the sculpting process so make sure you have plenty of uninflated balloon at the end tie off the balloon with a knot make a basic twist twist the balloon a few inches from the knot to create a small segment that will be the monkey s face hold both segments in one hand to prevent them from untwisting make a short fold twist start by making a second basic twist close to the first one so that you have a small segment in between the twists fold the segment so that the two twists line up use your free hand to grasp the folded segment and twist it three times to lock it in place you ve just made the monkey s first ear make another basic twist a couple of inches from the first ear make another basic twist to create a short segment hold it in one hand so that it doesn t untwist this new short segment will be the monkey s forehead make another short fold twist start by making a second basic twist close to the first one so that you have a new small segment between the twists fold this segment so that the two twists line up use you free hand to grasp the folded segment and twist it three times to lock it in place this is the monkey s second ear twist the ears together carefully grasp the two ears by the twists at their bases the forehead segment will be sticking out between them twist the ears together three times to lock them in place the monkey s head is now complete it has a nose a forehead and two ears make three more basic twists make the first twist a few inches below the head to form the neck segment make two more twists lower down to form two segments that are equal in length these will become the monkey s arms hold all of the segments in one hand to prevent them from untwisting twist the arms together fold the balloon at the twist between the two arm segments grasp the segments and twist them three times at the base of the neck segment to lock the arms and neck in place the balloon should now resemble a monkey with a head neck and arms make three more basic twists make the first twist a few inches below the arms to form the body segment make two more twists lower down to form two segments that are equal in length these will become the monkey s legs hold all of the segments in one hand to prevent them from untwisting leave plenty of room at the end of the balloon for the tail which should be the longest segment of all twist the legs together fold the balloon at the twist between the two leg segments grasp the segments and twist them together three times at the base of the body the body and legs are now locked in place and the tail is hanging down from the body make a coconut tree trunk choose a balloon in a contrasting color and inflate it completely then tie it off there s no need to leave a tail at the end slide it between the monkey s arms and legs so that the monkey appears to be climbing it inflate a balloon and leave a 4 inch tail white or black balloons both make striking swan sculptures fold the balloon create a paperclip shape with the balloon the knotted end should be at the center of the paperclip and the tail end should jut out from the end of the paperclip another way to approach this shape is to create a circle with overlapping ends then flatten it make a basic twist grasp the folded balloon in the middle so that you re holding three parts the top of the paperclip the bottom of the paperclip and the knot in the center twist the three parts together making sure you catch the knot in the twist hold the twist to make sure it doesn t come undone you now have two loops with a long neck jutting out from the center twist tuck one loop into the other use your free hand to close one of the loops and push it up through the other one this creates the body of the swan with the tucked in loop resembling folded wings and the outer loop resembling the swan s underside tucking in the loop also keeps the structure from coming undone make the head grasp the neck a few inches from the tail and use your hand to move some of the air into the uninflated tail part this will cause the top of the neck to curve into the shape of the head the remaining uninflated tail forms the swan s beak,Pets-and-Animals

how to make a beaded lizard,here s a cute fun and creative afternoon activity that you can make and attach to your backpack or even wear as a necklace all it takes are some beads string and a keychain clasp,cut a roughly three foot length of 1 8th inch ribbon or string the longer the string the longer the lizard three feet is a good start fold the string in half so that the two ends meet this will lead to a loop at the other end of the string take the loop and run it through the bottom of a keychain clasp really any sort of clasp will work all you need to do is create a slipknot around the clasp you should have your loop on one side of the clasp and the long excess string on the other pull the ends through the loop to create a slipknot reach into the loop and pull the strings through pulling until tight this creates a simple slip knot that will hold the lizard in place as you work tape the clasp down to the table so that the strings drape towards you make sure the strings are not tangled up and that you can clearly tell which string is the left string and which one is the right add two beads to the leftmost string these beads will be your body so choose the color you want for the bulk of the lizard don t feed the beads all the way down just let them dangle a bit towards the end in this video the body will be yellow thread the right string through the beads the opposite way if the leftmost string enters through the left thread this one through from the right you ll have both string going through the center of the two beads in opposite directions pull both ends of the strings until the beads slide up to the keychain clasp lightly pull on the opposite ends to force the beads up to the top feed three more beads two eyes and a body color onto the leftmost string you want to sandwich the body bead with the two eye colors here the eyes are green and the body is yellow so you d put them on as green yellow green slide the right side through the beads and pull both ends until the beads slide to the top repeat the same procedure as you did with the first two body beads slide the three beads on the left string thread the right through them then pull both strings to move the beads to the top repeat the whole procedure with two more beads to make the neck take two body colors thread them on the left slide the right through and pull tight this is your neck take three more body beads and pull them through again it is the same procedure for a little flair you can use a different color for the center bead here allowing you to put a stripe on your lizard s back these three beads are the beginning of the back you ll need to start the limbs after this set aside two beads for the body and three other beads for the feet here the body beads are still yellow and the feet will be black thread the two body beads on the left string and slide them down close to the body push them almost all the way to the body these are your legs slide the black beads on just above the legs keep them close but separated thread the end of the left string through the two beads for the leg you just want to thread through your two yellow beads not the three for the feet pull the string tight to pull everything together adjusting slightly as necessary use your fingers to make sure nothing bunches up this is your first leg note how it only requires the left string to make you should never touch the right one when making the left leg repeat the process with the other string to make the right leg once done it is time to move back to the body build three more body rows identically to the first put three beads on the left string remembering to alternate them if you re doing a two colored body then slide the right string in the opposite direction as the left and pull the two ends to slide the beads up to the body you need three more rows before starting the feet again make two more legs the same way you made the first two after the three lengths of the body add two more legs the process is identical add two more body beads to make the base of the tail identical to the neck you should have the process down pat by now two beads on the left string feed through the right string and pull tight slide the first tail bead on the left string thread the right string through the opposite side and pull the tail is simply the same process as the body but its only one bead per layer you can choose any color you want alternating looks great too and you can use as many beads as you want for the length of tail you like tie a double knot at the end of the tail to keep the beads in place you can tie any knot you want but a simple square knot will do just fine you can use the knot used to tie your shoes as well but make sure you double knot it 1 x research source,Pets-and-Animals

how to make bottle penguins,there are lots of ways to recycle plastic soda bottles and turning them into adorable penguins is one of them with a little bit of paint time and creativity you can turn 2 plastic soda bottles into an adorable penguin if you have a lot of plastic soda bottles then you can create an entire penguin family,find 2 plastic soda bottles the large 2 liter 67 2 oz bottles will work the best for this but you can use smaller soda bottles too look for the kind that have the 4 bumps on the bottom these bumps will make the feet and the hat the color of the bottles does not matter you will be painting it remove the labels and wash the bottles peel the labels off first then wash the bottles inside out with soap and warm water be sure to remove all sticker residue dry the bottles with a towel wipe the bottles down with rubbing alcohol as well this will remove any oils that might keep the paint from sticking let the bottles dry this should only take a few seconds cut the bottles in half and recycle the top sections a craft blade will work the best for this but you can do it with a sharp pair of scissors too young children should be supervised during this step 1 x research source if the cut edge is jagged cut it smoother with a pair of scissors for a smaller penguin cut the bottom 2 to 3 inches 5 1 to 7 6 cm off of the first bottle and cut the second bottle in half the shorter half will make the bottom 2 x research source tuck 1 bottle inside the other to make a capsule turn the bottles so that the cut edges are facing one another slide the first bottle into the second bottle by about 1 2 to 1 inch 1 3 to 2 5 cm if the bottles won t fit inside one another cut a 1 2 to 1 in 1 3 to 2 5 cm slit into 1 of the bottles first place this edge on the inside 3 x research source make sure that the 4 bumps on the top and bottom of the capsule line up glue the bottles together if desired if the bottles are loose glue them together with tacky glue or super glue pull the bottles apart and paint the inside rim of 1 bottle with glue slide it over the other bottle 4 x research source hot glue is not recommended because it is too bulky alternatively you can keep the bottles loose and use the penguin as a gift box paint the entire capsule black then let it dry take the capsule outside or into a well ventilated area set it down on a sheet of newspaper then coat it with black spray paint let the paint dry for 15 to 20 minutes then turn the capsule over spray paint the bottom and let it dry completely hold the can 8 to 10 inches 20 to 25 cm from the capsule and spray using a side to side motion if the paint is too thin let it dry completely then apply another coat of paint if you don t have spray paint paint the capsule using black acrylic craft paint and a paintbrush paint the penguin s face and belly white then allow them to dry use a pointed paintbrush and white acrylic craft paint to outline the white face and belly of the penguin fill your outline in using a flat paintbrush let the paint dry then add another layer if the first layer is too thin let the second layer dry too if you added it look at pictures of real or cartoon penguins to get ideas for the placement of the white parts make sure that 2 of the bumps on the base of the capsule line up with the bottom of the penguin s belly these are its feet if you are making a smaller penguin use the shorter half to make the bottom 5 x research source give the penguin a widow s peak if desired use a pointed brush and black acrylic craft paint to draw a v shape at the top of the penguin s white face fill the v shape in with black paint so that it blends in with the body for an even nicer finish made the sides of the v shape curved so that it looks like mickey mouse s widow s peak let the paint dry before moving on 6 x research source paint 2 eyes and a beak using acrylic craft paint use a yellow upside down triangle for the beak and 2 black dots for the eyes for a more realistic beak paint a yellow or orange circle then draw a horizontal black line going through the middle look at pictures of cartoon penguins to get ideas you can also hot glue 2 buttons or 2 googly eyes for the eyes if you don t have yellow paint cut a triangle out of yellow paper and glue that on instead 7 x research source give your penguin character with lashes eyebrows and or blush you don t have to do any of these but they can really give your penguin personality use a very thin brush for the lashes and or eyebrows or a paint pen use a larger pointed brush to apply pink paint for the blush if you want to give your penguin visible yellow feet paint the 2 bumps in the front under the white bellow with yellow acrylic craft paint paint the top half of the bottle to turn it into a hat the 4 bumps on top of your penguin s head can easily turn into a hat paint a line around the penguin s head just above the eyes then fill in everything above that line use whatever color you want 8 x research source if you have a molded line just below the bumps you can use that as a guide instead let the hat dry then add some details you can make the hat look more hat like by painting or drawing some stripes or spots onto it use a thin pointed paintbrush and acrylic craft paint in a contrasting color to do this let the paint dry when you are done use a paint pen for thin stripes or small dots glue a pompom to the top of the hat if desired you can make the pompom yourself out of yarn or you can buy it from the kids section of a craft store hot glue the pompom to the top of the hat right between all 4 bumps 9 x research source choose a pompom color that matches the designs on your hat if you did not add designs then use a contrasting color instead tie ribbon around the neck to make a scarf find some ribbon that goes well with the hat wrap the ribbon around the penguin s neck then cross the left end over the right end bring the left end up through the gap then tighten it this is just like starting to tie a pair of shoes 10 x research source glue both ends of the ribbon to the penguin so that they stay down if you are turning this into a gift box make sure that you keep the ribbon below the seam you can also cut a long skinny strip out of felt and use that instead of ribbon cut fringes into each end for additional charm 11 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a bird out of a plastic straw,this project is a fun and easy example of plastic straw art plastic straw birds are a unique decoration to add to cocktails cupcakes or other little delicacies and are sure to set a lively mood and garner many compliments from your recipients,cut the straw observe that the straw is divided into two sections by the bendy part one section is longer than the other cut the longer section halfway between the end and the bend cut the short piece open cut it lengthwise keeping your cut as straight as possible you may want to trace the cut with a marker before cutting flatten the piece place the cut piece on a folded towel or hard surface and flatten it with the edge of a spoon fold the piece in half hamburger style see the photo for more help cut symmetrical wings on both sides of the fold make sure they stay connected in the middle cut small slits around the edges of the wings to make the feather tips set aside the wings for now flatten the other parts of the straw as you did with the other piece use the edge of a spoon to flatten the rest of the straw except for the bend cut out the tail once the straw has been flattened position your scissors so that they cut through both layers just slightly inward from one of the edges created by the fold cut all the way up to the bend this will be the tail of the bird cut the legs on the portion of the straw you just cut position your scissors so that they cut exactly along the other fold stopping at the bend you should end up with three pieces on this portion of the straw two thick legs and one slim tail bend the legs and tail outward they should resemble the legs of a tripod position the bend in the straw so that it resembles the neck of a bird make two cuts just above the bend of the straw angled toward the center you should end up with what looks like the bill of a bird wrap the legs around the tail position the straw so that the tail is on top and pointing back toward you grab one of the legs and fold it under the tail then take the end of that leg and pull it over the tail and through the loop you created don t pull it tight just yet though repeat the same process with the other leg tighten both legs at the same time once both of the legs are in position tighten them slowly and symmetrically so that they make a knot where the tail meets the bend make sure the legs point downward they should be at a 90 degree angle from the tail push the tail toward the bend to loosen it a bit and slip the wings through the opening tighten the tail into place again make small feather cuts in the tail flatten it with the edge of a spoon for better effect display the bird on a glass by putting the rim between the two legs cut the straw observe that the straw is divided

how to make a bird nest,a bird s nest makes a wonderful mantelpiece decoration and can make use of almost anything you find along a nature hike or in your front yard wild birds usually prefer to make their own nests but you can lure many species to your yard by leaving the right materials outside or building a nesting box,find long flexible plant stems these will form the main shape of the nest and are much easier to work with than hard short twigs you can use straw long grass vines willow fronds bendy reeds or seagrass found outdoors or at a garden supply store raffia is another good option obtainable from a craft supply store 1 x research source if mexican feather grass grows in your area grab a clump of it and pull your hand upward to remove a handful of hairy seeds clinging together once you have enough seeds clump them into a ball and make a nest shape by sticking your thumb into it bend the stems into a loop grab a thick handful of the stems and bend them into a u shape adding more stems if necessary to form a full circle tie it in place using a piece of string or florist wire if the plant stems have many little leaves or if they re wiry and dry you can even weave them together without using any attachment if tying the nest together is too hard you can clip them temporarily in place while waiting for glue to dry 2 x research source don t use glue if you plan to keep the nest outdoors if your fresh cut plants won t stay in position try hanging up the bundle in a windy area to dry for 24 hours some plant stems are easier to bend when fresh but grasses and straw benefit from drying shape the rest of the nest grab a second smaller handful of stems and shape it into a smaller loop wedge this inside the larger loop and push it downward to form the base of the loop depending on how well the stems fit together and how sturdy you want the nest to be you may need to use a thread or glue to fasten the two loops together decorate with scavenged materials real birds sometimes spend days collecting bits and pieces to build a nest hopefully you re a little faster but you can still have fun gathering objects from nature or your craft boxes here are some ideas to get you started if you plan to leave the nest outside only use materials found outdoors and nothing that could hurt an animal feathers and pieces of eggshell fit the theme be aware that collecting most wild feathers is illegal in the united states but they are mostly harmless from a disease perspective 3 x research source 4 x research source 5 x trustworthy source science buddies expert sourced database of science projects explanations and educational material go to source look for twigs leaves bark and moss in interesting shapes and colors if the nest is for indoor decoration you can use bits of string colored paper shreds and confetti place eggs inside optional finish your art project by placing eggs or fake eggs inside the nest you can quickly add marbles or colorful pebbles or hollow out real eggs decorate them or even carve them if you have the right tools look up the nesting habits of local birds find a local wildlife guide at a library or bookstore or search online for information on local birds choose one or more species you want to attract and look up their nesting habits to discover what shape and style of nest will be most effective if you live in north america nestwatch is an excellent resource for nesting information and one you can expand with your own data 6 x research source leave nesting material in your yard this is an easy way to attract birds and might be worth it even if you end up building a full nest as well if you managed to find specific nesting information you ll know what materials to leave but you can t go wrong with a few items from the following list left in visible locations 7 x trustworthy source the humane society of the united states national organization devoted to the promotion of animal welfare go to source rigid twigs for platform nest species and flexible ones for cup nest species yard clippings such as dry grass and straw bits of bark and moss dead leaves etc human or animal hair or fur no longer than 6 inches 15 centimeters yarn or string mud spiderwebs and or caterpillar cocoons to help birds bind nesting materials together never leave out materials that have come into contact with harsh chemicals including dye pesticides or anti flea treatments dryer lint and clothing rags are not recommended provide a variety of plants if you want to attract birds that make nests in existing holes leave dead tree stumps and fallen logs in the yard living trees and bushes will attract more visible nests from other species especially if the plants are native to your area for best results plant a staircase of grass or moss flowering perennials shrubs and trees 8 x research source build a nesting box if there aren t obvious crevices or hollows in your yard building a nesting box or birdhouse is a simple carpentry project make sure the birdhouse is constructed to match the size of the birds you want to attract or the size of the birds you see flying near your home for a higher chance of success follow birdhouse building instructions specific to common north american species clean out the birdhouse regularly whenever birds are not nesting make a bird s nest many birds prefer to make their own nest rather than move in to a ready made one lining natural hollows with the nesting materials listed above may give a bird an attractive head start if you want to make a different type of nest such as a cup or platform nest it s best to follow the specific habits of the bird species you want to attract each species tends to prefer certain materials placement of the nest is also important many bird species hide their nest amidst thick branches but some prefer more open branches bushes or open patches of ground look for more information on nestwatch through online searches or in a local bird nest

eyes for a fun alternative to drawing the eyes paste the body to the middle of the feathers to finish your peacock put white craft glue on the back of the peacock s body then press it down in the middle of the paper plate line up its bottom with the bottom of the plate let it dry completely before you hang it up 11 x research source you can continue decorating and painting your peacock even after it has been glued together if you want fold a piece of construction paper accordion style for taller feathers fold it lengthwise for wider feathers fold it widthwise each fold should be about 1 in 2 5 cm wide or smaller make a fold flip the paper over and fold that same length of paper back to create another strip continue flipping the paper over and making folds until the entire thing is one strip wide 12 x research source each fold essentially becomes a feather use purple blue green or yellow paper unfold the paper so it s flat and decorate each strip to resemble a feather unfold the paper so that you can see the entirety of it use markers pens or paint to create small designs across each feather small circles or teardrop shapes are common for peacocks use a plain black marker to keep things simple or branch out and use different colors 13 x research source you only need to decorate one side of the piece of paper refold the paper and glue the bottom edges together after you ve designed the feathers and your design has dried go ahead and refold that piece of paper then put some white craft glue along the bottom folds on one side and press them together to create the bottom of the fan hold the paper together until it sticks on its own 14 x research source this creates the beautiful backdrop of feathers for your peacock it should resemble a half circle once it s stretched out so you can see the design you made draw the body of a peacock on a differently colored piece of paper a bowling pin shape works really well make the body about 2 3 the height of the feathers go ahead and cut out the body and lay it on top of the feathers to make sure it looks proportional if you need to cut out another one or use a different color of paper until you achieve the look you desire 15 x research source choose a color different from what you used for the feathers try to pick something that ll pop like a yellow body with purple feathers or a light blue body with green feathers make legs a beak and eyes out of construction paper cut out 2 thin l shapes for the feet a triangle for the beak and circles for the eyes use a different color of paper from what you used for the body 16 x research source you could also use googly eyes or simply draw the other body parts in place if you don t want to cut them out glue the body parts onto the main body put the legs at the bottom of the body and make the feet face the same direction glue the eyes in place near the top of the body and use a marker to create the pupils put the triangle sideways beneath the eyes to create the peacock s beak 17 x research source feel free to decorate the body of the peacock even further if you d like secure the body to the feathers with glue spread out the feathers so that there is a flat bottom take a glue stick and rub it over the ridges in the middle of the feathers gently press the peacock s body down over the glued section hold it for several seconds so it ll stay in place 18 x research source you could also use double sided tape to attach the 2 pieces,Pets-and-Animals
how to make papier mâché eggs,papier mâché eggs are both easy and fun to make you can paint them bright colors and use them as easter decorations or you can paint them to look like real wild bird eggs and display them in your room they do take a few days to dry but they are a great hands on activity which many children love when you are finished you can even fill them with candies and crack them open later,blow up a balloon tie the end into a knot and set it down in a small cup the cup will prevent the balloon from rolling away while you work mix 2 parts white school glue with one part water in a small bowl this will be your papier mâché glue 1 x research source tear some paper into small squares or rectangles newspaper works best but you can also use plain newsprint paper from the craft store instead don t cut the paper the ragged edges will help the paper seal together and give you a smoother finish consider using both newspaper and tissue paper this way when you do multiple layers you will be able to see which one you are working on 2 x research source avoid using plain printer paper or construction paper both are too thick and too stiff for this project dip a paper strip into the glue and place it onto the balloon drag the strip across the edge of the bowl as you pull it out this will remove any excess glue place it down near the top of the balloon use your fingers or a paintbrush to smooth the paper down so that it lays flat against the balloon continue applying the paper strips until the balloon is completely covered overlap the strips slightly as you work from one end of the balloon to the other work your way from the top of the balloon all the way down to the tail end do not cover the tail or you won t be able to remove the balloon apply a second layer of paper you don t have to dip these strips of paper into the glue simply stick them to the wet paper that s already on the balloon and use your fingers or a paintbrush to smooth down the edges 3 x research source consider using a tissue paper or plain newsprint for this layer this way you will be able to see what s cover and what isn t two layers is ideal for eggs that you want to cut open if you want a sturdier egg apply a third layer you may have to use some extra glue for this one 4 x research source hang the balloon up to dry use a clothespin to clip the balloon to a hanger or clothesline wait for it to dry completely before moving on it may take up to 2 or 3 days 5 x research source pop and remove the balloon once the egg is completely dry gently tug the balloon tail up so that you expose a bit of the balloon pierce it with a pin or pair of scissors and wait for the balloon to deflate once it is completely deflated pull it out and discard it cover the hole with 2 to 3 layers of paper and glue and wait for it to dry use the same technique as you did for the rest of your egg if you wish to fill your egg then do so before covering up the hole paint the egg a solid color using acrylic or tempra paint and wait for it to dry to make the paint really stand out coat the entire egg using white primer and let it dry once you have your white base you can paint your egg any color you want add patterns to the eggs if desired once your base color has dried you can paint designs onto it you can also draw designs using glitter glue or puffy paints instead 6 x research source great easter designs include stripes dots and squiggles try to use soft pastel colors consider giving the eggs a final coating of gloss once all the paint has dried spray or paint the eggs with a glossy sealer you can even use a glittery sealer to give it some extra sparkle this will help make them more durable if you d like you can cut the egg in half using jagged zigzag lines so that it resembles a cracked open egg when you are done you can fill each half with fake grass and place a little chick or bunny figure in each blow up a water balloon tie the end into a knot and set it down into a cup the cup will hold the balloon sturdy while you work pour some liquid starch or decoupage glue into a bowl you can also mix your own glue by using 2 parts white school glue and 1 part water cut the white tissue paper into 1½ inch 3 81 centimeters squares and set it aside this will make the base for your egg one sheet will be enough to coat three eggs cut the colored tissue paper into 1½ inch 3 81 centimeters squares and set it aside this will make the outside of your egg you can make it all one color or many different colors some crafters have noted that lighter colored tissue paper such as yellow shows the layering and overlapping more 7 x research source to make polka dot eggs punch a ¾ inch 1 91 centimeters circle in the center of your square using a scrapbooking hole punch discard the circles and use the squares so that you get white polkadots on your egg 8 x research source start applying the base layer using the white tissue paper brush on some of your glue onto the balloon and press a piece of white tissue paper onto it smooth it down with a brush dipped in more glue overlap the pieces as you cover the entire egg start applying the tissue paper at the top of the balloon and work your way towards the tail don t cover the tail up 9 x research source apply the colored layer if the tissue paper on the balloon is already damp you do not need to apply more glue simply press a piece of colored tissue paper onto it and smooth it down with a little more glue 10 x research source remember to overlap the pieces by a little if you are making polka dotted eggs be careful not to cover up the white polka dots hang the balloon up to dry overnight you can do this by clipping the tail of the balloon to a hanger or to a clothesline this can take 2 to 3 days pop and remove the balloon make sure that the balloon is completely dry then gently tug on the balloon tail until you expose a bit of the balloon pierce the balloon with a pin or a pair of scissors wait for the balloon to deflate then pull it out and discard it fill the egg with candy if desired small candies such as chocolate eggs work great be careful not to overfill the egg it is still very fragile if you do not wish to fill your egg you can move onto the next step cover the hole with 2 to 3 more layers of colored tissue paper 11 x research source use the same technique as you did when first covering the egg let the patch covering the hole dry before moving on because these eggs are made from colorful tissue paper they don t need to be painted you can still decorate them however with glitter glue if you d like give the eggs away as gifts or use them as decorations to open the eggs simply tear them apart they make great gifts for easter baskets,Pets-and-Animals

how to make bottle penguins,there are lots of ways to recycle plastic soda bottles and turning them into adorable penguins is one of them with a little bit of paint time and creativity you can turn 2 plastic soda bottles into an adorable penguin if you have a lot of plastic soda bottles then you can create an entire penguin family,find 2 plastic soda bottles the large 2 liter 67 2 oz bottles will work the best for this but you can use smaller soda bottles too look for the kind that have the 4 bumps on the bottom these bumps will make the feet and the hat the color of the bottles does not matter you will be painting it remove the labels and wash the bottles peel the labels off first then wash the bottles inside out with soap and warm water be sure to remove all sticker residue dry the bottles with a towel wipe the bottles down with rubbing alcohol as well this will remove any oils that might keep the paint from sticking let the bottles dry this should only take a few seconds cut the bottles in half and recycle the top sections a craft blade will work the best for this but you can do it with a sharp pair of scissors too young children should be supervised during this step 1 x research source if the cut edge is jagged cut it smoother with a pair of scissors for a smaller penguin cut the bottom 2 to 3 inches 5 1 to 7 6 cm off of the first bottle and cut the second bottle in half the shorter half will make the bottom 2 x research source tuck 1 bottle inside the other to make a capsule turn the bottles so that the cut edges are facing one another slide the first bottle into the second bottle by about 1 2 to 1 inch 1 3 to 2 5 cm if the bottles won t fit inside one another cut a 1 2 to 1 in 1 3 to 2 5 cm slit into 1 of the bottles first place this edge on the inside 3 x research source make sure that the 4 bumps on the top and bottom of the capsule line up glue the bottles together if desired if the bottles are loose glue them together with tacky glue or super glue pull the bottles apart and paint the inside rim of 1 bottle with glue slide it over the other bottle 4 x research source hot glue is not recommended because it is too bulky alternatively you can keep the bottles loose and use the penguin as a gift box paint the entire capsule black then let it dry take the capsule outside or into a well ventilated area set it down on a sheet of newspaper then coat it with black spray paint let the paint dry for 15 to 20 minutes then turn the capsule over spray paint the bottom and let it dry completely hold the can 8 to 10 inches 20 to 25 cm from the capsule and spray using a side to side motion if the paint is too thin let it dry completely then apply another coat of paint if you don t have spray paint paint the capsule using black acrylic craft paint and a paintbrush paint the penguin s face and belly white then allow them to dry use a pointed paintbrush and white acrylic craft paint to outline the white face and belly of the penguin fill your outline in using a flat paintbrush let the paint dry then add another layer if the first layer is too thin let the second layer dry too if you added it look at pictures of real or cartoon penguins to get ideas for the placement of the white parts make sure that 2 of the bumps on the base of the capsule line up with the bottom of the penguin s belly these are its feet if you are making a smaller penguin use the shorter half to make the bottom 5 x research source give the penguin a widow s peak if desired use a pointed brush and black acrylic craft paint to draw a v shape at the top of the penguin s white face fill the v shape in with black paint so that it blends in with the body for an even nicer finish made the sides of the v shape curved so that it looks like mickey mouse s widow s peak let the paint dry before moving on 6 x research source paint 2 eyes and a beak using acrylic craft paint use a yellow upside down triangle for the beak and 2 black dots for the eyes for a more realistic beak paint a yellow or orange circle then draw a horizontal black line going through the middle look at pictures of cartoon penguins to get ideas you can also hot glue 2 buttons or 2 googly eyes for the eyes if you don t have yellow paint cut a triangle out of yellow paper and glue that on instead 7 x research source give your penguin character with lashes eyebrows and or blush you don t have to do any of these but they can really give your penguin personality use a very thin brush for the lashes and or eyebrows or a paint pen use a larger pointed brush to apply pink paint for the blush if you want to give your penguin visible yellow feet paint the 2 bumps in the front under the white bellow with yellow acrylic craft paint paint the top half of the bottle to turn it into a hat the 4 bumps on top of your penguin s head can easily turn into a hat paint a line around the penguin s head just above the eyes then fill in everything above that line use whatever color you want 8 x research source if you have a molded line just below the bumps you can use that as a guide instead let the hat dry then add some details you can make the hat look more hat like by painting or drawing some stripes or spots onto it use a thin pointed paintbrush and acrylic craft paint in a contrasting color to do this let the paint dry when you are done use a paint pen for thin stripes or small dots glue a pompom to the top of the hat if desired you can make the pompom yourself out of yarn or you can buy it from the kids section of a craft store hot glue the pompom to the top of the hat right between all 4 bumps 9 x research source choose a pompom color that matches the designs on your hat if you did not add designs then use a contrasting color instead tie ribbon around the neck to make a scarf find some ribbon that goes well with the hat wrap the ribbon around the penguin s neck then cross the left end over the right end bring the left end up through the gap then tighten it this is just like starting to tie a pair of shoes 10 x research source glue both ends of the ribbon to the penguin so that they stay down if you are turning this into a gift box make sure that you keep the ribbon below the seam you can also cut a long skinny strip out of felt and use that instead of ribbon cut fringes into each end for additional charm 11 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a bird out of a plastic straw,this project is a fun and easy example of plastic straw art plastic straw birds are a unique decoration to add to cocktails cupcakes or other little delicacies and are sure to set a lively mood and garner many compliments from your recipients,cut the straw observe that the straw is divided into two sections by the bendy part one section is longer than the other cut the longer section halfway between the end and the bend cut the short piece open cut it lengthwise keeping your cut as straight as possible you may want to trace the cut with a marker before cutting flatten the piece place the cut piece on a folded towel or hard surface and flatten it with the edge of a spoon fold the piece in half hamburger style see the photo for more help cut symmetrical wings on both sides of the fold make sure they stay connected in the middle cut small slits around the edges of the wings to make the feather tips set aside the wings for now flatten the other parts of the straw as you did with the other piece use the edge of a spoon to flatten the rest of the straw except for the bend cut out the tail once the straw has been flattened position your scissors so that they cut through both layers just slightly inward from one of the edges created by the fold cut all the way up to the bend this will be the tail of the bird cut the legs on the portion of the straw you just cut position your scissors so that they cut exactly along the other fold stopping at the bend you should end up with three pieces on this portion of the straw two thick legs and one slim tail bend the legs and tail outward they should resemble the legs of a tripod position the bend in the straw so that it resembles the neck of a bird make two cuts just above the bend of the straw angled toward the center you should end up with what looks like the bill of a bird wrap the legs around the tail position the straw so that the tail is on top and pointing back toward you grab one of the legs and fold it under the tail then take the end of that leg and pull it over the tail and through the loop you created don t pull it tight just yet though repeat the same process with the other leg tighten both legs at the same time once both of the legs are in position tighten them slowly and symmetrically so that they make a knot where the tail meets the bend make sure the legs point downward they should be at a 90 degree angle from the tail push the tail toward the bend to loosen it a bit and slip the wings through the opening tighten the tail into place again make small feather cuts in the tail flatten it with the edge of a spoon for better effect display the bird on a glass by putting the rim between the two legs cut the straw observe that the straw is divided into two sections by the bendy part one section is longer than the other cut the longer section halfway between the end and the bend cut the short piece open cut it lengthwise keeping your cut as

how to make a paper penguin,whether as a crafts project for a small child or as an origami project for older people there are plenty of ways to make a paper penguin that are fun for people of any age,purchase origami paper this method calls for just a single sheet of 6 x 6 origami paper if you want a larger penguin then you can easily go for 12 x 12 paper but you ll have to multiply any directions containing measurements by two if you want an even better looking penguin buy paper that is white on one side and black on the other 1 x research source fold diagonal creases along the middle to start you want to place the sheet of origami paper flat with the white side facing up if you have paper with a black side as well then fold the paper in half diagonally so the bottom left corner is flush with the top right corner and make a crease unfold the paper and do the same with the opposite corners and then unfold the page again 2 x research source when you unfold the sheet again you will have creases forming a large x across the page 3 x research source fold the lower left corner to the center with the page flat again and the large creases making an x you will then take the lower left corner of the paper and fold it so that the tip of the corner touches the center of the page in other words the corner edge will touch the center of the x made by the earlier creases 4 x research source flatten the folded portion and make another crease then open the sheet so it s flat again fold the upper right corner to the crease you just made you will now have the large x crease as well as a smaller diagonal crease in the lower left of the page take the top right corner of the page and fold it over so that it touches the lower left crease 5 x research source then open the page once more turn the page over for the next set of folds you ll need to turn the page over if you have two colored paper this means that the black side will now faces up when you turn the paper over orient it diagonally so that the current lower left corner now points up 6 x research source fold the left corner to the right corner with the paper in the new orientation take the corner pointing left and fold the paper in half so that it s flush with the corner pointing right 7 x research source there will already be a crease here from when you made this fold on the other side of the sheet but you ll need to crease it in the opposite direction when you fold it over fold the bottom corner over to the right from the last step the sheet will now look like a triangle with the side on the left forming a vertical line take the corner of the triangle that points down and fold it across at a 45 angle 8 x research source fold it so that the horizontal edge made at the top of the fold touches the lower crease already on this part of the page not the middle crease but the one below it 9 x research source once you ve made the crease from this fold turn the flap back over so that you have the same triangle shape you started with reverse fold the corner along the crease you just made a reverse fold is a bit more three dimensional than the other folds you ve made so far in order to make the reverse fold take the crease you just made and crease it in the opposite direction but make the crease by folding and tucking the corner into the paper 10 x research source since reverse folds can be hard to visualize as written instructions you can find the exact fold in question here https www youtube com watch v ihqmzluqmmg t 80 fold the top half over with the reverse fold out of the way you want to take the corner pointing right just the top layer not both layers and fold it back on itself fold it so that the flat side just above the corner lines up flush with the flat vertical line on the left side of the paper 11 x research source make a crease here but do not unfold the flap leave it folded turn the page over and make the same fold on the other side you now want to turn the paper over completely and make the same fold you just made but from the other side in other words fold the other corner the bottom layer from the previous step over so that its upper edge is also flush with the same flat side of the page 12 x research source especially if you re using a two colored sheet of paper this step will make more sense because the form of the penguin will start to become more apparent as the black side of the page will face outward on both sides as the project continues to take shape these will be the wings turn the paper over again to prepare for the next major fold you will need to turn the whole paper over again when you do you want to orient the paper so that the really narrow point is pointing upward 13 x research source fold the narrow point over to the left with the paper oriented so that the long narrow point face up take that point and fold it over at a 45 angle so that the point now points to the left 14 x research source you ll see how this fold starts to take shape as the penguin s beak after making the crease in this fold return the point to the upward position reverse fold along the crease you just made this step requires you to make an outside reverse fold along the crease you made in the last step an outside reverse fold is slightly different from the earlier reverse fold to make the fold unfold the paper along the black side slightly and poke your finger from the white side at the fold you made in the last step when the creases reverse direction simply reform the fold so that the two black sides of the sheet are in contact again 15 x research source once again reverse folds can be a bit difficult to describe you can find the exact movement at https www youtube com watch v ihqmzluqmmg t 127 fold the wing over though clearly visible now the wings won t quite look perfect yet take the wing on the side facing up and fold it over so that the white side faces out you ll fold it back so that the corner which was facing the bottom left now points to the right pull it back far enough so that it s just shy of where the little tail is at the bottom of the paper 16 x research source fold the wing back over on itself once you ve made the crease from the previous step fold the wing back over on itself so that the black side is once again facing up fold it so that the tip of the corner is just shy of touching the horizontal white edge at the bottom of the body 17 x research source makes a rabbit s ear fold to make the rabbit s ear fold lift the portion of the wing you just folder and reverse the crease from the last step but only at the bottom of the crease and only at the depth of roughly the tip of your finger this will makes the bottom tip of the wing into a little flap though the flat edge will still be parallel to the rest of the wing 18 x research source as with the other complex folds a visual can help which you will find here https www youtube com watch v ihqmzluqmmg t 156 repeat steps 14 16 for the other wing with one wing complete you re ready to turn the page over and repeat the same steps to form the other wing simply use the same folds from steps 14 16 but on the other side 19 x research source tuck in the points at the bottom the bottom of the penguin will still have points sticking out in a slightly misshapen way fold each of these points toward the inside of the penguin to make a flat horizontal bottom to the body 20 x research source once you tuck these flaps up you have your penguin get one white one black and one orange sheet of construction paper since origami can be a bit difficult and not very exciting for younger children the good old method of cutting and gluing construction paper might be more up their alley this method of making a paper penguin calls for one white one black and one orange sheet of construction paper 21 x research source trace an oval shape onto the black construction paper to form the body of the penguin have the child draw an oblong oval on the black construction paper with either a white crayon or a piece of chalk so that they can see the outline 22 x research source one fun and silly way to help the child make the shape is to have him or her place their shoe on the sheet and trace the outline of it 23 x research source cut out the black oval using a pair of scissors safety scissors for younger children have the child cut out the black oval from the construction paper when it comes to the eyes later you can have the child either draw them on the white paper or cut pupils out of the black paper for the latter you can have the child cut those out now as well trace a smaller oval onto the white construction paper you can now have the child trace the white portion of the belly on the white construction paper 24 x research source you can find something of the relative oblong shape to let the child trace it again or simply allow them to do it freehand glue the belly to the rest of the body once the child is done tracing the white oval allow them to cut the shape out of the construction paper then use a glue stick to glue the tummy portion to the rest of the body glue it closer to the bottom of the body portion than the middle since the head should be above it 25 x research source cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper to make the beak for the penguin have the child cut a small triangle out of the orange construction paper 26 x research source the beak doesn t have to be an exact triangle so you can have the child trace it first or simply cut one out for very small children the size of the beak might be too difficult for them to cut out so you may have to help with this step glue the beak to the penguin s face you have two different options to glue the beak to the penguin s face you can either glue the triangle flat with one of the points facing downward or you can actually make a little fold on one of the flat sides and glue it at the tab which will make the beak stick out from the penguin s face make the penguin s eyes as mentioned earlier you can have the child draw eyes on the white construction paper cut them out and glue those to the penguin or you can also have the child cut the whites of the eyes from the white construction paper then use the black construction paper to cut out the pupils a third option if the child is too young to cut out such small circles is to have some googly eyes on hand from a craft store or the craft section of a big box store young kids may have an easier time using a glue stick to attach google eyes instead 27 x research source let the child customize it this makes an easy basic shape for the penguin and then the child can have fun customizing it if the child cuts out two really flattened ovals from the black paper he or she can glue them to the side of the body as wings if the child wants to make feet for the penguin you can have them trace a leaf or something else with the slight contours to give them the webbed shape,Pets-and-Animals
how to paint a row of bird houses in watercolor,bird houses can be as plain or as ornate as houses for people but as a subject for an art work they are a lot less intimidating while we enjoy seeing and thinking about homes for birds we might live where it is impractical to install an actual bird house the solution is to paint a picture of bird houses because of its simplicity this project is virtually fail proof even for a non artist so go ahead tackle architecture but begin on a bird s scale,cut a rectangle of 140 lb cold pressed watercolor paper and draw a pencil line 2 5cm up from the bottom edge to create a base for the houses to stand on later you can paint this to represent a limb of a tree or a platform draw a simple house starting with a square 3½ in 10cm on a side in pencil to represent the body of the house to construct a slanted roof the center point 1¾ 5cm and draw a line upward a few inches close the roof by dropping two lines from the center point to each side of the house alternatively trace a miniature wooden birdhouse purchased from the craft or discount store simply place the house on your paper back down and draw around it in pencil repeat drawing houses until you have four in a row allow a slight space between them arrange them according to your taste varying sizes and shapes add details to each house such as entry holes for the birds a picket fence shingles siding or anything you wish go to the internet to look for ideas embellish the houses with vines flowers leafs beds berries tree branches etc use the vines as a device to intertwine and connect the houses and it will lead the viewer s eye through the composition put a bird or two in the picture draw one from your imagination or go online for pictures of birds put them standing still or in motion flying into the picture prepare your watercolors by adding water to each pad if you are using pan paints if you are using tube paints set up your palette with primary secondary and neutral colors remember to leave the center part of the palette open for mixing colors set out brushes a ½ 1cm flat for big areas and some pointed ones in various sizes begin painting by pulling a color for the body of the house diluting it with clear water and making a puddle large enough to cover the area you wish to fill repeat the process with a different color for each house paint the houses the area beneath the houses and the sky allow the paper to dry before attempting to paint over it or the colors will run into one another use a hairdryer to hasten the process if desired when dry paint the greenery flowers birds sun and any other touches you can think of,Pets-and-Animals

how to make furry cat ears,cat ears are cute accessories that can be easily made you can wear them with a costume or as a fun accessory with an outfit all of the materials needed to make the cat ears can be found at most arts and crafts stores to make furry cat ears create the ear bases put the ears together and complete the cat ears with the help of an elastic band and hot glue,draw the cat ears on paper this will be the template for the wire basically you just need to draw two wide triangles you might like to try drawing a few different sizes to see which size looks best on your head you can cut out the template or leave the cat ears drawn on the paper keep this design as your template for the remaining steps 1 x research source keep in mind that the template will be slightly smaller than the finished ears because of the fur a template of about three inches is a good size to use it doesn t matter what you use to draw the ears but pencil is good to use if you will be redrawing the ears multiple times create the cat ears with jewelry wire following the paper template bend the wire into the shape of the cat ears jewelry wire should be fairly easy to bend but you can use a pair of long nose pliers to help form the shape do this for both ears and you should end up with two triangle shaped ears if you don t have wire you can use paperclips just straighten them out and use them as wire don t worry if they don t make a perfect triangle it won t matter when you put them in the fur use glue to bind the sides until you put them in use a jewelry wire that is thicker so that it won t fall out of shape when fur is added to them 16 or 18 gauge is a good choice because it is thick but can be bent without too much effort by using pliers cut out the fake fur following the paper templates again cut out four triangle shapes in fur you can use any type of fur that appeals to you like black leopard print or lion like fur fur can be purchased at an arts and crafts store these should be about a half an inch larger than the template though as the fur needs to hold the wire triangles inside once stitched up 2 x research source remember that you can always make it smaller if it s too big but you can t make it bigger if it s too small sew the fur together place two fur pieces together the fur sides should be facing each other sew each side but leave the bottom edge unsewn that is the part you are going to insert the wire through to shape the ears the finished product should be inside out repeat this step until you have two ears 3 x research source there should be very little seam allowance only about an ¼ of a inch use a color of thread that best matches the color of fur flip the ears so that you can see the fur the ears should be inside out with the fur parts facing each other once you have finished sewing now turn the ears so that the fur is on the outside the ear shape should be really obvious now inspect the ears to make sure that there aren t any holes or mistakes 4 x research source turn the ears inside out and sew up any holes that you find use a pair of sewing scissors to cut the thread where any mistakes have been made remove the thread from that part and sew it back up with new thread place the wire triangle pieces inside each ear insert the wire you shaped into triangles earlier into the furry ears the wire should be able to fit snugly inside of the fur without too much or too little room adjust the wire if necessary sew up the bottom of the ears once you have inserted the wires into the furry ears sew up the bottom portion that is still open there shouldn t be any opening on the ears when you have finished sewing it doesn t matter if this sewing line is messy as nobody is going to see it create the band for the ears measure the elastic band or ribbon around your head the ribbon should cross over the top of your head rather than your forehead you can find a band or ribbon at most arts and crafts stores sew or hot glue the ends together to form a circular headband that fits your head if you re using a ribbon you can also choose to tie the ribbon in the back so that it is adjustable 5 x research source if sewing include a seam allowance in your measurements before cutting the ribbon tie the ribbon when testing it on your head to see how much ribbon will be needed in total you can also choose to use a headband instead of an elastic band or ribbon mark the placement for the ears first hold the band and ears together to see where the ears look most natural then check in the mirror to see where the ears look best making marks on the headband while it is on your head use a pen or marker to make marks where the ears will be covering it may be easier to have someone help you make the marks while the band is on your head attach the ears to the headband use hot glue to attach the cat ears onto the headband in the positions that you marked use just enough so that the ears stay up but don t use so much that the glue gets on other places on the headband or ribbon allow at least ten minutes for the glue to dry 6 x research source have someone help you with the hot glue if you aren t comfortable with using it on your own check the finished product once the glue has dried try on the ears the band should fit your head without sliding the ears should be standing straight up make any adjustments as needed 7 x

how to make polymer clay cats,creating these fun creatures is not difficult and will start your own sculptured collection they are great to give as gifts or just to add them to your shelf containing other precious art pieces,start by kneading the clay into a ball squish and roll it and warm it until is a soft pliable consistency make it spherical and work it from there pull out the various appendages four more or less equal legs a longer tail and a fatter head give the head a couple of ears and it should already be starting to look a little bit like a cat keep sculpting until it s a plausible cat shape it might even have some personality if so you might like to go with it keep making the tail more tail like keep making the head more cat like and hopefully a personality will emerge whether through design or of its own accord roll out a sausage of glow in the dark clay for the eyes it s easier to divide a sausage evenly surprise cat eyes glowing in the dark are amusing but use your own personal preference split the sausage into two equal parts and roll them into balls work carefully on the eyes as they are the single most important part of almost any critter every little change or move can change the look for example unevenly sized eyeballs give an air of derangement so take care when working with them but be prepared for them to surprise you attach the balls to the front of the head and presto you now have a cat that can stare at people split a very small black sausage of clay in half and roll up the pieces to make the pupils attach them to the eyes this is one of the most delicate parts of the whole process because the amount of clay involved is so tiny and black you may need to use a sculpting tool or a blunt knife to attach them to the eyeballs give the cat eyelids optional you can give the cat upper and lower lids or stick with just upper lids make them from a semi circle of clay created by forming a ball then squashing and halving it shape the lids into rough semicircles and carefully affix them at a precise angle the way that the lids are attached can easily make the difference between a critter which is sweetly looking for affection and one which is brimming over with malevolence take care in attaching them carefully concentrate on the details of its body language make the cat look the way your imagination and artistic nature take you a tail is a beautifully expressive thing for instance when a cat is mad it is moving slowly the set of a cat s ears and the angle of its head can tell you a great deal the way it is standing is crucial take care to make the texture of the piece as smooth as you want it with gentle rubbing and correct any minor flaws then place it on a baking tray laying it on its side or supporting it around the middle because unbaked polymer clay legs are flimsy and become softer while being baked place the tray in an oven preheated to 130 c 265 f and bake for 20 30 minutes according to the instructions that come with the clay finished to make a ball cat you need to have one main colour use this to make 2 big balls then chop the smaller one into sixths make four of them balls again the other 2 should be slightly triangular put them on the intact ball now you have the ears put the four balls on the other side of them make it look like a cat car with no windows next make a fat sausage for the tail if you want it to look bushy and more like an original ball cat if not then do a tail like a thin worm put it on and make sure that it is smoothed on now we need to do the eyes make two small white ovals and squish them on ts head they should get bigger make black circles very small squish them on voila you re done bake it on a tray and follow the instructions on the packet that the clay came in try to use the same clay for your products as the different clay may need to be baked at different times and temperatures,Pets-and-Animals

should have a triangle on each side with the points hanging over the edge in the middle you ll have a large triangle with a smaller triangle inside it flip the paper over to see your cat and draw a face when you flip it over turn the paper so the pointed parts you folded over the edge are at the top making the ears draw on eyes a nose mouth and whiskers and your paper kitty is done 5 x research source flatten out and paint the plate use your fingers to stretch out the edge of the paper plate as much as possible paint the back side of the plate the color you want your cat to be black works well for a scary halloween cat 6 x research source you can use acrylic paint tempura paint or even finger paint apply it with a sponge brush sponge or large paintbrush trace and cut out a large circle on one edge of the plate use a food container top or another large circle you have the circle should take up about 50 of the larger circle trace it close to one edge on the non painted side then cut out the circle and that edge together 7 x research source you can also use a compass to trace the circle you want the larger circle to end up looking like a crescent moon with pointed ends outline a smaller circle on the head piece for cutting out the head tail and ears the head piece is the smaller circle you snipped out of the original plate using a container lid trace a smaller circle onto the back of this piece in the smooth part of the plate and snip around it leave the wrinkled edge for the tail from the strip you have left cut out 2 small triangles for ears and a curved piece for the tail 8 x research source tape the head and tail on the crescent flip the crescent shape so the points are downward forming the legs turn it to the non painted side tape or glue the smaller circle on one side of the arch near the top place it slightly behind the big circle arrange the tail arching away from the crescent on the other end and tape or glue it into place 9 x research source the painted sides should all be facing front glue or tape the ears eyes nose and whiskers on the cat s face glue the ears you cut out on the back of the cat s head with the painted side facing forward cut out small strips for the whiskers and glue them into place for the eyes and nose you can cut out pieces of paper in other colors or use googly eyes and a pompom for the nose 10 x research source for a cat nose cut a little triangle out of pink paper for eyes cut eye shapes then draw in slits in the middle slice a piece of 11 by 8 5 inches 28 by 22 cm cardstock in half create 2 rectangles each one will be 5 5 by 8 5 inches 14 by 22 cm you ll use one half for the body of the cat and one half for the head and tail 11 x research source this can be any color you want try black for halloween or a white cat for winter start the body by folding 1 piece of the cardstock in half find the middle of the long edge on one of the smaller pieces of cardstock you just cut fold it over to make this long edge half the size make sure the edges meet 12 x research source for another type of body cut out a wide triangle with a curved edge pull the sides of the triangle together to overlap making a cone glue the edges together you can cut out small strips of paper for feet at the bottom 13 x research source finish the body by cutting out a half circle on the folded rectangle find the new long edge that s not the folded edge come in about 1 inch 2 5 cm on this edge and cut a half circle that reaches to about 1 inch 2 5 cm from the other side 14 x research source this makes the body and the legs the top of the half circle is the body and the parts that come down are the legs unfold the rectangle slightly to make an a shape on the bottom of each leg bend out a small square that s about 0 25 inches 0 64 cm long fold it at a 90 degree angle to make feet glue the body onto a small piece of cardstock use a half sheet of cardstock though pick a different color from the cat add glue to the bottom of the cat s feet and press them onto the cardstock as you glue the body make an a shape with it using the feet as the bottom of the a hold the feet in place for a few seconds until the glue starts to set 15 x research source if you used the cone shaped body you don t need to glue it to anything as it is sturdy enough as it is slice a tail off of the second piece of cardstock you cut in the beginning cut about 1 inch 2 5 cm of cardstock off one of the short ends leaving a rectangle that s about 7 5 by 5 5 inches 19 by 14 cm cut off the corners of the strip so that the tail is pointed at both of the short ends 16 x research source you could cut out a curvy tail instead if you prefer 17 x research source cut the head out of the rest of the second piece of cardstock fold the piece of paper so that you half the long side on the long non folded edge make the cat s chin by curving the corners with scissors unfold the rectangle for a moment and start cutting halfway up the bottom rectangle as you do angle the cut in about 1 inch 2 5 cm and stop at the crease in the middle fold the rectangle back and the cuts you just made will pop up for the ears 18 x research source run your fingernail along the crease at the top to make sure the cat s face stays folded create the eyes and whiskers by cutting them out of paper for the eyes cut out 2 eye shapes from a contrasting color yellow goes well with black draw in a slit on each eye with a marker using the scraps of paper from your cat s main color cut out small strips of paper for the whiskers glue the eyes and whiskers in place on the cat s face 19 x research source add the tail and face to the cat s body by cutting slots for them to slide into along the top of the fold on the cat s body cut a small slit going downward on either end of the body about 1 inch 2 5 cm from the ends slide the back rectangle of the cat s face into one end facing away from the body slide one end of the tail into the back slit 20 x research

how to make a clay cat,creating clay animals is so much fun and makes a perfect hobby or training exercise for budding artists you can use clay to make any animal or object you can think of or imagine but this article focuses on a clay cat,gather clay tools and some big black beads get the clay colors that speak to you when you envision the cat good choices might be brown black pink red and yellow clay you will add interest by creating details with tools such as forks plastic knives garlic pressers whatever your imagination brings forward the varied textures and colors will make your creature eye catching start by rolling out a big piece of brown clay and forming it this will be the body roll the brown clay in a big ball then squeeze the top sides a little to create an egg shaped body to add more detail to the belly flatten a piece of pink clay into an egg shape a bit smaller than the body then stick it on body for the stomach roll a ball of brown clay for the head use something to keep it in place such as a toothpick when you stick it on top of the body make cheeks by flattening two small balls put them next to each other on the bottom of the head not all the way at the bottom add a very small ball under the cheeks in the middle add the nose on top of the cheeks in the middle add eyes using the black beads you don t really need to make a mouth though because the snout forms the mouth make small triangular shaped ears and poke a small hole in them not all the way through put some pink clay inside the holes and stick the ears on top of the head drag a toothpick on the sides of the snout to make whiskers you can also stick in string to make whiskers make front legs bend a little at the front to make paws add claws by pushing a line down on each paw with a toothpick three times stick them on the front of the clay cat do the same method with the legs but stick them in the back add pads on the arms and legs to add more detail but you don t have to if you don t want to add a tail on the back at the bottom finished,Pets-and-Animals
how to make polymer clay cats,creating these fun creatures is not difficult and will start your own sculptured collection they are great to give as gifts or just to add them to your shelf containing other precious art pieces,start by kneading the clay into a ball squish and roll it and warm it until is a soft pliable consistency make it spherical and work it from there pull out the various appendages four more or less equal legs a longer tail and a fatter head give the head a couple of ears and it should already be starting to look a little bit like a cat keep sculpting until it s a plausible cat shape it might even have some personality if so you might like to go with it keep making the tail more tail like keep making the head more cat like and hopefully a personality will emerge whether through design or of its own accord roll out a sausage of glow in the dark clay for the eyes it s easier to divide a sausage evenly surprise cat eyes glowing in the dark are amusing but use your own personal preference split the sausage into two equal parts and roll them into balls work carefully on the eyes as they are the single most important part of almost any critter every little change or move can change the look for example unevenly sized eyeballs give an air of derangement so take care when working with them but be prepared for them to surprise you attach the balls to the front of the head and presto you now have a cat that can stare at people split a very small black sausage of clay in half and roll up the pieces to make the pupils attach them to the eyes this is one of the most delicate parts of the whole process because the amount of clay involved is so tiny and black you may need to use a sculpting tool or a blunt knife to attach them to the eyeballs give the cat eyelids optional you can give the cat upper and lower lids or stick with just upper lids make them from a semi circle of clay created by forming a ball then squashing and halving it shape the lids into rough semicircles and carefully affix them at a precise angle the way that the lids are attached can easily make the difference between a critter which is sweetly looking for affection and one which is brimming over with malevolence take care in attaching them carefully concentrate on the details of its body language make the cat look the way your imagination and artistic nature take you a tail is a beautifully expressive thing for instance when a cat is mad it is moving slowly the set of a cat s ears and the angle of its head can tell you a great deal the way it is standing is crucial take care to make the texture of the piece as smooth as you want it with gentle rubbing and correct any minor flaws then place it on a baking tray laying it on its side or supporting it around the middle because unbaked polymer clay legs are flimsy and become softer while being baked place the tray in an oven preheated to 130 c 265 f and bake for 20 30 minutes according to the instructions that come with the clay finished to make a ball cat you need to have one main colour use this to make 2 big balls then chop the smaller one into sixths make four of them balls again the other 2 should be slightly triangular put them on the intact ball now you have the ears put the four balls on the other side of them make it look like a cat car with no windows next make a fat sausage for the tail if you want it to look bushy and more like an original ball cat if not then do a tail like a thin worm put it on and make sure that it is smoothed on now we need to do the eyes make two small white ovals and squish them on ts head they should get bigger make black circles very small squish them on voila you re done bake it on a tray and follow the instructions on the packet that the clay came in try to use the same clay for your products as the different clay may need to be baked at different times and temperatures,Pets-and-Animals

how to make a clay dragon,dragons never seem to go out of fashion there is something captivating in these majestic mythical creatures that intrigues children and adults alike dragons take on many shapes sizes and portrayals depending on mythological background and storyteller preference these options open up endless possibilities to you as an artist all you need is some polymer clay add to that a little imagination and some clay working tips and your clay dragon will soon be ready for display,gather your materials of course to form your clay dragon you ll need clay but there are many options to choose from for the purposes of sculpting an amateur mini dragon you might consider using sculpey souffle or premo polymer clay 1 x research source 2 x research source if you plan on giving your dragon some color or highlighting its features like it s eyes and wings you ll also want a spray paint primer and some paint for your hardened clay 3 x research source acrylic paints are recommended by many clay artists for painting baked polymer clay 4 x research source aluminum knitting needles are also useful tools for styling and adding details to your clay dragon finer needles can be used for finer detail designs like the features of your dragon s face 5 x research source activate your clay fresh from the packaging your clay might seem stiff and difficult to mold to limber your clay and ready it for sculpting you ll want to tear it into pieces and knead it in your hands your hands will warm your clay softening it and making it easier to work with sculpting clay is intended to be worked with in this fashion the size of the dragon you intend to make will determine how much clay you use however a surprisingly small amount of clay goes a long way and you can always add more clay if necessary roll some clay into a single ball the warmed clay should shape more easily now that you ve finished activating it smooth out the surface of your clay ball and create a general sphere shape with it form the limbs of your dragon from your central ball of clay you are going to pull out your dragon s limbs do this by pinching out four legs at regular intervals without separating it from your clay ball 6 x research source flatten the limbs and bottom of your ball to create a solid base thick legs will create a more solid shape and will prevent your dragon s limbs from breaking free of its body feel free to adjust limbs as needed for example you may need to push the legs a little more closely together or pull more clay from your clay ball to give the limbs stability model the neck and head pull some clay from your limbed clay ball forward for the neck and head of your dragon 7 x research source make sure the base of your dragon s neck is thick enough to support the head and the length of the neck a stout short neck can be easier to accomplish for beginner level sculptors at the end of your neck you can fold down the end of the clay to form a head dragons typically have serpentine features so the head of your dragon will likely be triangular in shape ending in a point add a tail tease some clay from your central ball to the back to create a tail a thick base connecting your tail to its body will create sturdiness in the finished product avoid making your tail too long as this can crack during backing or harden in a way that is brittle and delicate 8 x research source 9 x research source push down slightly on the base of your tail to give the effect that the tail is coming out from between the dragon s legs and not from the top of your clay ball which will eventually turn into the back of your dragon create wings for your dragon wings can be tricky and while learning the basics of sculpting you may want to keep your wings thick and small 10 x research source create your wings by pulling some clay from either side of the top of your clay ball if you find that you need more clay knead a small piece and use your thumb to blend the new clay with that of your clay ball and then work this clay into the simple shape of a wing on both sides thick wings will keep the clay from cracking there when you bake it and will result in a sturdier sculpture the wings being such a delicate part of the sculpture are the most fragile and breakable part of the dragon exercise care while forming these shape and affix your horns if desired your dragon may be a hornless variety but if you had planned on making a horned dragon take a small amount of surplus clay and knead it in your hands then shape two cones for your horns and lightly press each into the head of your dragon use a little water to dampen the base of your cones this can help keep your horns in place 11 x research source elongate the body of the dragon if necessary it s likely that your clay ball is still mostly round at this point with limbs head tail wings and horns attached however the bodies of dragons are usually more elongated and oval in shape press gently on the rounded sides of your clay ball to squish the circular shape into a longer oval one 12 x research source detail the body 13 x research source at this stage your dragon should be mostly formed but you should consider using a little extra clay and your knitting needles to add a ridge along the back of your dragon this can be done by kneading some extra clay pulling off little pieces rolling tiny cones damping the base of the cones and pressing the cones along the spine of the dragon adding a contour line with your knitting needles to either side of the spine give features to your wings dragons in most mythologies have bat like wings these often come to a point at the highest point and have some bones dividing the wings into parts or sections using your finest knitting needle you should carefully trace a line along the inside of the outer boundary of your wing add lines from the top of the wing to the bottom of the wing splitting each into regular sections avoid thinning your wings too much or applying too much pressure thin clay cracks easily when baked or after being baked and even well formed wings will be delicate 14 x research source 15 x research source give your dragon a face the small size of this amateur model will limit the amount of detail you are adding unless you have a very steady hand and very precise needles 16 x research source however you should be able to use your knitting needles to gently carve out the shape of two eyes and a mouth line around the outer rim of your triangular head fire your dragon firing refers to the process of heating clay until it sets permanently in the shape it is formed this is usually done in a kiln but your polymer clay can be baked in your oven check the temperature at which your clay should be baked as listed on the label or instructions your clay came with pre heat your oven first putting your clay in the oven before it is at the target heat can have a negative impact on the firing process watch the dragon while it is baking the wings legs tail and sometimes the head can burn this is especially important if you re not going to paint the dragon as the burning will be visible set a timer and wait for baking to finish the length of time you should bake your dragon at should also be indicated on the label or instructions that came with your clay set a timer so you don t forget to remove your dragon baking it too long can cause it to crack while you are waiting for your dragon to bake you might put away your remaining clay according to the storage directions on its packaging clean and put away your knitting needles prepare your primer painting area and painting supplies prime the body of your dragon white is a great priming color it offers a solid base that is high contrast making it easy for you to see where you have already painted and where you have yet to paint primer will also help preserve your acrylic paint clay can be very porous and may absorb a lot of paint without primer 17 x research source paint the body of your dragon if this is your first dragon you might want to choose a single bold color this will help you get a feel for how the paint and clay interact how quickly it dries where it collects clumps and trouble areas as well after you have painted your solid base allow your paint to dry fully paint contour and contrast lines look at your dragon from various angles where you notice naturally occurring shadows and contours you can add a thin line in black to give sharper contrast a little black on the downward facing areas of your dragon will give the

make a long log shape you can continue rolling until the snake is as thin or thick as you d like 1 x research source go as quickly or slowly as you like depending on how closely you want to monitor your clay log s length be careful not to make your clay log too thin as it will progressively get more delicate the thinner it gets flatten one end of the snake for a head poke two holes into the head with a toothpick for eyes or add a pair of small googly eyes you can also roll two tiny clay balls between your finger and your thumb and attach them for eyes if you have neither a toothpick nor googly eyes available 2 x research source make a tiny clay tongue for a tongue grab a piece of red or pink clay and place it between your finger and thumb roll it into a log shape much like how you rolled your snake but on a smaller scale split your log in two at one end to create a forked tongue and attach it to the end of your snake s mouth 3 x research source add patterns to its skin like polka dots or stripes for polka dots flatten tiny clay balls with your finger and thumb and attach them to your snakes body you can make stripes by rolling tiny clay logs and spacing them across the length of your snake 4 x research source choose two different colors of clay choose colors that stand out next to each other and do not clash red and pink for example might not be a great idea red and orange though can make a pleasant sunset like effect complementary colors or colors opposite from each other on the color wheel look especially bright when next to each other 5 x research source roll one color into a log this will be your snail s shell continue rolling the clay until it is long and thin make the log as long as possible to make a shell with a detailed spiral stop rolling when the log is thin enough to fold in on itself but thick enough that it won t break apart 6 x research source you might have to try a few times before you find the right thickness for your shell fold the log in on itself once you ve achieved a good length for your shell fold the log into a spiral start at one end of the clay which will become the middle of your spiral and keep folding until your clay shape resembles a cinnamon roll set the spiral aside after you finish so you can attach it to the body later 7 x research source roll a small log to be the snail s body this will be your snail s body so make it thicker and shorter than your snail shell after you re done rolling attach the snail s shell into the back of its body all you have left to add now are facial details add antennae and a face roll two small logs for the antennae and attach them to the top of your snail s body then poke two holes with your toothpick for the eyes or add two small googly eyes for a mouth roll another small log and curve it into a smile attach it below the snail s eyes 8 x research source start with a thick oval shaped ball this will be your dog s body you can make it out of a normal color for a dog like brown black or white or you can use vibrant colors like violet aquamarine or pink lay the oval down horizontally and prepare to add the dog s head and four legs you can make the body a little longer to make a dachshund type dog also known as a wiener dog 9 x research source if you d like to make a dalmatian use white for your dog s body and add flattened ovals for spots 10 x research source make a round ball for the head attach it to the top of your dog s body press it in until the head sticks form two triangles or long ovals from the clay and attach it to the top of your dog s head for ears add eyes and a smile and top off your dog s face with a round oval for a nose 11 x research source place a flattened red or pink half circle on your dog s mouth for a floppy tongue add four rectangles for the legs for legs shape four rectangles out of the clay place the legs onto the dog in pairs two go in the front of the body and two in the back scratch in two or three lines at the bottom of the legs for paws 12 x research source attach a tail to your dog s body roll a small piece of clay back and forth between your hands much like how you made the snake continue rolling until the tail gets to the desired length attach the tail to the back end of your dog s body 13 x research source roll an oval for the body for a bird body the oval should be long and oblong make the bottom end of the oval larger than the top end place the oval upright and prepare to add the bird s head 14 x research source make a sphere for the bird s head attach the head to the top of the oval and press down until it sticks stick on or poke in two eyes for your bird for a beak roll an orange or yellow ball between your finger and thumb use the toothpick to draw a slit lengthwise on the ball press the back end of the ball onto your bird s head 15 x research source stretch the top and bottom ends of the beak into points for a less cartoonish beak add wings to your bird form two ovals out of your clay and flatten them until they are two dimensional place one wing on either side of your bird s body if desired you can use the toothpick to draw designs like feather prints on your wings 16 x research source for a two colored wing form two teardrop shapes out of clay and flatten it until it is also two dimensional place one on each of your bird wings sculpt two bird feet feet on clay

how to make polymer clay cats,creating these fun creatures is not difficult and will start your own sculptured collection they are great to give as gifts or just to add them to your shelf containing other precious art pieces,start by kneading the clay into a ball squish and roll it and warm it until is a soft pliable consistency make it spherical and work it from there pull out the various appendages four more or less equal legs a longer tail and a fatter head give the head a couple of ears and it should already be starting to look a little bit like a cat keep sculpting until it s a plausible cat shape it might even have some personality if so you might like to go with it keep making the tail more tail like keep making the head more cat like and hopefully a personality will emerge whether through design or of its own accord roll out a sausage of glow in the dark clay for the eyes it s easier to divide a sausage evenly surprise cat eyes glowing in the dark are amusing but use your own personal preference split the sausage into two equal parts and roll them into balls work carefully on the eyes as they are the single most important part of almost any critter every little change or move can change the look for example unevenly sized eyeballs give an air of derangement so take care when working with them but be prepared for them to surprise you attach the balls to the front of the head and presto you now have a cat that can stare at people split a very small black sausage of clay in half and roll up the pieces to make the pupils attach them to the eyes this is one of the most delicate parts of the whole process because the amount of clay involved is so tiny and black you may need to use a sculpting tool or a blunt knife to attach them to the eyeballs give the cat eyelids optional you can give the cat upper and lower lids or stick with just upper lids make them from a semi circle of clay created by forming a ball then squashing and halving it shape the lids into rough semicircles and carefully affix them at a precise angle the way that the lids are attached can easily make the difference between a critter which is sweetly looking for affection and one which is brimming over with malevolence take care in attaching them carefully concentrate on the details of its body language make the cat look the way your imagination and artistic nature take you a tail is a beautifully expressive thing for instance when a cat is mad it is moving slowly the set of a cat s ears and the angle of its head can tell you a great deal the way it is standing is crucial take care to make the texture of the piece as smooth as you want it with gentle rubbing and correct any minor flaws then place it on a baking tray laying it on its side or supporting it around the middle because unbaked polymer clay legs are flimsy and become softer while being baked place the tray in an oven preheated to 130 c 265 f and bake for 20 30 minutes according to the instructions that come with the clay finished to make a ball cat you need to have one main colour use this to make 2 big balls then chop the smaller one into sixths make four of them balls again the other 2 should be slightly triangular put them on the intact ball now you have the ears put the four balls on the other side of them make it look like a cat car with no windows next make a fat sausage for the tail if you want it to look bushy and more like an original ball cat if not then do a tail like a thin worm put it on and make sure that it is smoothed on now we need to do the eyes make two small white ovals and squish them on ts head they should get bigger make black circles very small squish them on voila you re done bake it on a tray and follow the instructions on the packet that the clay came in try to use the same clay for your products as the different clay may need to be baked at different times and temperatures,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a clay dog,making clay dogs is a fun activity especially for children creating and collecting clay dogs can be a fun hobby or you can make a clay dog as a special gift for a friend even if you have never tried to make animals out of clay you can pick up the basics in just a few minutes as you get better you can create more detailed and intricate clay dog designs,select your clay there are many different kinds of clay any of which can create a dog deciding which clay to use depends on your desired end result select your colors you may choose to purchase different colors of clay to create the dog or you can select to use one solid color and paint the dog after it is finished some clays like polymer can be baked into a finished piece very quickly in an oven if you don t have an oven to use for your clay you may prefer to select an air dry clay however you will have to wait four or five days to finish it if you are doing clay animation you will want to select an oil based clay that will not dry out 1 x research source break down the clay into manageable pieces instead of trying to mold a dog shape from a large chunk of clay break apart the clay into several smaller pieces keep one larger piece to create the torso of the dog break off a piece for the head make four pieces of equal size to create the legs roll the pieces into balls to try and keep the size as even as possible for each leg make one smaller piece for the tail set the remainder aside to use for other small shapes that remain such as the ears and eyes make the body form a cylindrical shape with the largest piece of clay roll some clay into a ball and shape it into a rectangle round the edges a little to make the rectangular body look like a dog body you may want to adjust the torso to be smaller or larger depending on the kind of dog you want to create for example a basset hound or dachshund will have a much longer body but much shorter limbs if you are making a large sculpture you may want to crumple up damp newspaper and mold the clay around it this will save you clay make the sculpture lighter and save you time when baking 2 x research source shape the head you can shape a single piece by forming a pointed snout at the front and rounding the back or you can shape a separate ball of clay for the snout and press it to the front of the face stick it on the top of the end of the body to keep the head in place you might want to insert a toothpick halfway into the body of the dog then place the head on the top half of the toothpick roll out four identical cylinder shapes for the legs flatten the bottoms and add pads with brown or black clay put two legs on the back of the dog and two legs on the front use the legs to help create the pose for your dog you might want to make him stand sit or lie down it is entirely up to you make a tail roll another piece of clay between your hands to create the tail you might want to make it long and pointy or short and stubby it depends entirely on the kind of dog you want to create attach the tail to the rear of the dog add some details you will want to have ears a snout mouth eyes and a nose you can use smaller pieces of clay to shape the pieces or use your modeling tools to carve some of them into the existing form the more time you take creating details the more lifelike your dog will be consider adding a tongue add a small piece of thin clay out the side of your dog s mouth try pressing two small lines into each paw to create some toes if you are using different colors of clay you can give your dogs some spots by adding small thin patches of different colors over the body or legs create a collar by forming a long flat strip and wrapping it around the neck of the dog heat the oven check the instructions for your polymer clay to find the right temperature and time for the type of clay and the size of your clay dog polymer clays will all cook at a temperature between 215 f 102 c to 325 f 163 c 3 x research source place the clay dog on a glass or ceramic tile wait until the oven reaches the desired temperature place the tile with the dog on it on the middle rack of your oven set a timer so you know when the time is up follow the cooking times suggested by the manufacturer for your type of clay the larger your clay dog is the longer it will take you to cook it in the oven 4 x research source use an oven thermometer certain ovens use rapid heating systems that can create dips and spikes in the temperature you should try to monitor the temperature in the oven to make sure your clay isn t getting too hot or not hot enough too cold and your clay may become brittle too hot and you may end up burning the clay 5 x research source remove the dog from the oven when the timer goes off take out your clay dog leave the dog to cool on the ceramic tile don t worry if the clay doesn t appear firm when you first remove it from the oven as the clay cools down it will harden use oven mitts when handling the tile it will be hot use acrylic paints you don t need to wash or sand your clay beforehand just brush on your base coat then add as much or little detail as you like select the colors that suit your type of dog you might use mainly brown and black for a rottweiler or white and black for a dalmatian avoid spray on paints as they contain a solvent that can degrade your clay let the paint dry it may take 15 20 minutes to dry from the time you finish painting brush on a coat of clear varnish use a different brush to apply the varnish this will give your clay dog a nice glossy finish the coat of varnish will seal in the paint and help protect it from chipping,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a clay dragon,dragons never seem to go out of fashion there is something captivating in these majestic mythical creatures that intrigues children and adults alike dragons take on many shapes sizes and portrayals depending on mythological background and storyteller preference these options open up endless possibilities to you as an artist all you need is some polymer clay add to that a little imagination and some clay working tips and your clay dragon will soon be ready for display,gather your materials of course to form your clay dragon you ll need clay but there are many options to choose from for the purposes of sculpting an amateur mini dragon you might consider using sculpey souffle or premo polymer clay 1 x research source 2 x research source if you plan on giving your dragon some color or highlighting its features like it s eyes and wings you ll also want a spray paint primer and some paint for your hardened clay 3 x research source acrylic paints are recommended by many clay artists for painting baked polymer clay 4 x research source aluminum knitting needles are also useful tools for styling and adding details to your clay dragon finer needles can be used for finer detail designs like the features of your dragon s face 5 x research source activate your clay fresh from the packaging your clay might seem stiff and difficult to mold to limber your clay and ready it for sculpting you ll want to tear it into pieces and knead it in your hands your hands will warm your clay softening it and making it easier to work with sculpting clay is intended to be worked with in this fashion the size of the dragon you intend to make will determine how much clay you use however a surprisingly small amount of clay goes a long way and you can always add more clay if necessary roll some clay into a single ball the warmed clay should shape more easily now that you ve finished activating it smooth out the surface of your clay ball and create a general sphere shape with it form the limbs of your dragon from your central ball of clay you are going to pull out your dragon s limbs do this by pinching out four legs at regular intervals without separating it from your clay ball 6 x research source flatten the limbs and bottom of your ball to create a solid base thick legs will create a more solid shape and will prevent your dragon s limbs from breaking free of its body feel free to adjust limbs as needed for example you may need to push the legs a little more closely together or pull more clay from your clay ball to give the limbs stability model the neck and head pull some clay from your limbed clay ball forward for the neck and head of your dragon 7 x research source make sure the base of your dragon s neck is thick enough to support the head and the length of the neck a stout short neck can be easier to accomplish for beginner level sculptors at the end of your neck you can fold down the end of the clay to form a head dragons typically have serpentine features so the head of your dragon will likely be triangular in shape ending in a point add a tail tease some clay from your central ball to the back to create a tail a thick base connecting your tail to its body will create sturdiness in the finished product avoid making your tail too long as this can crack during backing or harden in a way that is brittle and delicate 8 x research source 9 x research source push down slightly on the base of your tail to give the effect that the tail is coming out from between the dragon s legs and not from the top of your clay ball which will eventually turn into the back of your dragon create wings for your dragon wings can be tricky and while learning the basics of sculpting you may want to keep your wings thick and small 10 x research source create your wings by pulling some clay from either side of the top of your clay ball if you find that you need more clay knead a small piece and use your thumb to blend the new clay with that of your clay ball and then work this clay into the simple shape of a wing on both sides thick wings will keep the clay from cracking there when you bake it and will result in a sturdier sculpture the wings being such a delicate part of the sculpture are the most fragile and breakable part of the dragon exercise care while forming these shape and affix your horns if desired your dragon may be a hornless variety but if you had planned on making a horned dragon take a small amount of surplus clay and knead it in your hands then shape two cones for your horns and lightly press each into the head of your dragon use a little water to dampen the base of your cones this can help keep your horns in place 11 x research source elongate the body of the dragon if necessary it s likely that your clay ball is still mostly round at this point with limbs head tail wings and horns attached however the bodies of dragons are usually more elongated and oval in shape press gently on the rounded sides of your clay ball to squish the circular shape into a longer oval one 12 x research source detail the body 13 x research source at this stage your dragon should be mostly formed but you should consider using a little extra clay and your knitting needles to add a ridge along the back of your dragon this can be done by kneading some extra clay pulling off little pieces rolling tiny cones damping the base of the cones and pressing the cones along the spine of the dragon adding a contour line with your knitting needles to either side of the spine give features to your wings dragons in most mythologies have bat like wings these often come to a point at the highest point and have some bones dividing the wings into parts or sections using your finest knitting needle you should carefully trace a line along the inside of the outer boundary of your wing add lines from the top of the wing to the bottom of the wing splitting each into regular sections avoid thinning your wings too much or applying too much pressure thin clay cracks easily when baked or after being baked and even well formed wings will be delicate 14 x research source 15 x research source give your dragon a face the small size of this amateur model will limit the amount of detail you are adding unless you have a very steady hand and very precise needles 16 x research source however you should be able to use your knitting needles to gently carve out the shape of two eyes and a mouth line around the outer rim of your triangular head fire your dragon firing refers to the process of heating clay until it sets permanently in the shape it is formed this is usually done in a kiln but your polymer clay can be baked in your oven check the temperature at which your clay should be baked as listed on the label or instructions your clay came with pre heat your oven first putting your clay in the oven before it is at the target heat can have a negative impact on the firing process watch the dragon while it is baking the wings legs tail and sometimes the head can burn this is especially important if you re not going to paint the dragon as the burning will be visible set a timer and wait for baking to finish the length of time you should bake your dragon at should also be indicated on the label or instructions that came with your clay set a timer so you don t forget to remove your dragon baking it too long can cause it to crack while you are waiting for your dragon to bake you might put away your remaining clay according to the storage directions on its packaging clean and put away your knitting needles prepare your primer painting area and painting supplies prime the body of your dragon white is a great priming color it offers a solid base that is high contrast making it easy for you to see where you have already painted and where you have yet to paint primer will also help preserve your acrylic paint clay can be very porous and may absorb a lot of paint without primer 17 x research source paint the body of your dragon if this is your first dragon you might want to choose a single bold color this will help you get a feel for how the paint and clay interact how quickly it dries where it collects clumps and trouble areas as well after you have painted your solid base allow your paint to dry fully paint contour and contrast lines look at your dragon from various angles where you notice naturally occurring shadows and contours you can add a thin line in black to give sharper contrast a little black on the downward facing areas of your dragon will give the impression of shadow making your model look more realistic depending on how much or little contour contrast or shading you have added you may have to wait for the paint to dry before moving on paint the eyes and face of your dragon make these as detailed or as abstract as you d like you can leave white primer visible for the whites of your dragon s eyes and add a dot of black complete the eye but you could also glue googly eyes allow any wet paint to dry fully display your dragon proudly now that you ve sculpted fired and painted your very own dragon you should show it to your friends and get some pointers refine these basic methods and use them to make larger more intricate models,Pets-and-Animals

how to make a clay horse,crafting a clay horse is a great way to pay tribute the beloved animal and best of all you re left with your very own handmade figurine to play with or proudly display decide what kind of clay best suits your project and vision wear an apron and or clothes you don t mind getting dirty and get ready to sculpt,determine if the type of modeling clay is the best option for your project many modeling clays are oil based or wax based which means that they do not dry out in fact these clays can be exposed to air yet remain malleable for long periods of time allowing you both to move and reshape your creations at will and to preserve your pieces for long periods of time 1 x research source modeling clay is also sturdier than a material like play doh and typically holds its shape better making it easier to craft more detailed pieces 2 x research source note though that oil and wax based modeling clays cannot be hardened and painting these kinds of clay is not recommended 3 x research source if you would like to be able to paint on your clay horse polymer clay might work better for you prepare your work surface find a hard flat surface to work on oil based modeling clays can be messy and can leave greasy stains on uncovered work surfaces so depending on how clean you d like to keep that surface you may find it helpful to cover your workstation with newspaper wax paper or saran wrap decide how big you d like your sculpture to be based on what size of horse you d like to make your horse estimate how much clay you ll need if you are new to clay modeling you may want to avoid getting too overambitious with the scale of your horse instead start with a piece of clay that you can hold comfortably in one hand knead and warm your clay once you ve got the right amount of clay begin either squeezing it between your hands or place the clay on your work surface and knead it like bread dough continue squeezing or kneading until the clay is warm soft and easy to work with divide your clay into sections cut your clay into four pieces using a craft knife wire clay cutter or your hands one piece should be slightly larger than the the other three which should all be approximately the same size model the horse s neck and torso take your largest piece of clay and mold it into an oblong circle gently pinch one end of your oblong circle and pull it upwards to form your horse s neck since you ll want your horse s body to be able to support its head be sure not make the neck too long or too thin form your horse s head begin by mold one of your three equal sized clay pieces into a peanut shape next gently pinch one end of your peanut shape elongating it this will be your horse s nose and mouth create facial features using another one of your three equal sized sections craft two triangle shaped ears and two round eyes be sure to set aside some of this clay for your mane and tail though carefully attach your eyes and ears to the larger end of the horse s head finally attach your completed head to your horse s neck mold the horse s legs cut your third play doh section into four smaller pieces of equal size create long cylinder shaped legs by rolling each of these pieces between your fingers until they re a length and width that look proportionate in relation to your horse s torso the thickness and height of your legs will depend on whether or not you d like your horse to be able to stand upright thicker and shorter legs for instance will make for a sturdier base mold and attach your hooves break off a small piece of clay from one end of each cylinder to use for your hooves roll each hoof into a ball pinch each ball between your thumb and pointer finger making them into short cylinders attach one of these short cylinders to the bottom of each leg now attach two legs to front end of your horse s torso and two to the back end add a mane and tail break the last of your clay into smaller pieces and form these pieces into strands or chunks of hair to complete your horse attach your tail to the rear end of the horse s torso and your mane to the back of the horse s head and neck and between its ears decide if polymer clay is the material that best suits your project pieces made from polymer clay can be put in the oven to harden although you can also purchase air dry polymer clay making it a good choice if preserving your sculpture is important to you 4 x research source polymer clay can also be painted which is ideal if you are looking to create a more detailed clay model keep in mind that young children should never attempt to bake their polymer creations on their own adult supervision is always required when using an oven get your work surface ready find a hard flat surface to work on cover your work surface in newspaper if you are concerned with messiness figure out how much clay you ll need while the scale of your model is ultimately up to you remember that larger pieces will take longer to cure in the oven we suggest that you use an amount of clay that you can hold easily in the palm of one hand warm your clay to make your polymer clay as malleable as possible begin by squeezing it between your hands work your until the clay is warm soft and easy to work with you may also choose to place the clay on your work surface and knead it like bread dough separate your clay into four sections you can use your hands a craft knife or a wire clay cutter to divide your clay one of your four piece should be slightly larger than the rest and the remaining three sections should be of roughly equal size create your horse s neck and torso mold your largest piece of clay into an oblong circle now gently pinch one end of your oblong circle and pull it upwards to create a neck make sure the neck isn t too long or too thin if it is it won t be able to support your horse s head mold a head take one of your three equal sized clay pieces and turn it into a peanut shape next gently pinch one end of your peanut shape elongating it to make your horse s nose and mouth create and add eyes and ears using another one of your three equal sized sections create two triangle shaped ears and two round eyes but be sure to set aside some of this clay for your mane and tail carefully fasten the eyes and ears to the larger more round end of your horse s head now attach the head to your horse s neck mold legs for your horse cut your third play doh section into four smaller pieces of equal size roll each of these pieces between your fingers creating long cylinders legs until they re a length and width that you desire the thickness and height of your legs should reflect whether or not you d like your horse to be able to sturdily stand upright legs that are thicker and longer make for a sturdier base mold and attach your hooves break off a small piece of clay from one end of each leg to create your hooves roll each small piece into a ball pinch these balls between your thumb and pointer finger until they resemble short cylinders attach one of these short cylinders to the bottom of each leg now attach two legs to front end of your horse s torso and two to the back end use the last of your clay to make a mane and tail break the last of your clay into smaller pieces forming these pieces into strands or chunks of hair finish modeling your horse by attach your tail to the rear end of the horse s torso and your mane to the back of the horse s head and neck and between its ears you can omit the clay mane if you would prefer to paint one on after you ve cured your sculpture cure your polymer clay horse follow the packet instructions to ensure that you re baking your piece at the right temperature and for the correct amount of time temperatures used to cook polymer clay vary from 215 f 102 c to 325 f 163 c 5 x research source choose paints that are best suited for your polymer clay acrylic paint is generally recommended but if you first coat your piece with a glaze made for polymer clay e g sculpey glaze you may use almost any kind of paint 6 x research source again painting your horse is an entirely optional step decide what color or colors you d like to use for your horse many horses have spotted coats which can be fun and a little more challenging to paint than single colored coats remember too that while most horses found in nature are some shade of brown beige black or grey your artistic options are not as limited if pink is your favorite color and you would like your horse s coat or mane to be pink by all means go for it leave your painted piece to dry while many paints will dry in under half an hour you may want to wait a little longer if you d like to be on the safe side drying times may also vary depending on how thick a coat of paint you ve applied apply a coat of varnish coating your horse with a clear varnish will help ensure that the paint maintains a fresh look and doesn t chip 7 x research source be sure your paint has dried fully before you cover it with varnish and be sure that the brush you use for your varnish coat is clean decide if play doh is the best material for you play doh can be a great sculpting material particularly for younger artists but is not your best bet if you d like to create a more long lasting sculpture play doh is good for young sculptors because it is very soft and easy for small hands to mold play doh is also food safe making it a wise choice for curious toddlers who might try tasting their art supplies and is marketed as being safe for ages two and up 8 x research source unfortunately play doh will dry out and crack if left sitting out so be prepared for the fact that your piece may not remain intact or in good condition for long find a flat surface to work on while play doh is fairly easy to clean up covering your work station with newspaper can make the cleaning process easier 9 x research source determine the scale of your project decide how big you d like your horse to be and estimate much play doh you ll need accordingly in the interest of keeping your project manageable you may want to avoid getting too overambitious with the size of your model try starting with an amount of play doh that you can hold easily in one hand prepare your play doh to ensure that your play doh is as soft and easy to work with as possible squeeze it between your hands until it is warm if you are using old play doh that has begun to dry out try working a small amount of water into it to restore its pliability 10 x research source divide your play doh into sections using your hands break your play doh into four pieces making one piece slightly larger than the rest the other three pieces should be of roughly equal size model the horse s neck and torso take your largest piece of play doh and mold it into an oblong circle gently pinch one end of your oblong circle and pull it upwards to form your horse s neck since you ll want your horse s body to be able to support its head be sure not make the neck too long or too thin form your horse s head begin by mold one of your three equal sized clay pieces into a peanut shape gently pinch one end of your peanut shape elongating it to create the horse s nose and mouth create and attach facial features using another one of your three equal sized sections craft two triangle shaped ears and two round eyes but make sure to set aside some of this play doh section as you will need it later to make your mane and tail carefully attach your eyes and ears to the larger end of the horse s head and fasten your completed head to the horse s neck make the horse s legs divide your third play doh section into four smaller pieces of equal size roll each of these pieces between your fingers creating long cylinder shaped legs how thick you and short or how thin and tall you make your legs will depend on whether or not you d like your horse to be able to stand upright thicker and shorter legs will make for a sturdier base mold and attach your hooves break off a small piece of clay from one end of each cylinder to use for your hooves roll each hoof into a ball then pinch each ball between your thumb and pointer finger until they become short cylinders attach one of these short cylinders to the bottom of each leg then proceed to attach two legs to front end of your horse s torso and two to the back end add a mane and tail break the last of your play doh into smaller pieces and form these pieces into strands or chunks of hair attach your tail to the rear end of the horse s torso and your mane to the back of the horse s head and neck and between its ears allow your horse to dry and paint if desired play doh is an air drying clay so let your piece sit out until it hardens the drying process may take up to several days so have patience 11 x research source once your horse has dried you can add color and detail to your sculpture using either acrylic or poster paint this is optional 12 x research source bear in mind that even if you paint it your play doh horse is still likely to crack or crumble after some time as play doh is not intended to be long lasting 13 x research

how to make a peacock,peacocks are beautiful majestic creatures and they re so eye catching with their blue purple green and gold feathers it s no wonder we often want to recreate them when we make crafts make handprint peacocks with preschool age kids try making paper plate peacocks with grade school kids and add even more finesse to your crafting by making a paper fan peacock with older children chances are you already have most of the materials at home that you need to complete any of these projects so get crafting,trace your hand on a piece of construction paper and cut it out if you want to prepare the materials for this craft ahead of time trace your own hand on construction paper one for each peacock you plan to make if you re crafting with kids help them trace their own hands or let them do it themselves and carefully cut each hand out with a pair of scissors use green blue or purple paper to keep with the peacock color scheme 1 x research source supervise kids closely while they use scissors and consider getting child safe scissors for kids under 5 glue colored feathers onto the hand to create the peacock s feathers for each hand use anywhere from 10 to 15 feathers to create a plentiful beautiful spread for a traditional looking peacock use shades of blue green purple and yellow but if your goal is to just have fun choose whatever colors you like the best use a glue stick or white craft glue on the back of each feather press it down on the cut out hand and repeat until they re all attached 2 x research source you can buy packets of colorful feathers for crafting purposes from your local craft store really inexpensively glue the feathers down so that they fan out from the bottom of the hand and follow the spread of the fingers create the peacock s body on a popsicle stick by using paint paint one side of a popsicle stick either green blue or purple with washable tempura paint if you want a wider peacock glue several sticks together and paint them all the same color 3 x research source if you don t have popsicle sticks plastic or wooden spoons also work well attach googly eyes or draw eyes to make the peacock s face if you have googly eyes attach 2 of them near the top of the popsicle stick for the eyes and use a marker to make a sideways v to create the peacock s beak if you don t have googly eyes you can just draw them in place by making small black circles 4 x research source you could even draw some kind of design down the popsicle stick to make your craft even more unique you could make staggered rows of teardrop shapes and just make slanted lines all up and down to resemble feathers center the popsicle stick in the middle of the feathers and glue it down take the peacock s body and line up its bottom with the bottom of the hand cutout put glue on the back of the popsicle stick and press it down in the center of the feathers so that it sticks in place let your craft dry before hanging it up or playing with it 5 x research source this is a really easy craft to do with young kids it helps them work on their fine motor skills and their hand eye coordination cut a paper plate in half to create the backdrop for the feathers each peacock needs half of a paper plate so cut as many as you need for your craft white paper plates work best for this project as you won t have to worry about covering up any kind of decorative background 6 x research source you could even make a family of peacocks by using differently sized plates small ones could be baby peacocks and bigger ones could be adults add color to the plate with markers and paints this is the really fun part where you and your kids can get creative use markers and washable paints in shades of blue green purple and yellow cover the entire paper plate with color to create the background for your peacock 7 x research source you could even get messy and do some finger painting mix together different colors and use your hands to create strips of color on the paper plate you can be as organized or as abstract as you want embellish the plate with stickers glitter and feathers after your paint has dried go ahead and use other crafting materials like glitter stickers and feathers to make even more intricate feather designs use white craft glue to attach things like feather and gems to the plate 8 x research source you could also create a pattern all over the plate in white craft glue and then shake glitter over it to create a sparkly design for easy clean up of glitter do the craft over top of a baking sheet it should catch a lot of the excess glitter and when you re done crafting you can shake it off outdoors create the body of a peacock from a piece of construction paper draw the shape of a bowling pin on a piece of construction paper you can make it as big or as little as you d like just depending on how you d like it to look carefully cut the body out from the paper 9 x research source use any color of construction paper you d like though purple blue or green would work well with the color scheme of a peacock draw the eyes and beak at the top of the cut out body of the peacock use a black marker to make eyes with small black circles and draw a sideways v to make the peacock s beak you could even draw a design all over the body for more embellishment 10 x research source you could also use googly eyes for a fun alternative to drawing the eyes paste the body to the middle of the feathers to finish your peacock put white craft glue on the back of the peacock s body then press it down in the middle of the paper plate line up its bottom with the bottom of the plate let it dry completely before you hang it up 11 x research source you can continue decorating and painting your peacock even after it has been glued together if you want fold a piece of construction paper accordion style for taller feathers fold it lengthwise for wider feathers fold it widthwise each fold should be about 1 in 2 5 cm wide or smaller make a fold flip the paper over and fold that same length of paper back to create another strip continue flipping the paper over and making folds until the entire thing is one strip wide 12 x research source each fold essentially becomes a feather use purple blue green or yellow paper unfold the paper so it s flat and decorate each strip to resemble a feather unfold the paper so that you can see the entirety of it use markers pens or paint to create small designs across each feather small circles or teardrop shapes are common for peacocks use a plain black marker to keep things simple or branch out and use different colors 13 x research source you only need to decorate one side of the piece of paper refold the paper and glue the bottom edges together after you ve designed the feathers and your design has dried go ahead and refold that piece of paper then put some white craft glue along the bottom folds on one side and press them together to create the bottom of the fan hold the paper together until it sticks on its own 14 x research source this creates the beautiful backdrop of feathers for your peacock it should resemble a half circle once it s stretched out so you can see the design you made draw the body of a peacock on a differently colored piece of paper a bowling pin shape works really well make the body about 2 3 the height of the feathers go ahead and cut out the body and lay it on top of the feathers to make sure it looks proportional if you need to cut out another one or use a different color of paper until you achieve the look you desire 15 x research source choose a color different from what you used for the feathers try to pick something that ll pop like a yellow body with purple feathers or a light blue body with green feathers make legs a beak and eyes out of construction paper cut out 2 thin l shapes for the feet a triangle for the beak and circles for the eyes use a different color of paper from what you used for the body 16 x research source you could also use googly eyes or simply draw the other body parts in place if you don t want to cut them out glue the body parts onto the main body put the legs at the bottom of the body and make the feet face the same direction glue the eyes in place near the top of the body and use a marker to create the pupils put the triangle sideways beneath the eyes to create the peacock s beak 17 x research source feel free to decorate the body of the peacock even further if you d like secure the body to the feathers with glue spread out the feathers so that there is a flat bottom take a glue stick and rub it over the ridges in the middle of the feathers gently press the peacock s body down over the glued section hold it for several seconds so it ll stay in place 18 x research source you could also use double sided tape to attach the 2 pieces,Pets-and-Animals
how to make polymer clay cats,creating these fun creatures is not difficult and will start your own sculptured collection they are great to give as gifts or just to add them to your shelf containing other precious art pieces,start by kneading the clay into a ball squish and roll it and warm it until is a soft pliable consistency make it spherical and work it from there pull out the various appendages four more or less equal legs a longer tail and a fatter head give the head a couple of ears and it should already be starting to look a little bit like a cat keep sculpting until it s a plausible cat shape it might even have some personality if so you might like to go with it keep making the tail more tail like keep making the head more cat like and hopefully a personality will emerge whether through design or of its own accord roll out a sausage of glow in the dark clay for the eyes it s easier to divide a sausage evenly surprise cat eyes glowing in the dark are amusing but use your own personal preference split the sausage into two equal parts and roll them into balls work carefully on the eyes as they are the single most important part of almost any critter every little change or move can change the look for example unevenly sized eyeballs give an air of derangement so take care when working with them but be prepared for them to surprise you attach the balls to the front of the head and presto you now have a cat that can stare at people split a very small black sausage of clay in half and roll up the pieces to make the pupils attach them to the eyes this is one of the most delicate parts of the whole process because the amount of clay involved is so tiny and black you may need to use a sculpting tool or a blunt knife to attach them to the eyeballs give the cat eyelids optional you can give the cat upper and lower lids or stick with just upper lids make them from a semi circle of clay created by forming a ball then squashing and halving it shape the lids into rough semicircles and carefully affix them at a precise angle the way that the lids are attached can easily make the difference between a critter which is sweetly looking for affection and one which is brimming over with malevolence take care in attaching them carefully concentrate on the details of its body language make the cat look the way your imagination and artistic nature take you a tail is a beautifully expressive thing for instance when a cat is mad it is moving slowly the set of a cat s ears and the angle of its head can tell you a great deal the way it is standing is crucial take care to make the texture of the piece as smooth as you want it with gentle rubbing and correct any minor flaws then place it on a baking tray laying it on its side or supporting it around the middle because unbaked polymer clay legs are flimsy and become softer while being baked place the tray in an oven preheated to 130 c 265 f and bake for 20 30 minutes according to the instructions that come with the clay finished to make a ball cat you need to have one main colour use this to make 2 big balls then chop the smaller one into sixths make four of them balls again the other 2 should be slightly triangular put them on the intact ball now you have the ears put the four balls on the other side of them make it look like a cat car with no windows next make a fat sausage for the tail if you want it to look bushy and more like an original ball cat if not then do a tail like a thin worm put it on and make sure that it is smoothed on now we need to do the eyes make two small white ovals and squish them on ts head they should get bigger make black circles very small squish them on voila you re done bake it on a tray and follow the instructions on the packet that the clay came in try to use the same clay for your products as the different clay may need to be baked at different times and temperatures,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a clay piggy bank,piggy banks have been around for many years but it started in the fifteenth century when the word piggy was referred to as an orange clay this clay was used for jars and dishes to hold change in the eighteenth century the word piggy now sounded much like the word pig so a person had shaped a piggy jar which looked like a pig these piggy banks are a great gift for children to save up their change but wouldn t it be more fun to make one yourself and who said it had to be a pig what if you want an elephant bank or a turtle if you would just love to have a handmade piggy bank read this article to find out how to make one,decide on what you would like to make it s important to plan ahead so that you know what you are doing and you don t have to make a pig instead you could make a puppy bank be creative although a piggy bank is certainly fine to make think about your interests or pets such as cats or football anything that is fairly round or has a body can work if you are stuck without ideas here are some to name a few any animal usually very simple structures and cute too if you like animals this is the way to go some more specific ideas for an animal are dogs cats turtles elephants horses and rabbits sports make a ball if you re a sports lover you can make a football soccer ball basketball or bowling ball with three round holes instead of one little slit food a very creative idea but can be tricky if you want to make a food try a hamburger cupcake apple or even a stack of pancakes take a large piece of clay and roll it make sure that it is very round or else it won t be a piggy bank if however you are making a bank where the body isn t completely round such as a football shape the clay more into that shape but with animals you can add details like the head and tail later this is just the body or base of the bank where the money will be held when it is round take the clay knife and cut the clay right through the middle make sure that the halves are even so try as best as you can to cut through the center they should also be clean without any tears now you will have two half circles make two bowls take one clay piece and press your thumb through the center but not all the way start to knead with your fingers outward pushing the clay in the center to make a dent like a bowl make sure that it is somewhat deep but check the edges they shouldn t be too thick no thicker than 1 1 2 inches 3 8 cm but no thinner than 1 4 an inch at the bottom do this with both halves score the clay take the scoring tool and quickly flick it across the width of the edges of the bowl do this to both of the bowls make sure you go all the way around the bowls you score clay so that the two bowls will soon connect and stick together dip your finger in the water just a bit and apply it to both of the the bowls you scored you may have to apply the water more than once the press the two halves together and apply more water on the crack where the bowls come together you can also use your fingers the same way after applying the water or smoothing the clay with your fingers you shouldn t be able to see the crack now you have one piece of clay again cut slots with the clay knife at the top of the piggy bank stick the knife in until it goes all the way through work around that cutting a rectangle shape this is the coin slot don t make this slot too big no wider than a centimeter also make a slot for the bottom of the bank do the same thing you did for the top coin slot but make this one a circle make sure that it is big enough for a quarter to come out but don t make it too big or else all of the coins will quickly come through add details to the body of the bank this is the fun part if you are making an animal roll extra pieces of clay for the head and stick them on the body of the bank by scoring adding water and smoothing it with your fingers add a tail for certain animals legs for legs make oval shapes and gently flatten them on a surface you can then add them to your animal this works great with elephants and turtles but make sure that the legs are thick enough to support the rest of the body face to add a face use the clay knife to poke eyes and a mouth for your animal you can use the clay knife for other details too like writing in letters numbers or anything that would add to your bank cook the clay put the bank in an oven for a few minutes the temperature should be 50 degrees celsius 122 degrees fahrenheit paint the clay with glaze be creative paint over your bank the way you like it you can add polka dots to your pig or purple frosting to your cupcake but it is good to paint over your bank at least twice so the colors stay on let the glaze dry for an hour or two put the clay in the oven again optional on 93 degrees celsius 200 degrees fahrenheit for 10 minutes enjoy your piggy bank finished,Pets-and-Animals

how to make a dinosaur tail,a dinosaur tail can be used in a halloween costume or be a new accessory for a dress up game best of all this fun brightly colored tail only takes 1 2 hours to make if you re familiar with a sewing machine you can stitch your dinosaur tail together for a quicker assembly you can use hot glue it only takes a few pieces of fabric and some fiber stuffing to take your child s imagination to the next level,cut a series of triangles into a long strip of fabric snip out a line of connected triangles from the strip the total length of the strip should be 24 inches 61 cm by 2 inches 5 1 cm when you re done the felt should look like a miniature mountain range set this aside for later 1 x research source this strip will become the spikes of the dinosaur tail so feel free to pick a bright fun color when flattened the fabric will look like a row of diamonds this will be fixed later on when the spikes are folded and glued together use fabric scissors for a quicker and smoother cut trace the edge of a bowl onto the main fabric and cut it out flip over a bowl and trace its circumference onto the felt the diameter of the bowl will be the width of your dinosaur tail so make sure that it s wide enough 2 x research source cut out 2 strips of fabric for the waist straps and glue them in place use fabric scissors to cut 24 inches 61 cm by 2 inches 5 1 cm rectangular strips from the tail fabric then fold in the edges lengthwise and glue them into place fold the fabric in half again and glue both sides together so the straps are less than 1 inch 2 5 cm thick 3 x research source crease and glue the line of fabric spikes together use short lines of hot glue to connect the folded spikes instead of looking like a row of diamonds the felt will now look like a row of triangles 4 x research source cut a large curved triangle out of fabric to make the base of the tail measure out a curved triangle along the edge of a folded piece of fabric you don t have to use specific measurements but make sure that the tail will fit around your circular piece 5 x research source attach the spikes to the inner seam of the tail with hot glue use small lines of hot glue to connect the felt spikes with the outer edge of the tail apply glue on both sides of the spikes as this piece will hold the tail together put pressure on the glued areas with your fingertips to secure the spiked tail into place 6 x research source use additional glue at the pointy end of the tail to provide extra support add extra glue as needed to connect the rest of the tail together put fiber stuffing into the tail until it s fully stuffed take a bag of fiber filling and stuff the tail completely place as much or as little stuffing as you would like inside 7 x research source make sure that the pointy end of the tail is completely filled before continuing to stuff the rest glue the waist straps and circular piece to the inside of the tail s base take the waist strips and glue them on opposite ends of one another using small lines of hot glue these straps should be perpendicular to the line of spikes make sure that the circular base is glued snugly over the waist straps and is covering the end of the tail 8 x research source you can tie the waist straps together to secure the tail when your child wears it fold the fabric in half and mark 12 inches 30 cm above the crease take 1 yard 0 91 m of fabric and fold it in half horizontally use a tape measure preferably non mechanical and mark 12 inches 30 cm above your starting point on the fold this indicates the height of your dinosaur tail 9 x research source make sure that your measuring tape expands to at least 3 feet 0 91 m make a second mark 24 inches 61 cm down the fabric measure 24 inches 61 cm from your starting point and mark the fabric this 24 inches 61 cm distance will serve as the length of your dinosaur tail 10 x research source make sure that you have enough fabric for these measurements make a third mark 2 inches 5 1 cm above the second mark take your measuring tape and make a dot 2 inches 5 1 cm above the second mark this third measurement represents the pointy bottom end of the tail 11 x research source connect the 3 marks with a marker and cut out the tail shape use a fabric marker to sketch the line that connects these three points before removing the piece with scissors or a rotary cutter rotary cutters can be found at most craft stores and provide a more even and exact cut along the edge of your fabric 12 x research source if you want to make your lines exact use these measurements to sketch and cut a template out of cardboard beforehand 13 x research source trace a plate on fabric twice to create 2 circles for the tail s base place a ceramic plate onto the fabric and cut around it with scissors or a rotary cutter repeat this process so that you have 2 circles the diameter of this circle will be the width of your dinosaur tail 14 x research source use folded fabric if you want to cut 2 circles out at once measure and cut out 2 pieces of fabric to create the waist straps use a measuring tape to mark and cut out 2 strips of fabric the length should be 12 inches 30 cm and the width should be 4 inches 10 cm 15 x research source these strips will help attach the dinosaur to a child s waist sketch a series of triangles onto a piece of felt using a fabric marker use a ruler or measuring tape to sketch a row of triangles onto the felt make the triangles which will be the tail spikes about 2 inches 5 1 cm tall and 2 inches 5 1 cm wide ensure that there s 0 5 inches 1 3 cm between each spike 16 x research source you can make the spikes bigger or smaller depending on how you want the tail to look at the end you can also make individual triangular spikes 17 x research source arrange the cut spikes on the edge of the tail fabric and pin them in place use fabric scissors to cut the spikes out of the felt begin constructing your dinosaur tail by positioning the trail of spikes between the folds of the base tail fabric pin the spikes so that they face inward as you will be sewing the fabric from the inside out 18 x research source use a sewing machine to attach the spikes to the main fabric feed the fabric through the machine to stitch the base tail fabric and spikes together go along the curved shape of the tail leaving less than a 0 5 inches 1 3 cm of space between the stitches and the fabric s edge pinch and tug on the fabric on the inside of the tail to pull the tail right side out remember to remove the pins from the fabric as you sew fold and pin the waist strap fabric at the ends before sewing the edges together crease the fabric along the center so that the short ends are touching and use a few pins to secure the fabric in this position stitch the edges together lengthwise but leave the shorter end open pinch the fabric on the inside of the stitching to pull the straps right side out you ll be stitching the shorter unsewn ends of the waist straps into the base of the tail stitch the velcro rectangles to the straps and attach the waist straps to the tail take a small rectangle of velcro and place it on the sewn end of the waist strap before stitching it into place with a sewing machine then take the unstitched ends of the waist straps and pin them to the inside of the tail make sure that the straps are placed perpendicular to the spikes before sewing them into place check to see that the strap is long enough to wrap around a child s waist pin the straps onto the tail and sew them into place 19 x research source you can purchase velcro at a craft store you can also sew velcro by hand 20 x research source pin the base circles along the edges and stitch together take the 2 base circles and secure them with pins along the edges make sure that the circles are centered against one another before you sew them together 21 x research source leave at least 1 inch 2 5 cm of space to turn the circle right side out after sewing the edges together pinch and tug at the inner fabric of the circle to make pull it right side out fill the tail with stuffing until it has a firm shape take fiber filling and stuff the base of the tail use as much fiber as you need to completely fill the dinosaur tail 22 x research source you can buy fiber filling at a craft store you may need more than one bag to fully stuff the tail use a ladder stitch to close off the base and complete the tail tuck and fold the excess fabric into the tail before sewing it shut with a ladder stitch this part can be completed by hand 23 x research source the ladder stitch helps all portions of stitching to look uniform,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper dinosaur,with the right supplies and a bit of time you can make your very own paper dinosaur that stands or moves if you d like a bigger craft project you could even attempt a paper mache dinosaur or an origami dinosaur depending on the colors that you use you can make your dinosaur look realistic or cartoonish,glue a sheet of green construction paper to a piece of thin cardboard this will make your dinosaur nice and sturdy if you don t have any green construction paper paint the cardboard with green acrylics or poster paint let the glue or paint dry before moving on 1 x research source the thin cardboard from cereal and snack boxes works great for this if you don t have thin cardboard or construction paper try green cardstock instead you can also use poster paper but you ll need to paint it draw and cut the body head tail and leg shapes from the paper look up coloring book or cartoon pictures of long necked dinosaurs then break it down into separate body parts draw these separately with a pen or pencil then cut them out here are the basic shapes you ll need 2 x research source a long stem with an oval shaped head like a brontosaurus or apatosaurus a long tapering tail like a skinny triangle 2 rectangular legs a mound or lump shaped body like a semicircle but with rounded bottom corners make spikes for the dino s back using paper and cardboard if desired glue the paper to the cardboard first or paint the cardboard let the paint or glue dry then draw 4 to 5 triangular spikes cut them out then set them aside 3 x research source use a different color of paint or paper for this orange is a great choice but a lighter or darker shade of green will also work you can also make smaller rectangles for nails use a pen to poke a hole in the ends of each limb make the holes 1 4 to 1 2 in 0 64 to 1 27 cm away from the center of each edge a pen or pencil will work just fine for a cardstock dino but if you used thin cardboard use a nail to make the holes instead 4 x research source you ll need holes in the following areas base of the neck base of the tail and the top of each leg don t use a hole punch the hole will be too big and the brad will fall through if you re a child ask an adult to help you with this step especially if you re using a nail poke 4 holes in the body so that you can secure the limbs make 2 holes along the wider flatter bottom edge of the body poke another set of holes on the sides of the body for the tail and legs as with the limbs make the holes 1 4 to 1 2 in 0 64 to 1 27 cm from the edges 5 x research source don t poke the neck and tail holes too close to the top make them closer to the bottom so that your dinosaur has a humped back don t place the legs too close together keep them closer to the bottom corners of the body use brads to secure the limbs behind the dinosaur s body stick a brad through the front of the neck hole on the body slide the neck piece onto the back of the prong behind the body pry open the back of the brad then press the prongs flat against the back of the dinosaur 6 x research source repeat this step for the tail and both legs always add the limbs to the back of the body not the front make sure that the limbs are facing up as well otherwise your dinosaur won t match brad prongs can hurt if they get under your nail consider using a butter knife to pry them apart glue the spikes to the back of the dinosaur flip the dinosaur over so that you can see the back draw a line of glue along its back then add the triangular spikes make sure that the flat bases are touching the dinosaur s back while the pointy tips are sticking out 7 x research source if you made nails for the dino glue them to the bottom of each leg white school glue and glue sticks will work just fine for this hot glue is not recommended because it s too bulky give the dinosaur a face here is where you can get a little creative for a simple dinosaur use a black marker to draw an eye and mouth for a fancier dinosaur use hot glue or white school glue to attach a googly eye to the dinosaur s face 8 x research source give your dinosaur more character by adding eyebrows or eyelashes fold and cut a plain white paper plate in half with scissors fold the plate in half first then use the crease as a cutting guide for best results use the kind that s made from cardstock and has a frilled edge rather than the kind that s made from thick cardboard with a rim 9 x research source set aside 1 of the paper plate halves this will make the body cut a dino head tail and spikes from the other paper plate half draw the shapes on the second paper plate half the other one will be the body then cut them out make sure that the limbs are proportionate to the body don t worry about the feet you will be using toilet paper rolls for that 10 x research source make the spikes about 1 in 2 5 cm tall and wide make the tail about 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm wide at the base and about 1 2 to 2 3 the length of the paper plate if you don t know how to draw a dinosaur head tail or spikes look at pictures of cartoon dinosaurs online or in coloring books use the brim to make the neck if desired cut it off first so that you get a c shape then cut it in half use 1 of these halves to make the neck glue the cut shapes to the other paper plate half the straight edge of the plate is the bottom of the dinosaur while the curved side is the back glue the tail to 1 end and the neck and or head to the other if you made spikes glue them down the dinosaur s back 11 x research source use scissors to cut an empty toilet paper roll into thirds keep 2 of the segments and discard the third this will give you rings that are a little over 1 in 2 5 cm tall if you don t have any empty toilet paper rolls you can use an empty paper towel roll instead 12 x research source if you re using an empty paper towel roll cut 2 1 to 2 in 2 5 to 5 1 cm segments from it cut a set of slits into the top of each toilet paper ring you will be sliding the dinosaur s body into these slits so make sure that they are directly across from each other the easiest way to do this would be to squish the rings in half then cut a 1 2 in 1 3 cm long slit into each one 13 x research source slide the dinosaur into the slits take the first roll and turn it so that 1 slit is facing the dinosaur s head and the other is facing its tail slide the bottom edge of the dinosaur s body into the slit repeat this process for the other leg 14 x research source slide the legs apart until they are on opposite sides of the plate paint the dinosaur then let it dry acrylic craft paints will work great for this but you can also use poster paint too use the same colors and patterns for both the front and back how long it will take for the paint to dry depends on what you are using expect to wait about 15 to 20 minutes however 15 x research source you can take the dinosaur s body off of its feet in order to paint it do the front first let it dry then do the back don t forget to paint the eyes and mouth alternatively you can glue on some googly eyes after the paint has dried blow up a balloon tear newspaper into strips and make a papier mâché paste blow up a balloon to your desired size next tear some newspaper into narrow strips about 1 by 3 in 2 5 by 7 6 cm lastly prepare your preferred papier mâché glue or paste 16 x research source the most popular papier mâché paste is just 1 part water and 1 part pva glue white school glue start with just 1 or 2 sheets of newspaper you can always make more strips don t cut the strips or the edges will be too sharp and create creases tearing them will give you a smoother finish dip the strips into the paste then apply them to the balloon run each strip of newspaper between your fingers after dipping it in the paste this will remove any excess glue make sure that the strips are all going in the same direction as you apply them 17 x research source overlap the strips a little such as by 1 4 to 1 2 in 0 64 to 1 27 cm keep the balloon in a cup or bowl so that it doesn t roll around you may have to let 1 side of the balloon dry first before doing the other leave a coin sized space at one end of the balloon exposed so that you can pop the balloon later apply 2 more layers of papier mâché you probably don t need to use the glue for the second layer the wet strips already adhered to the balloon should be enough for the new ones to stick to if the balloon starts to get too soggy however let it dry a bit then continue working consider using white tissue paper for as a fourth and final layer this will give you a smoother base and help the paint show up better if you choose to use tissue paper then make sure that you tear it into 3 by 1 in 7 6 by 2 5 cm strips as well let the strips dry overnight then pop and remove the balloon you may have to wait even longer than that depending on how dry or humid it is in your home in fact it would be a good idea to poke your finger under the papier mâché if it feels wet give it a little more time 18 x research source this completes your dinosaur s body don t worry about the hole left by the balloon you ll end up covering it with the dinosaur s head or tail tape paper towel roll segments to the balloon for legs turn the papier mâché balloon on its side then use masking tape to secure the legs to the bottom 19 x research source don t use clear tape it won t stick to the papier mâché you can also just cut 2 empty toilet paper rolls in half and use those instead use cardboard paper towel tubes and foil to make the other limbs scrunch up aluminum foil into a ball to make a head and then use aluminum foil shaped into a cone for the tail the size and shape for each depends on what type of dinosaur that you re making so look at some reference pictures here are some more ideas to get you started 20 x research source triceratops cut a round scalloped shape out of cardboard for the fan use foil to make the horns stegosaurus cut triangles out of cardboard for the fins apatosaurus brontosaurus use a paper towel tube to make the neck tape the pieces to the body with masking tape take 1 of your pieces and hold it against the balloon where you want it to go secure it with strips of masking tape until the seam is completely hidden again don t use clear tape because it won t hold triceratops tape the fan to the balloon first then add the head you may have to use hot glue to secure it finish by sticking the horns to the head stegosaurus tape or hot glue the head to 1 side of the body and the tail to the other use strips of tape to add the fins down the back and tail apatosaurus brontosaurus tape the head to the long neck first then tape the head to the body add the tail to the other side of the body cover the pieces and the seams with more papier mâché start by applying strips of papier mâché to the seams after that cover the shapes themselves if the pieces feel unstable add more papier mâché to the seams 21 x research source you may have to tear more strips of newspaper and prepare more papier mâché paste for this consider making some smaller strips for sharp curves and tight corners if the hole from when you removed the balloon is still visible cover it up with more papier mâché wait for everything to dry how long it will take for your project to dry really depends on what the weather is like papier mâché will dry a lot faster on a hot dry sunny day than on a cold wet day be patient 22 x research source paint the dinosaur as desired then let the paint dry acrylic craft paint will work just fine for this but you can use poster paint too you can use realistic colors for your dinosaur like gray brown and green or you can use fantasy colors like pink purple and blue 23 x research source for a nicer finish paint the dinosaur white first then let the paint dry this will give you a clean canvas to work on don t forget to add eyes and a mouth you can paint the eyes or glue googly eyes on instead how long it will take for the paint to dry will depend on what type of paint you re using plan to wait about 15 to 20 minutes however,Pets-and-Animals

how to make a clay dog,making clay dogs is a fun activity especially for children creating and collecting clay dogs can be a fun hobby or you can make a clay dog as a special gift for a friend even if you have never tried to make animals out of clay you can pick up the basics in just a few minutes as you get better you can create more detailed and intricate clay dog designs,select your clay there are many different kinds of clay any of which can create a dog deciding which clay to use depends on your desired end result select your colors you may choose to purchase different colors of clay to create the dog or you can select to use one solid color and paint the dog after it is finished some clays like polymer can be baked into a finished piece very quickly in an oven if you don t have an oven to use for your clay you may prefer to select an air dry clay however you will have to wait four or five days to finish it if you are doing clay animation you will want to select an oil based clay that will not dry out 1 x research source break down the clay into manageable pieces instead of trying to mold a dog shape from a large chunk of clay break apart the clay into several smaller pieces keep one larger piece to create the torso of the dog break off a piece for the head make four pieces of equal size to create the legs roll the pieces into balls to try and keep the size as even as possible for each leg make one smaller piece for the tail set the remainder aside to use for other small shapes that remain such as the ears and eyes make the body form a cylindrical shape with the largest piece of clay roll some clay into a ball and shape it into a rectangle round the edges a little to make the rectangular body look like a dog body you may want to adjust the torso to be smaller or larger depending on the kind of dog you want to create for example a basset hound or dachshund will have a much longer body but much shorter limbs if you are making a large sculpture you may want to crumple up damp newspaper and mold the clay around it this will save you clay make the sculpture lighter and save you time when baking 2 x research source shape the head you can shape a single piece by forming a pointed snout at the front and rounding the back or you can shape a separate ball of clay for the snout and press it to the front of the face stick it on the top of the end of the body to keep the head in place you might want to insert a toothpick halfway into the body of the dog then place the head on the top half of the toothpick roll out four identical cylinder shapes for the legs flatten the bottoms and add pads with brown or black clay put two legs on the back of the dog and two legs on the front use the legs to help create the pose for your dog you might want to make him stand sit or lie down it is entirely up to you make a tail roll another piece of clay between your hands to create the tail you might want to make it long and pointy or short and stubby it depends entirely on the kind of dog you want to create attach the tail to the rear of the dog add some details you will want to have ears a snout mouth eyes and a nose you can use smaller pieces of clay to shape the pieces or use your modeling tools to carve some of them into the existing form the more time you take creating details the more lifelike your dog will be consider adding a tongue add a small piece of thin clay out the side of your dog s mouth try pressing two small lines into each paw to create some toes if you are using different colors of clay you can give your dogs some spots by adding small thin patches of different colors over the body or legs create a collar by forming a long flat strip and wrapping it around the neck of the dog heat the oven check the instructions for your polymer clay to find the right temperature and time for the type of clay and the size of your clay dog polymer clays will all cook at a temperature between 215 f 102 c to 325 f 163 c 3 x research source place the clay dog on a glass or ceramic tile wait until the oven reaches the desired temperature place the tile with the dog on it on the middle rack of your oven set a timer so you know when the time is up follow the cooking times suggested by the manufacturer for your type of clay the larger your clay dog is the longer it will take you to cook it in the oven 4 x research source use an oven thermometer certain ovens use rapid heating systems that can create dips and spikes in the temperature you should try to monitor the temperature in the oven to make sure your clay isn t getting too hot or not hot enough too cold and your clay may become brittle too hot and you may end up burning the clay 5 x research source remove the dog from the oven when the timer goes off take out your clay dog leave the dog to cool on the ceramic tile don t worry if the clay doesn t appear firm when you first remove it from the oven as the clay cools down it will harden use oven mitts when handling the tile it will be hot use acrylic paints you don t need to wash or sand your clay beforehand just brush on your base coat then add as much or little detail as you like select the colors that suit your type of dog you might use mainly brown and black for a rottweiler or white and black for a dalmatian avoid spray on paints as they contain a solvent that can degrade your clay let the paint dry it may take 15 20 minutes to dry from the time you finish painting brush on a coat of clear varnish use a different brush to apply the varnish this will give your clay dog a nice glossy finish the coat of varnish will seal in the paint and help protect it from chipping,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a paper dog,there are several fun ways to create a paper dog and luckily all of them require very few materials create a fun miniature dog that can stand on its own legs out of origami paper or make a folded dog face with a playful expression you could even make paper dog hand puppets to play with,select a piece of origami paper for your dog depending on what you have available choose either a 3 by 3 in 7 6 by 7 6 cm 6 by 6 in 15 by 15 cm or 10 by 10 in 25 by 25 cm piece of paper the bigger the sheet of paper the bigger your dog will be brown tan or white are common dog colors but don t hesitate to choose something more unconventional for your origami creation 1 x research source if you don t have origami paper use something else that is thin and easy to fold like newspaper magazine pages or even wrapping paper cut the substitute into the right dimensions so you have a perfectly square piece of paper fold the square of paper in half to create a triangle take the top left corner and fold it across so it meets the bottom right corner forming a triangle shape run your finger along the fold to create a crease 2 x research source use the back of your nail or something hard like the body of a pen to make your crease lines more defined open the square back up and fold it in half diagonally the other way unfold the paper so it is a square again make another triangle by folding the top right corner across to the bottom left corner press down along the fold line to make another crease 3 x research source it s really important in origami to have straight defined creases that is what enables your creation to stand upright once you ve finished unfold the square again and place it in front of you open up the piece of paper and set it in front of you make the bottom of the square parallel to your body 4 x research source there should be an x formed by the creases on the unfolded piece of paper bring the bottom left corner to the center point of the square and fold with the square unfolded in front of you take the bottom left corner and place its tip in the center of the square where the 2 creases intersect to create an x press the fold down to make a crease 5 x research source making firm creases will also keep the folded pieces of paper in place while you work on other sections otherwise you might risk things coming undone and losing your place in your project repeat the previous step to bring all the corners to the center one at a time take each remaining corner top left top right bottom right and fold them so their points are in the center of the square fold and press down the crease for each corner 6 x research source essentially this step turns the original square into a smaller square all the sides should still be equal to one another you will now have left top right and bottom sides with all points meeting in the middle of the square open the left flap fold it in half and then fold it back in place unfold the left hand side piece of paper fold the point in half so that the tip of it meets the intersection of your previous fold line then fold the entire left flap back into place 7 x research source there should be an open triangle when you look down at your square take the tip of the right flap and fold it back to overlap the edge line leave the flap folded to the center point take the tip of the corner that is in the center and fold it back about 2 3rds of the way make your crease so that the top forms a triangle that overhangs the outer edge of the square 8 x research source leave the top and bottom flaps in place and don t do anything to them at this point this fold will eventually become the dog s tail fold the entire square in half lengthwise pick up the piece of paper fold it in half evenly lengthwise to create the left and right sides of your origami dog when the fold is done set the paper down in front of you so that the pointy tail is pointing to the right 9 x research source take your time when lining up the center fold if the lines aren t straight your dog will be wobbly unfold the top flap and crease it from the top left to bottom right corner unfold the flap of paper from the top section of the dog so that its point is pointing toward your body then fold the entire section of paper up and create a diagonal fold that starts at the top left corner and finishes at the bottom right corner 10 x research source at this point in the folding process you re making the dog s head and legs refold the right edge along the crease line after making the diagonal fold take the point of the piece of paper you just folded up and bring it back down along the original crease line this creates the slant of the dog s leg 11 x research source the bottom edge should be in line with the ground if you were to pretend to stand it up repeat the previous 2 steps on the opposite side flip the piece of paper over unfold the flap of paper and make a diagonal fold from the top right corner to the bottom left corner then fold the paper back down along its original crease line to form the other leg 12 x research source even though you re nearing the end remember to take your time and make your folds as straight and defined as you can pull out the fold inside the dog s nose when you look at the piece of paper you should now see the dog s tail body triangle legs and triangle head look under the dog s nose and carefully pull out the fold this creates the dog s mouth and gives it a more realistic look 13 x research source the crease line creates a jawline for the dog draw a nose and eyes onto the dog to complete it take a marker and put an eye on each side of the dog as well as a nose for the nose just fill in the area around the front tip of the head you could also draw a little smile or any other embellishments you feel are appropriate 14 x research source once you get the hang of the pattern you can make an origami dog in just a few minutes choose a piece of origami paper for your project origami specific paper comes in squares which means it s ready to use and you don t need to cut it at all the larger the piece of paper you choose the bigger the dog head will be choose a color for your dog whether that is brown black white tan or an unconventional color like blue or green 15 x research source if you don t have origami paper cut a thin sheet of paper like newspaper or wrapping paper into a square fold the top left corner to the bottom right corner to make a triangle match up the 2 corners so that the sides are equal press the fold down firmly to create a crease 16 x research source to help crease the paper push the fold down with the back of your nail or with the body of a pen the stronger the crease the better definition your dog head will have bring the 2 bottom corners together to make a smaller triangle leave your first fold in place bring the bottom points together and make another fold to form a smaller triangle 17 x research source take your time when making your folds and line up the edges neatly unfold the triangle once and place it so the tip is pointing at your body undo the last fold you did so that just the large triangle is left position the paper so that the top of the triangle is pointing at you 18 x research source you ll use the center crease as a guide for your future folds make a diagonal fold on the right hand side starting at the center crease make a bigger fold for bigger dog ears or a smaller fold for smaller ears make the crease start at the center line and fold the right side corner down at a diagonal angle 19 x research source keep the fold lined up with the center crease to create a proportional face repeat the previous step on the opposite side try your best to create the same angle so that your dog s ears are the same size start the diagonal fold at the center crease line 20 x research source when you look down at your paper you should see a very angular looking dog head fold back the bottom and top points to create straight lines fold back the top tip of the dog s head just enough so that there is a flat line connecting the 2 ears fold the bottom tip back to create a jaw line for the dog 21 x research source if you need to use a little bit of glue or double sided tape to secure the points to the back of the dog s head draw the rest of the dog s features to complete your project use a black marker to draw eyes a nose and a mouth on the paper you can get as detailed as you want to but for basic features make circles for eyes and an upside down triangle for the nose for the mouth make a j attached to a backwards j coming out of the tip of the dog s nose 22 x research source you can get as creative as you d like with designing the dog s face try making spots on the ears or giving it whiskers or a tongue fold a piece of paper lengthwise into 3 equal sections use a piece of construction paper or computer paper or anything that comes close in size to 8 5 by 11 in 22 by 28 cm this piece of paper will be the dog s head so use whatever color you d like for that white works well but brown black or even an unconventional color like red would be fine 23 x research source avoid using really thin paper for this craft you ll be sticking your hands into the folds so it needs to be a little thicker to hold up glue the last fold down with your glue stick to help your craft stay together apply some glue to the back of the last fold press it down so it adheres to the other side 24 x research source glue sticks work great because they don t take long to dry if you don t have a glue stick try using double sided tape fold the paper in half so the seam is on the outside bring the short ends of the paper together making a crease in the middle fold the paper so that the side you just glued is facing up 25 x research source if you accidentally fold it the wrong way the first time that s okay just unfold it and reverse the direction fold the open edge to the bottom crease on each side on each side of the paper take the top edge and fold it back so it s in line with the bottom and make a crease after you ve done this on each side hold up the paper and check that it makes an m 26 x research source the top and bottom sections are where you ll place your fingers to make the puppet talk cut out the dog s ears and tongue and glue them into place use different colors of construction paper to cut out oblong shapes for the ears and tongue use your glue stick to attach them to the paper place the tongue inside the mouth and glue the ears on the top of the paper one on each side of the head 27 x research source for example if you used white paper for the dog s head use red paper for the tongue and black paper for the ears draw on the eyes and nose to complete your puppet use a black marker to draw circles for eyes and an upside down triangle for the nose you could even put 3 small dots on either side of the nose to make whiskers use your imagination and enjoy the decoration process 28 x research source to use the hand puppet simply put your thumb in the bottom flap and your fingers in the top flap when you open and close your hand the dog s mouth will open and close too,Pets-and-Animals
how to paint a portrait of a dog,painting a dog portrait can be a challenging endeavor for a beginner but very rewarding when you can capture your dog s individual personality this tutorial will guide you through the process of painting any breed of dog,practice drawing straight lines take a piece of paper and draw randomly spaced dots around the edges practice drawing straight lines between all the dots this will come in handy when you are finding the proportions and placing the features of the dog s head practice color mixing use a simple computer painting program to print out a sheet of small randomly colored squares mix small portions of these colors as accurately as you can with your chosen opaque paint even if you work digitally buy some cheap paints and practice mixing being able to identify the mixing components of a color is extremely helpful for matching the colors of your subject if you are doing opaque painting you need to try coloring on the actual material that you want to paint on this will allow you to foresee how the material absorbs and paints diffuse which can help you to create different effects choose a reference image creating a painting that looks three dimensional is easier if you can accurately judge the forms of your subject good lighting is a key factor to doing this well choose a reference image that features a single strong direct light source that creates a clear separation of light and shadow you can identify a direct light source by looking for hard edged cast shadows a simple uniform background makes it easier to see the outline of the subject map out the proportions of your subject ensure that the proportions of your painted subject are correct by mapping out key features in the reference for comparison look for major lines of action red lines such as the center line of the head or the tilt of the eyes when sketching in other features compare their placement and orientation to these lines note the angles blue lines that parts of the head make with each other these angles remain the same regardless of the size of your painting pick out spots that are easy to keep track of such as the points of the ears the nostrils and hard corners where the jaw and collar overlap with the neck negative space yellow area is the shape created by the area around the subject in many cases negative space is far simpler and easier to judge than the shapes inside the subject sketch the under structure begin by drawing the major lines of action draw straight lines between the key features making sure the angles are accurate using simple lines makes it easy to adjust proportions before drawing in more complicated forms resist drawing small details and focus instead on correctly placing the biggest forms the sketch should show accurate proportions keep adjusting your guidelines until all the forms are the correct size identify basic light medium and dark value areas in the reference understanding how light is hitting your subject is the most important factor in making your painting look three dimensional light value areas are most directly facing the light source there are two types of medium value areas planes of the form that are turning away from the light and about to go into shadow light is bouncing off of objects behind the subject and hitting them from the opposite side but much less strongly than the direct light this is called reflected light dark value areas are where the least amount of light is shining on the subject because the planes of the form are tangent to the light sources so they aren t getting light from either the front or back they occur between medium value areas and are called core shadows paint in the basic values on your under structure sketch mix 4 neutral gray values light medium dark and a background value don t try to perfectly match any values because this under painting will be completely covered by the final colors the different value areas are only an organizational tool apply the values using the sketch as a guide working with only four values makes this step simple and fast use a large brush if you have trouble placing the medium values try painting only light and dark first before adding medium step back 10 feet 3 meters from the painting to get an overall impression the painting should begin look like a three dimensional form with light shining on it start applying color using your under painting as a guide this is where the painting begins to really look like the dog reference using the reference for comparison mix colors for each value section defined by your under painting and lay in the colors within the pre mapped areas with a large brush after the biggest areas are painted layer on additional colors but keep using the large brush identify large plane boundaries in the reference and sketch them into the painting as a guide with all the large shapes in place switch down to a medium brush and start refining the edges of major forms such as the jaw and large skin creases it may be useful to sketch guidelines into the painting as they can easily be covered up with a new layer step back 10 feet 3 meters from the painting the illusion of light should be very strong you might forget the shadows are only painted add detail to the nose and mouth as with the rest of the body the tongue and nose can be broken down into larger planes to plan out the form once you have them looking as if light is shining on them go in with even finer details to make the snout look wet look at your reference for the placement of small bright hard highlights these are called specular reflections they occur where the light source is being completely reflected off the surface add detail to the eyes note that the white of the eye is rarely white under normal lighting conditions because it is recessed into the head and cast into shadow by the skin around it capturing these shadows is the key to making the eye appear to be set in the face and not just painted on the surface small bright specular highlights give the eye a glassy sparkle add detail to the ears the ears are composed of a few large planes that turn up at the edges be sure to establish the forms before adding graphic elements like spots and remember that the spots are affected by the light and shadow of the plane they are on as well continue adding details until you re satisfied with the results smooth everything out now that all the forms are in place and sufficiently detailed you can go back and blend rough patches of color together if you want a smoother slicker look to the painting keep plane boundaries fairly sharp though or the painting may start to look blurry and flat then step back 10 feet 3 meters from the painting and enjoy the finished product,Pets-and-Animals

how to make an origami dragon,origami has been a japanese tradition for centuries and is a modern art form there are many different methods used to fold dragons and each has its own style and artistry most dragons are intermediate to advanced level origami creations but you can attempt a beginner level dragon if you are just starting out by following a few steps you can create a beautiful origami dragon,try this dragon if you are an intermediate level origami folder you should know how to fold the origami bird base and origami flapping bird before trying this method if not go onto method 2 for making a beginner level dragon start with a square piece of origami paper a good size is 7 centimeter 2 8 in x 7 centimeter 2 8 in paper but other sizes will work if you are a beginner it is best to start with bigger paper 20cm by 20cm because it is easier to work with 1 x research source if you only have a regular letter size piece of paper make it square by folding the left corner diagonally down to the right side then take the upper right corner and fold it down to the left connecting to the left corner where the first fold was made there will be a bottom rectangle left over fold this backwards and crease it well unfold the whole paper and cut or tear if you creased it really well off the rectangle you will now have a square piece of paper fold paper diagonally horizontally and vertically to create asterisk like creases you should do each of these individually unfolding before the next fold be careful and exact with your folds making sure the creases are deep and the corners are sharp squash fold the paper into a square base fold the top corner of the paper down to the bottom bringing the right and left corners to the bottom at the same time bring the right and left corners to the bottom by folding the paper in between the bottom and top layers or squash folding it it should now look like a square diamond if you are using colored paper the colored side should be on the outside at this point start with the colored side down when making the square base to do this turn it into a bird base fold the top layers of both sides to the center and then fold the top triangle down unfold these three folds do a petal fold by lifting the top layer from the bottom corner all the way up folding in the sides at the same time along the crease to create a diamond turn the paper over and do the same thing on the opposite side fold along the sides to the center and the top triangle down unfold these folds lift up the top layer all the way to the top and fold in along the sides to create a diamond this is the bird base while completing the bird base and bringing the bottom corner to the top corner the paper will look a bit like an open flower pull up the flap of paper on both sides and then squish the layer so it overlaps this makes the head and tail it will now look very pointy with a point on the left that will be the head a point in the middle that will become the wings and a point on the right that will become the tail to make the head lift the left side flap slightly and pull the top corner of the paper down in between the back and top layers bring it so that it is angled slightly down so the head will eventually be pointing diagonally up and crease the fold to make the tail lift the right side flap slightly and pull the top right corner down in between the back and top layers crease it where it is horizontal when you look at it so that it will extend straight out turn the diamond around so the head is facing upward rotate the paper 180 degrees you want the unfolded point of the diamond pointing to the top so that you can add detail and continue with your folding now the head will point up on the left side add details to the head you can add a jaw and horn and or thin the neck to add detail to the head and make it more dragon like to add a jaw fold the tip of the head down to the lower corner on that side and unfold hold the neck with one hand and push the head against the neck with your other hand the neck should fold inwards so that the head folds slightly over the neck creating a jaw to add a horn fold the tip of the head down to the bottom point of the jaw and unfold open the head by separating the top layer from the bottom layer so you can fold this small piece backwards this will create a horn on the top of the dragonhead to thin the neck fold in both sides take small parts of the bottom edges of the neck and fold them in between the layers do this in about three different pieces to trim the fat on the neck and make it slimmer add details to the tail fold to make it look thinner and or spikier it s up to you be creative to put spikes in the tail open the layers of the tail and fold back the tip upwards wherever you wish your spike to be then fold most of the rest of the tail back out leaving a small crimp in the tail you can do this near the tip or in the middle of both you can do a few crimps as well reclose the tail to thin the tail open the layers and fold the bottom edges inwards this can again be done in multiple locations to create a thin whippy looking tail add details to the wings starting with the left wing with head facing to the left fold the top layer of the top corner down to the bottom corner between the head and tail and unfold open the left flap of the wing and then fold down the entire wing and tuck inside the loose flap closing down over the wing then fold the loose flap to the left and open the wing by bringing the bottom corner to the top again fold the right and left corners to the inside and unfold push in the right side should be colored of the wing so that it pops in re crease the left side by bringing the left corner to the colored side keep a thumb over the right side while you do so to prevent it from popping out again repeat with the right wing open the wings by pulling on the chest and tail pull gently on the chest and tail of the dragon to make the wings pump as if it is flying try this dragon if you are a beginning origami folder this simple dragon is perfect for those who are learning how to fold origami you will learn how to make a kite fold and an inside reverse fold by completing this dragon 2 x research source start with a square piece of origami paper a good size is 7 centimeter 2 8 in x 7 centimeter 2 8 in paper but other sizes will work if you re a beginner consider to start with bigger paper 20cm by 20cm because it is easier to work with if you only have a regular letter size piece of paper make it square by folding the upper left corner diagonally down to meet the right side then take the upper right corner and fold it down to the left connecting to the left corner where the first fold was made there will be a bottom rectangle left over fold this backwards and crease it well unfold the whole paper and cut or tear if you creased it really well off the rectangle you should now have a square piece of paper 3 x research source turn the paper so that the crease runs vertically fold the paper in half along the crease then unfold fold the side corners so that they meet at the center line then crease this is called the kite fold unfold and then repeat the kite fold from the top corner fold the right and left corners again into the center diagonal line starting from the top corner this time keep these sides folded for now turn the paper over and bring the new side corners again to the center from the bottom corner bring the edges created by the kite fold into the center diagonal line in a valley fold then again bring the outside corners of the top layer into the center diagonal line from the bottom corner there will now be what looks like pleats on each side of the diamond open the paper and repeat these folds from the top corner again make the first kite fold again with the original side up and turn the paper over bring the side corners again to the center diagonal line from the top corner then again bring the free edge corners to the center diagonal line from the top corner and unfold fold along the other diagonal fold along the opposite diagonal that does not already have a crease along it forming a triangle and unfold pinch the corners together into a pleated diamond pinch the two corners at which you have just made the diagonal by pushing the edges up towards you then bring your hands together folding along the kite folds you made earlier the first kite fold crease should go down on each side the second up and the third down the corners that you are pinching should be sticking up it will look like a diamond with two pieces sticking up in the middle on each side push the two flaps down towards the top corner push the two flaps that are sticking up down along to the top corner it will now look like an arrowhead or like a kite with a point sticking out the top of it rotate the origami so that it is horizontal and turn it over rotate the origami dragon so that the corners point right and left the flaps that you just pushed down should be facing towards the right then turn the origami dragon upside down keeping it pointing in the same direction fold the bottom corner to the top corner along the center diagonal bring the bottom corner to the top corner along the centerline to fold the diamond in half lengthwise it will now look like a wide and short triangle bring the left corner up in between the two layers apply the inside reverse fold to bring the left corner up between the two edges you will have to slightly spread apart the top and bottom layers to pull the left corner up inside the two layers it should now have a piece sticking up on the left side of the paper while the middle and right side of the triangle are horizontal make the head using another inside reverse fold on the left side bring the corner down in between the two layers of the neck to create the head the head should be a bit less that half the length of the neck it will now look like a head with a pointy beak on the end bring the left corner down to the right along a diagonal and then back right along a diagonal to create the mouth bring the left corner down to the right about halfway down the length of the head this should be along a horizontal line so the corner point directly to the right then bring the corner from the right diagonally downward to the left to create the lower jaw there will now be a short piece hanging down creating the look of a jaw fold the wings down fold the flap in the middle of the dragon down from the right top corner to the bottom edge do the same in reverse on the opposite side to create the wings it will look like a swimming animal now because it will look like it has flippers open the wings to the sides open the wings

how to make a clay horse,crafting a clay horse is a great way to pay tribute the beloved animal and best of all you re left with your very own handmade figurine to play with or proudly display decide what kind of clay best suits your project and vision wear an apron and or clothes you don t mind getting dirty and get ready to sculpt,determine if the type of modeling clay is the best option for your project many modeling clays are oil based or wax based which means that they do not dry out in fact these clays can be exposed to air yet remain malleable for long periods of time allowing you both to move and reshape your creations at will and to preserve your pieces for long periods of time 1 x research source modeling clay is also sturdier than a material like play doh and typically holds its shape better making it easier to craft more detailed pieces 2 x research source note though that oil and wax based modeling clays cannot be hardened and painting these kinds of clay is not recommended 3 x research source if you would like to be able to paint on your clay horse polymer clay might work better for you prepare your work surface find a hard flat surface to work on oil based modeling clays can be messy and can leave greasy stains on uncovered work surfaces so depending on how clean you d like to keep that surface you may find it helpful to cover your workstation with newspaper wax paper or saran wrap decide how big you d like your sculpture to be based on what size of horse you d like to make your horse estimate how much clay you ll need if you are new to clay modeling you may want to avoid getting too overambitious with the scale of your horse instead start with a piece of clay that you can hold comfortably in one hand knead and warm your clay once you ve got the right amount of clay begin either squeezing it between your hands or place the clay on your work surface and knead it like bread dough continue squeezing or kneading until the clay is warm soft and easy to work with divide your clay into sections cut your clay into four pieces using a craft knife wire clay cutter or your hands one piece should be slightly larger than the the other three which should all be approximately the same size model the horse s neck and torso take your largest piece of clay and mold it into an oblong circle gently pinch one end of your oblong circle and pull it upwards to form your horse s neck since you ll want your horse s body to be able to support its head be sure not make the neck too long or too thin form your horse s head begin by mold one of your three equal sized clay pieces into a peanut shape next gently pinch one end of your peanut shape elongating it this will be your horse s nose and mouth create facial features using another one of your three equal sized sections craft two triangle shaped ears and two round eyes be sure to set aside some of this clay for your mane and tail though carefully attach your eyes and ears to the larger end of the horse s head finally attach your completed head to your horse s neck mold the horse s legs cut your third play doh section into four smaller pieces of equal size create long cylinder shaped legs by rolling each of these pieces between your fingers until they re a length and width that look proportionate in relation to your horse s torso the thickness and height of your legs will depend on whether or not you d like your horse to be able to stand upright thicker and shorter legs for instance will make for a sturdier base mold and attach your hooves break off a small piece of clay from one end of each cylinder to use for your hooves roll each hoof into a ball pinch each ball between your thumb and pointer finger making them into short cylinders attach one of these short cylinders to the bottom of each leg now attach two legs to front end of your horse s torso and two to the back end add a mane and tail break the last of your clay into smaller pieces and form these pieces into strands or chunks of hair to complete your horse attach your tail to the rear end of the horse s torso and your mane to the back of the horse s head and neck and between its ears decide if polymer clay is the material that best suits your project pieces made from polymer clay can be put in the oven to harden although you can also purchase air dry polymer clay making it a good choice if preserving your sculpture is important to you 4 x research source polymer clay can also be painted which is ideal if you are looking to create a more detailed clay model keep in mind that young children should never attempt to bake their polymer creations on their own adult supervision is always required when using an oven get your work surface ready find a hard flat surface to work on cover your work surface in newspaper if you are concerned with messiness figure out how much clay you ll need while the scale of your model is ultimately up to you remember that larger pieces will take longer to cure in the oven we suggest that you use an amount of clay that you can hold easily in the palm of one hand warm your clay to make your polymer clay as malleable as possible begin by squeezing it between your hands work your until the clay is warm soft and easy to work with you may also choose to place the clay on your work surface and knead it like bread dough separate your clay into four sections you can use your hands a craft knife or a wire clay cutter to divide your clay one of your four piece should be slightly larger than the rest and the remaining three sections should be of roughly equal size create your horse s neck and torso mold your largest piece of clay into an oblong circle now gently pinch one end of your oblong circle and pull it upwards to create a neck make sure the neck isn t too long or too thin if it is it won t be able to support your horse s head mold a head take one of your three equal sized clay pieces and turn it into a peanut shape next gently pinch one end of your peanut shape elongating it to make your horse s nose and mouth create and add eyes and ears using another one of your three equal sized sections create two triangle shaped ears and two round eyes but be sure to set aside some of this clay for your mane and tail carefully fasten the eyes and ears to the larger more round end of your horse s head now attach the head to your horse s neck mold legs for your horse cut your third play doh section into four smaller pieces of equal size roll each of these pieces between your fingers creating long cylinders legs until they re a length and width that you desire the thickness and height of your legs should reflect whether or not you d like your horse to be able to sturdily stand upright legs that are thicker and longer make for a sturdier base mold and attach your hooves break off a small piece of clay from one end of each leg to create your hooves roll each small piece into a ball pinch these balls between your thumb and pointer finger until they resemble short cylinders attach one of these short cylinders to the bottom of each leg now attach two legs to front end of your horse s torso and two to the back end use the last of your clay to make a mane and tail break the last of your clay into smaller pieces forming these pieces into strands or chunks of hair finish modeling your horse by attach your tail to the rear end of the horse s torso and your mane to the back of the horse s head and neck and between its ears you can omit the clay mane if you would prefer to paint one on after you ve cured your sculpture cure your polymer clay horse follow the packet instructions to ensure that you re baking your piece at the right temperature and for the correct amount of time temperatures used to cook polymer clay vary from 215 f 102 c to 325 f 163 c 5 x research source choose paints that are best suited for your polymer clay acrylic paint is generally recommended but if you first coat your piece with a glaze made for polymer clay e g sculpey glaze you may use almost any kind of paint 6 x research source again painting your horse is an entirely optional step decide what color or colors you d like to use for your horse many horses have spotted coats which can be fun and a little more challenging to paint than single colored coats remember too that while most horses found in nature are some shade of brown beige black or grey your artistic options are not as limited if pink is your favorite color and you would like your horse s coat or mane to be pink by all means go for it leave your painted piece to dry while many paints will dry in under half an hour you may want to wait a little longer if you d like to be on the safe side drying times may also vary depending on how thick a coat of paint you ve applied apply a coat of varnish coating your horse with a clear varnish will help ensure that the paint maintains a fresh look and doesn t chip 7 x research source be sure your paint has dried fully before you cover it with varnish and be sure that the brush you use for your varnish coat is clean decide if play doh is the best material for you play doh can be a great sculpting material particularly for younger artists but is not your best bet if you d like to create a more long lasting sculpture play doh is good for young sculptors because it is very soft and easy for small hands to mold play doh is also food safe making it a wise choice for curious toddlers who might try tasting their art supplies and is marketed as being safe for ages two and up 8 x research source unfortunately play doh will dry out and crack if left sitting out so be prepared for the fact that your piece may not remain intact or in good condition for long find a flat surface to work on while play doh is fairly easy to clean up covering your work station with newspaper can make the cleaning process easier 9 x research source determine the scale of your project decide how big you d like your horse to be and estimate much play doh you ll need accordingly in the interest of keeping your project manageable you may want to avoid getting too overambitious with the size of your model try starting with an amount of play doh that you can hold easily in one hand prepare your play doh to ensure that your play doh is as soft and easy to work with as possible squeeze it between your hands until it is warm if you are using old play doh that has begun to dry out try working a small amount of water into it to restore its pliability 10 x research source divide your play doh into sections using your hands break your play doh into four pieces making one piece slightly larger than the rest the other three pieces should be of roughly equal size model the horse s neck and torso take your largest piece of play doh and mold it into an oblong circle gently pinch one end of your oblong circle and pull it upwards to form your horse s neck since you ll want your horse s body to be able to support its head be sure not make the neck too long or too thin form your horse s head begin by mold one of your three equal sized clay pieces into a peanut shape gently pinch one end of your peanut shape elongating it to create the horse s nose and mouth create and attach facial features using another one of your three equal sized sections craft two triangle shaped ears and two round eyes but make sure to set aside some of this play doh section as you will need it later to make your mane and tail carefully attach your eyes and ears to the larger end of the horse s head and fasten your completed head to the horse s neck make the horse s legs divide your third play doh section into four smaller pieces of equal size roll each of these pieces between your fingers creating long cylinder shaped legs how thick you and short or how thin and tall you make your legs will depend on whether or not you d like your horse to be able to stand upright thicker and shorter legs will make for a sturdier base mold and attach your hooves break off a small piece of clay from one end of each cylinder to use for your hooves roll each hoof into a ball then pinch each ball between your thumb and pointer finger until they become short cylinders attach one of these short cylinders to the bottom of each leg then proceed to attach two legs to front end of your horse s torso and two to the back end add a mane and tail break the last of your play doh into smaller pieces and form these pieces into strands or chunks of hair attach your tail to the rear end of the horse s torso and your mane to the back of the horse s head and neck and between its ears allow your horse to dry and paint if desired play doh is an air drying clay so let your piece sit out until it hardens the drying process may take up to several days so have patience 11 x research source once your horse has dried you can add color and detail to your sculpture using either acrylic or poster paint this is optional 12 x

how to make a paper butterfly,paper butterflies are not only dainty and chic they re also fun to make try your hand at origami to create one or if you re more of a crafting beginner fold a simpler version with pretty pleats when you re finished use your butterflies as decor or give them to friends and family as gifts,fold the paper in half then open it and fold it in half the other way make sure to crease both of the folds line up the edges when you re folding to ensure the crease is directly in the center 1 x research source if your paper is the same color or pattern on both sides it doesn t matter which side you start on however if one side is white or the backside begin with that side facing up fold the paper in half diagonally open it and fold on the other diagonal bring 2 opposite corners together to create the folds press down firmly to create defined creases repeat on both diagonals open the paper to lie flat after you fold it 2 x research source your 4 folds should intersect in the exact center of the paper bring the right and left creases together creating a triangle with the paper laying flat in front of you press the right horizontal crease to the left one as you do this the paper should collapse onto itself in a triangle shape along the diagonal creases you made 3 x research source press down on the triangle to crease the paper once it s collapsed if the paper isn t folding properly go back over your original creases again if they aren t defined enough the paper will have trouble falling into the shape fold the 2 top corners into the center when you created the triangle shape it made 2 layers grab the corners on the top layer and line up their edges with the crease in the middle of the triangle 4 x research source try to align the corners with the crease perfectly so they aren t overlapping or so there isn t a large gap between the edges in the center flip the triangle over and fold the bottom up leaving a small tip showing you aren t folding it completely half instead you re folding it about 1 3 up from the base of the triangle hold the fold in place gently with your hand 5 x research source don t crease the fold bend the top layer of the tip over the base there are 2 layers at the tip of the triangle peel the top 1 forward folding it over the wide triangle bottom you re currently holding in place the tip will be the head of the butterfly 6 x research source crease the fold that you make with the tip this will help secure the body of the butterfly in place and prevent it from unraveling pull down the pieces from the bottom layer to create the lower wings with the top layer folded over bring the bottom layer of the tip in the opposite direction the points of the 2 triangular pieces should be facing down away from the folded head 7 x research source it may help to hold the folded tip with your thumb while you pull the other pieces down so that the butterfly doesn t come apart re crease the folded tip after you arrange the bottom pieces if necessary trim the edges of the wings if you want a smaller butterfly fold the square piece of paper in half creasing it line up the edges of the paper when you fold it to make sure you re creating a line directly down the middle press firmly with your fingernail to form the crease 8 x research source use any type of paper you d like whether it s origami paper colorful cardstock or even pretty gift wrap the size of your paper doesn t matter as long as it s square if you have a rectangular piece simply trim it down so all of the edges are the same length unfold the paper and cut along the crease line use your scissors to cut the piece of paper in half the groove of the crease should help guide your scissors in a straight line through the paper 9 x research source make sure your scissors are sharp so they don t tear or crinkle the paper if you have trouble cutting in a line hold your scissors against a straight edge like a ruler while you cut make accordion folds with one of the pieces of the paper fold a small piece lengthwise then flip the paper over to fold it back onto itself continue flipping the paper from side to side as you fold along the entire length of the paper think of this motion as similar to making a pleat or a fan 10 x research source you can make the folds as thick or as thin as you d like keep the folds all the same thickness no matter what size you choose take the other piece of paper you cut and fold it in half lengthwise place the 2 longer edges on top of each other then create a crease by pressing down along the fold 11 x research source try to make the crease as straight and even as possible so it splits the paper directly in half open it up and fold the 4 corners in toward the center crease line line up the edges straight along the crease your paper will now be in the shape of a hexagon with 2 pointed ends formed by the folded corners 12 x research source leave the corners folded if they won t stay in place use a piece of double sided tape or a little bit of glue under the flap flip the paper over and make accordion folds on each side of the crease fold one half the paper in towards the center then repeat on the other side this will be the top half of the butterfly s wings 13 x research source make the folds as large or as small as you d like depending on the size of your paper bend both pieces of pleated paper in half press the pleats together and hold the paper between your thumb and forefinger carefully fold one end onto the other creasing it firmly 14 x research source the paper won t stay folded but that s okay you just want to make a crease so the paper is in a v shape place 1 piece above the other and tie them together at the center arrange the 2 pieces so that they form a butterfly shape pinch them together while you tie string or cord around both pieces 15 x research source to secure the 2 pieces together better you can add a dab of craft glue or hot glue in the middle having a friend hold the pieces together while you tie the string makes it easier to get a tight knot you can also use ribbon or a pipe cleaner instead of string pull out the pleats to open up the wings scrunched up folds don t exactly resemble a beautiful butterfly gently pull the pleats apart so that the 2 pieces of paper look like 1 large wing on each side instead of 2 disjointed ones 16 x research source be careful not to rip the paper when you re arranging the pleats,Pets-and-Animals
how to crochet a butterfly,crocheted butterflies make great pins and appliques for crochet projects you can easily make a butterfly by creating a ruffled circle and then folding it in half and using a chain to form the butterfly s body then you can embellish your butterfly with antennae to make it look even more realistic try making a butterfly for yourself or for a friend,chain six and join in a circle to start making your butterfly make a chain of six stitches then insert the hook into the first stitch and slipstitch to connect the ends this will create a chain circle and you will be working your stitches into the center of this circle 1 x research source to make the first chain yarn over the hook twice and then pull the first loop through the second then loop the yarn over again pull through the other loop continue until you have six stitches 2 x research source to slipstitch insert the hook into the end of the chain then yarn over and pull it through both loops 3 x research source chain three and double crochet twice into the center to begin working into the center make a chain of three stitches then double crochet twice into the center of the circle this will complete one cluster of double crochet stitches and you will need to make a total of eight clusters or 16 double crochet stitches 4 x research source to double crochet yarn over the hook then insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over the hook again next pull the yarn through the first stitch and then yarn over again pull the yarn through the next two stitches on the hook then yarn over the hook again then pull the yarn through the last two stitches on your hook 5 x research source chain two and double crochet twice into center again after your first two double crochet stitches make a chain of two then double crochet twice into the center again 6 x research source continue to chain two and double crochet two into the center all the way around the circle you should have a total of 16 double crochet stitches when you reach the end chain two and connect with a slipstitch to finish the first round chain two after your last cluster of double crochet stitches then use a slipstitch to connect the chain of two to the top of the chain of three that you made at the beginning of the round 7 x research source switch your yarn switch to your other color for the outside of the wing to do this cut the yarn a few inches from your hook and pull it through the stitch to secure it then tie the new yarn around the space where the old yarn was connected then begin working with the new yarn color 8 x research source you will have two loose ends that you will need to work into the next round to hide them to do this lay them along the stitches that you will be working with next and then crochet around them double crochet six times into the chain two space to begin the next round you will need to double crochet into the chain two space six times this will create a scalloped edge around your circle 9 x research source slipstitch after the sixth double crochet after you complete your sixth double crochet stitch use a slipstitch to connect the last stitch this will help to create the scalloped effect for the double crochet stitches 10 x research source repeat this sequence all the way around the circle when you reach the end you should have eight scallops slipstitch into first stitch to finish the round after you have finished all eight scallops you will need to connect the first and last scallops use a slipstitch to join the first and last stitches in the round 11 x research source chain eight at this point your work will look like a ruffled doily to make it look like a butterfly you will need to secure it down the middle make a chain of eight stitches extending from the circle 12 x research source fold the circle in half and wrap the chain around it next fold the chain in half then wrap the chain around the center of the folded circle to secure it the chain running down the center of the folded circle will resemble the body of the butterfly 13 x research source secure the chain with a slipstitch to secure the chain insert your hook into the first chain and then yarn over and pull the yarn through the stitch cut the yarn a few inches away from the hook and then pull it trough to create a knot 14 x research source sew in the tail you will have a bit of excess yarn extending from the end so you will need to sew it in thread the yarn through the needle s eye and then sew the tail through the edge a few times to secure it then snip the excess 15 x research source create the antennae to make little antennae for your butterfly cut a small piece of yarn a few inches long in the same color as the butterfly s body then tie a knot into each end of the yarn you can snip the excess closer to the knot if you cannot get the knots right on the end then slide the yarn under the chain at the top of the butterfly s body and then pull until the antennae are even 16 x research source,Pets-and-Animals

how to make a painted paper butterfly,butterflies come in all sorts of shapes sizes and colors they are pretty to look at but they can be hard to catch luckily it s possible to make your own butterfly with paint and paper with a little bit of creativity and a few extra supplies you can come up with a truly unique butterfly,crease a sheet of white paper down the middle fold your paper in half widthwise or hamburger style then unfold it the crease down the middle will be your guide 1 x research source the paper needs to have a smooth texture so something like cardstock printer paper or even a plain paper plate will all work do not use construction paper it will soak up the paint the size of the paper does not matter although larger pieces are easier to work with choose 2 to 3 colors pf paint you can use acrylic craft paint tempera paint or poster paint make sure that these colors look nice together especially when mixed for example red yellow and orange are a great combination blue pink and purple is another combination that works well don t use opposite colors such as red and green or you will get brown you can use white as 1 of your colors this will give you a pastel look use glittery or metallic paint as 1 of your colors if you want to give your butterfly extra sparkle 2 x research source drop 2 to 3 blobs of paint using your first color you can squirt the paint directly from the bottle or you can drop the paint with a spoon instead 3 x research source place some of the blobs closer to the crease and others further from the crease don t put the paint too close to the edge of the paper or it will squirt out when you squish it 4 x research source add a few more blobs using your other colors make 2 to 3 blobs using the other colors keep the blobs close together if they are too far apart they won t blend together and create a butterfly don t use too much paint or the paper will get soggy if you are starting to see more paint than white paper stop fold your paper back in half then press on it don t pick up the paper simply fold the left side over onto the right just like closing a book press on the paper with your fingers to squish the paint around you may feel the paint moving through the paper which is fine 5 x research source unfold the paper and let the paint dry each time you do this project you will get a different shape and combinations of colors sometimes the shapes look like butterflies and sometimes they look like something else 6 x research source set the paper aside so that it can dry this can take as little as 15 minutes to as long as an hour if your butterfly doesn t look like a butterfly at all you can cut the paper into a butterfly shape click here to learn how to turn painted paper into a cut out butterfly 7 x research source add a body and antennae if desired paint the body black or glue a row of black pompoms down the middle instead use a thin paintbrush and black paint to add 2 antennae above the butterfly s head you can also draw the antenna on with glitter glue instead make your butterfly fancier by decorating the wings with glitter glue and or rhinestones glue 2 googly eyes to the head if you want a silly butterfly squirt 2 to 3 colors of paint onto a sheet of white paper you can use acrylic craft paint tempera paint or poster paint cardstock or printer paper will work the best but you can use a paper plate too don t use construction paper as it will soak the paint up too much 8 x research source spread the paint around to cover the entire paper you can do this with a paintbrush or a sponge brush make sure that the different colors of paint touch but don t mix them together too much or you will get a solid color you want a sort of tie dye effect 9 x research source if you run out of paint simply squirt more on you want to cover as much of the paper as possible let the paper dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes this should not take very long at all about 15 to 20 minutes if the paper is taking too long to dry you can speed the process up with a hair dryer or by setting the paper out in the sun fold the paper in half widthwise or hamburger style bring the narrow ends of the paper together then flatten the paper it does not matter if the paint is on the outside or on the inside draw half of a butterfly on the paper with the body along the fold you can make up your own butterfly shape or you can use a stencil template you can make 1 big butterfly or you can make several smaller butterflies if you are making more than 1 butterfly make sure that they are all on the fold 10 x research source cut the paper along the line that you drew if you drew on the painted side of the paper make sure that you cut just inside the lines this way they won t show up when you finish your butterfly unfold the butterfly and decorate it if desired you can leave your butterfly the way it is or you can decorate it further with paint glue and other items if you do decide to decorate your butterfly make sure that you let it dry before moving on here are some decorating ideas glue pompoms down the middle for the body you can also use black paint instead fold a pipe cleaner into a v then glue it behind the head for the antenna glue tiny googly eyes to the head to make a face you can also paint eyes on instead paint designs onto the wings with black or white paint or glitter glue glue gemstones to the wings to make them sparkle thread string through the butterfly so that you can hang it up use a needle to thread some string through the top of the butterfly tie the ends of the string together so that you can hang it if you made many small butterflies you can thread them onto a longer piece of string and use them as a garland instead paint a slotted wooden clothespin with black or brown acrylic paint use a paintbrush with synthetic bristles to apply black or brown acrylic craft paint to the clothespin then let the paint dry this should only take about 15 to 20 minutes 11 x research source if you can t find craft paint you can use tempera paint or poster paint instead slotted clothespins look like dolls they have a round head a narrow neck and 2 thin legs they do not open and close like regular clothespins if you don t have clothespins use a craft stick instead you only need to paint 1 side 12 x research source paint a piece of white paper 2 to 3 different watercolors choose 2 to 3 different colors of watercolor and apply them to the paper in blobs with a watercolor brush let the colors flow together to create a tie dye effect choose colors that look nice when mixed together such as blue pink and purple 13 x research source don t use contrasting colors such as red and green or you may get brown where they mix construction paper will work the best but you can use printer paper too watercolor brushes are soft and made from camelhair don t use stiff brushes because they don t pick up enough paint set the paper aside so that it can dry this can take a few hours so you can do something else in the meantime if you can t wait you can dry the paper with a hairdryer or leave it out in the hot sun for a bit how long the paint takes to dry depends on what type of paper you used how wet you made it and so forth fold the paper into a fan starting from the narrow end fold the narrow edge down by 1 2 inch 1 3 cm turn the paper over and fold the edge down by another 1 2 inch 1 3 cm keep doing this until you reach the other end of the paper 14 x research source you can make the folds smaller than 1 2 inch 1 3 cm but don t make them bigger if you used a craft stick fold the paper in half and cut out a butterfly shape instead place the body of the butterfly on the fold 15 x research source slide the fan into the clothespin hold the fan by the middle and turn it so that the edges open up like a bowtie pinch the middle of the fan and slide it up into the slot on the clothespin you ll get something that looks like if you get something that looks like the fan is turned the wrong way 16 x research source secure the fan inside the clothespin with glue hot glue will work the best but you can use thick tacky glue too if you used a craft stick glue the cut out butterfly to the back of the stick the painted side of the paper needs to be facing up with the stick down the middle 17 x research source glue some googly eyes onto the head of the clothespin place 2 tiny drops of tacky glue hot glue or white school glue onto the round part of the clothespin next press 2 tiny googly eyes into the glue then let the glue dry 18 x research source make sure that you are gluing the eyes to the front of the butterfly if you don t have googly eyes you can use tiny buttons or pompoms instead make sure that they are small enough to fit on the head part of the clothespin wrap a pipecleaner around the neck to make the antenna make a v shape with a pipe cleaner wrap it around the neck of the clothespin just below the round head twist the pipe cleaner once or twice so that it holds 19 x research source black will be the most realistic but you can use any color you want if you are using a craft stick fold the pipe cleaner in half to make a v then hot glue it to the back of the stick shape the antenna into a v then curl the ends open up the pipe cleaner to make a v cut the ends down if you think they are too long use your finger a pen or a pencil to curl the ends of the pipe cleaner into spirals 20 x research source,Pets-and-Animals

how to frame butterflies,have you ever wondered about how people frame their butterflies whether you are just curious or you want to do this as a hobby this will get you started,if your butterfly is dried out you will need a large jar to put it in in the base of the jar put some window screen in it and under the window screen put cotton balls soaked in water with a drop of carbolic acid the water will keep moist and acid will keep it from molding tightly seal your jar and put it away for about a week get yourself a deep picture frame like a shadow box place batting fake cotton within it nice and thick place a mothball in the very top corner as snug as you can get it if this is not done you will risk the chance of getting dermestid larvae inside of your picture and it will ruin the entire picture once you have the mothball in the corner place your butterfly down onto the batting and place your glass on top of it put together the back of your frame and seal up the edges and corners with tape every few years replace that mothball,Pets-and-Animals
how to make butterfly wings,butterfly wings make great costumes and are fun to make use cardstock or wire hangers and stockings to make the wings and then attach straps so that you can easily wear them if you want to make your wings look colourful and bright paint pretty designs on them this craft is quick easy and only requires basic craft items,draw the outline of butterfly wings onto a large piece of cardstock try to make your wing as symmetrical as possible as this helps them to look realistic draw the wings as little or as big as you like if you don t feel very confident drawing butterfly wings search online for a template and then print it out 1 x research source if you prefer you can use paper instead of cardstock these wings aren t as sturdy but they look very similar the amount of cardstock that you will need will depend on what sized wings you want however a 1 metre 39 in square will most likely be more than enough use a craft knife to cut out the butterfly wings place the cardstock onto a cutting board and carefully cut out the butterfly wings with a craft knife try to cut just inside the lines as this means that you won t see the pen marks on the butterfly wings 2 x research source ask a parent to help you to cut out the butterfly wings as craft knives can be dangerous cut four 1 centimetre 0 39 in holes into the middle of the butterfly wings use a craft knife to cut 2 holes side by side approximately 2 centimetres 0 79 in apart then cut 2 more holes 2 centimetres 0 79 in underneath these holes allow you to attach the straps to the butterfly wings 3 x research source it doesn t matter if the holes aren t perfectly in the middle of the butterfly just use your best judgement paint the front of the butterfly wings if desired place the butterfly wings onto scrap paper to protect your work surface from paint paint the butterfly wings a solid colour or give it stripes or spots be creative and use your imagination 4 x research source water based paints are a great option as they can easily be washed out of clothes however oil paints and acrylic paints will also work wait 2 hours for the paint to dry and then paint the other side place your painting in a safe dry spot away from animals or children once it is dry turn it over and paint the other side so that the back facing side of the wings doesn t look bare when you wear them 5 x research source if you want to add extra decoration to your butterfly wings stick on sequins glitter tissue paper stickers or beads if the paint is still wet after 2 hours allow it to dry for another hour or until it feels dry to touch thread the tips of a 2 m 79 in rope through the 2 top holes thread the rope through the side of the wings that you painted first the side that will face outward from your back pull the rope so that it is even on both sides this creates a loop through the forward facing side of the butterfly wings 6 x research source if the rope won t fit through the holes burn the ends of the rope to make the tips pointier ask an adult to help you with this this rope creates straps that allow the wings to be easily worn push the tips back to the forward facing side through the bottom holes this helps to create straps that look similar to those on a backpack push the right end of the rope through the bottom right hole and the left end of the rope through the bottom left hole 7 x research source tuck the tips of the rope under the top loop of rope this helps to secure the rope in place and makes your butterfly look like it has antennas if the rope is too long simply cut it to your desired length with a pair of scissors 8 x research source the pressure of the holes against the rope will likely keep the rope in place however if the straps come undone try tying the ends of the rope into a double knot bend 2 wire hangers into the shape of butterfly wings leave the hook portion of the hanger intact and then use your fingers to push and pull the rest of the wire into the shape of a wing try to make the 2 wings as similar as possible as this helps them to look more realistic 9 x research source if you are having trouble bending the wire use a pair of pliers to help you pull each of the hooks into a circle shape this helps to stop the wire from poking out and hurting the person wearing the wings if there is enough wire wrap it around the base of the hook to secure it in place 10 x research source if you are struggling to bend the wire use pliers to help shape it push each wing into the leg of a stocking push the wings into the stockings very slowly to help prevent them ripped if the stocking gets stuck on a bump in the wire simply pull the stocking up and over the bump to stop it from getting torn keep pushing until the entire wing is inside the stocking 11 x research source in some countries stockings are called pantyhose knot each end of the stocking close to the hanger tie a knot in 1 end of the stocking and then pull the stocking tight and knot the other end as close to the hanger as you can this pulls the stockings taut over the wire and makes them look like wings trim off any excess stocking with a pair of scissors 12 x research source repeat this process on both wings wrap the hooks of the wings together to form the middle of the wings place 1 hook on top of the other then completely cover the wire with heavy duty sticky tape this helps to prevent the wire on the hooks from digging into your back when you wear the wings 13 x research source place elastic loops over each wing knot 2 lengths of 50 centimetres 20 in elastic to form an elastic loop stretch each loop of elastic over the wings of the butterfly so that they sit in the middle section of the butterfly these elastic loops act as armbands for the wings 14 x research source put the elastic loops on the same way that you would put on backpack straps it doesn t matter where exactly the elastic loops sit as the extruding wings will keep them in the middle of the butterfly paint the butterfly wings if desired this is a great way to make your butterfly wings look unique consider painting stripes dots or patterns on your wings to make them stand out leave the wings to dry for about 2 hours before wearing them 15 x research source paint your wings orange and black to make them look like a monarch butterfly fabric paint works best for this method however water based paints and acrylic paints will also work,Pets-and-Animals
how to crochet a butterfly,crocheted butterflies make great pins and appliques for crochet projects you can easily make a butterfly by creating a ruffled circle and then folding it in half and using a chain to form the butterfly s body then you can embellish your butterfly with antennae to make it look even more realistic try making a butterfly for yourself or for a friend,chain six and join in a circle to start making your butterfly make a chain of six stitches then insert the hook into the first stitch and slipstitch to connect the ends this will create a chain circle and you will be working your stitches into the center of this circle 1 x research source to make the first chain yarn over the hook twice and then pull the first loop through the second then loop the yarn over again pull through the other loop continue until you have six stitches 2 x research source to slipstitch insert the hook into the end of the chain then yarn over and pull it through both loops 3 x research source chain three and double crochet twice into the center to begin working into the center make a chain of three stitches then double crochet twice into the center of the circle this will complete one cluster of double crochet stitches and you will need to make a total of eight clusters or 16 double crochet stitches 4 x research source to double crochet yarn over the hook then insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over the hook again next pull the yarn through the first stitch and then yarn over again pull the yarn through the next two stitches on the hook then yarn over the hook again then pull the yarn through the last two stitches on your hook 5 x research source chain two and double crochet twice into center again after your first two double crochet stitches make a chain of two then double crochet twice into the center again 6 x research source continue to chain two and double crochet two into the center all the way around the circle you should have a total of 16 double crochet stitches when you reach the end chain two and connect with a slipstitch to finish the first round chain two after your last cluster of double crochet stitches then use a slipstitch to connect the chain of two to the top of the chain of three that you made at the beginning of the round 7 x research source switch your yarn switch to your other color for the outside of the wing to do this cut the yarn a few inches from your hook and pull it through the stitch to secure it then tie the new yarn around the space where the old yarn was connected then begin working with the new yarn color 8 x research source you will have two loose ends that you will need to work into the next round to hide them to do this lay them along the stitches that you will be working with next and then crochet around them double crochet six times into the chain two space to begin the next round you will need to double crochet into the chain two space six times this will create a scalloped edge around your circle 9 x research source slipstitch after the sixth double crochet after you complete your sixth double crochet stitch use a slipstitch to connect the last stitch this will help to create the scalloped effect for the double crochet stitches 10 x research source repeat this sequence all the way around the circle when you reach the end you should have eight scallops slipstitch into first stitch to finish the round after you have finished all eight scallops you will need to connect the first and last scallops use a slipstitch to join the first and last stitches in the round 11 x research source chain eight at this point your work will look like a ruffled doily to make it look like a butterfly you will need to secure it down the middle make a chain of eight stitches extending from the circle 12 x research source fold the circle in half and wrap the chain around it next fold the chain in half then wrap the chain around the center of the folded circle to secure it the chain running down the center of the folded circle will resemble the body of the butterfly 13 x research source secure the chain with a slipstitch to secure the chain insert your hook into the first chain and then yarn over and pull the yarn through the stitch cut the yarn a few inches away from the hook and then pull it trough to create a knot 14 x research source sew in the tail you will have a bit of excess yarn extending from the end so you will need to sew it in thread the yarn through the needle s eye and then sew the tail through the edge a few times to secure it then snip the excess 15 x research source create the antennae to make little antennae for your butterfly cut a small piece of yarn a few inches long in the same color as the butterfly s body then tie a knot into each end of the yarn you can snip the excess closer to the knot if you cannot get the knots right on the end then slide the yarn under the chain at the top of the butterfly s body and then pull until the antennae are even 16 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to make tissue paper butterflies,butterflies are a wonderful part of spring and summer tissue paper is perfect for making them because of how light bright and fluttery it can be there are lots of different ways of making them from simple clothespin butterflies to colorful ones that look like stained glass whichever method you choose you are bound to end up with lots of colorful butterflies to decorate your home with,cut three 10 inch 25 4 centimeters squares out of a sheet of tissue paper for a more colorful butterfly cut each square from a different color this will make the wings 1 x research source to save time stack the papers first and then cut them all at once stack the papers one on top of each other make sure that the corners and edges are aligned if you are using more than one color stack them in an order that you like fold the paper accordion style until you have a 1 inch 2 54 centimeters thick strip fold the bottom edge up by 1 inch 2 54 centimeters flip the paper over and fold it up by another inch 2 54 centimeters keep flipping and folding in this manner until you get a fan or accordion keep the papers together while you are folding them treat them as one sheet of paper consider cutting a small notch or v shape into each end of the folded fan accordion this will give your butterfly a more interesting design clip a wooden clothespin onto the center of the folded paper make sure that you are clipping the clothespin onto the folded edges of the folded paper and not the top flat part the paper will scrunch up a little but that is okay when you open it up you ll have beautiful wings open up the wings to either side of the clothes pin the wings should be sticking out to either side of the clothespin just like the wings of a butterfly if they open up more like an umbrella instead simply twist and rotate them until they are facing the right way if you d like you can gently fluff the wings up too make the antenna out of a pipe cleaner fold a pipe cleaner in half into a v shape curl each end into a small o shape or a tight spiral 2 x research source clip the antenna into the clothespin position it just above the folded tissue paper everything should be fitted snugly in the groove part of the clothespin decorate the clothespin body you can color it with markers or with paints you can even glue on tiny googly eyes or draw a silly face to make an extra fancy butterfly decorate the body with glitter glue and rhinestones fold a sheet of black construction paper in half widthwise and draw half of a butterfly 3 x research source don t make the butterfly too small it should be almost the same size as the paper also make sure that the body of the butterfly is aligned with folded part of the paper this makes the outer part of your frame use a white crayon or colored pencil so that you can see the line easily you can make up your own butterfly or find a template online to use 4 x research source cut the butterfly out following the lines that you drew keep the folded while you cut this way when you unfold your paper your butterfly will look the same on both sides cut out the inside of the butterfly ½ to 1 inch 1 27 to 2 54 centimeters from the outline 5 x research source when you unfold your butterfly you should have an outline of a butterfly the wings should be hollow this will make the inner part of the frame if you d like your butterfly to have a solid black body only cut out inside the wings don t extend the frame to the fold place the butterfly frame down on a sheet of clear contact paper cut a sheet of contact paper a little bit bigger than the butterfly peel off the backing and set it down on the table sticky side up place the butterfly frame down onto the contact paper 6 x research source cut the tissue paper into squares make them between 1 to 2 inches 2 54 to 5 08 centimeters use lots of different colors to make your butterfly look more interesting you can even cut some of the squares into rectangles inside stick the tissue paper onto the wings the tissue paper will stick to the contact paper so you don t have to use any glue this will create the stained glass effect if you cut out a hollow body stick the tissue paper onto there as well cover the butterfly with another sheet of contact paper make sure that the contact paper is large enough to cover the entire butterfly peel off the backing and slowly place it over the butterfly going from one side to the next smooth it down with your hands or a ruler to seal it cut around the butterfly leave a ¼ inch 0 64 centimeters boarder of contact paper around the butterfly to seal it in and keep it from coming apart hang your butterfly in a bright window punch a hole through one of the wings and thread a piece of thread through it tie the thread into a loop and hang it someplace where the light will shine through it 7 x research source you can also tape the butterfly to a window if you won t want to punch a hole through its wings the side with the black outline is the front and the tissue paper side is the back cut out your butterfly template out of a sheet of paper fold a sheet of paper in half sketch out half of a butterfly and then cut it out this will make your template which you will be basing the rest of your butterflies on it will make your garland more consistent 8 x research source make the butterfly no more than 6 inches 15 24 centimeters tall you should only draw and cut the wings don t worry about the body you will be making it out of pipe cleaner later fold a stack of tissue paper in half and tuck it inside the folded butterfly like a hot dog make sure that the folded part of the tissue paper is nestled against the folded part of the butterfly you will be cutting the tissue paper one color at a time then arranging and assembling the colors later on cut the tissue paper using your template as a guide take the cut tissue paper butterflies out of the template and unfold them set them down in a neat pile and move on to the next color you will need three different colors make the bodies of the butterflies using pipe cleaners cut the pipe cleaners in half using a pair of pliers or wire cutters bend each cut pipe cleaner in half you will get two butterflies out of one pipe cleaner cut and fold as many as you need stack three tissue paper butterflies one of top of each other to save time make all of your stacks now so that they will be all ready for you you can stack the colors in the same order or alternate them you can also make some butterflies all one color tuck the stack inside one of the bent pipe cleaners and twist it shut scrunch the middle of the butterfly slightly then slide it into the bent pipe cleaner measure up about half way up the pipe cleaner and twist it twice this closes the body 9 x research source if you don t wish to use these butterflies on a garden you are finished gently spread the antenna apart and curl each end for that final touch gently fluff the wings up this will give your butterflies are more fluttery appearance be careful so that you don t pull the wings out of the pipe cleaner body attach the butterflies to the garland measure out your twine and slide it between the butterfly s antenna twist the antenna one to two more times then spread them apart in a v shape if you d like you can curl the ends of the antenna at this point 10 x research source keep assembling and attach your butterflies until you have as many as you like on your garland when you are done hang the garland wherever you like such as across a doorway or window,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a caterpillar,a caterpillar is a cute fuzzy creature that turns into a beautiful butterfly best of all there are lots of ways to make them using supplies from around your home caterpillar crafts are a great hands on way to teach young children about them while the children make their caterpillars you can read to them about caterpillars then hold a discussion afterwards,cut an egg carton in half lengthwise with scissors or a serrated knife you will end up with two long rows of egg cups pick the one you want and set the other one aside be sure to tear off the lid and front flaps so that you have just the strip 1 x research source you can use any size egg carton you want the more eggs it holds the longer your caterpillar will be a cardboard egg carton will work better than the foam kind because it is easier to paint paint the outside of the carton with acrylic poster or tempera paint green is the most popular caterpillar color but you can make yours any color you want to make a very hungry caterpillar paint the first cup red for the head then paint the rest green 2 x research source let the paint dry before moving on you can paint the inside of the carton but you need to let the outside dry first poke two holes on top of the first cup for the antenna the holes need to be right next to the narrow edge use a pen pencil or skewer to poke the holes it would be a good idea to ask an adult to help you with this step poke a pipe cleaner up through the holes turn the carton so that you can see the inside stick each end of a pipe cleaner through one of the holes flip the carton over and tug on both ends of the pipe cleaner so that it s even the pipe cleaner can be any color yellow will work the best but you can use black too secure trim and shape the antenna twist the antenna together once or twice then spread them open in a v use scissors to cut the antenna shorter then glue a mini pompom to the top of each one you can use any color of pompom you want red would work well with yellow pipe cleaners 3 x research source hot glue will work the best but you can use tacky glue as well hold the pompoms in place for about 30 seconds to help them stick if you don t have pompoms curl the ends of the antenna with a pencil instead add a face glue some googly eyes to the front of the first cup just below the antenna hold them down for about 30 seconds this will help them stick better 4 x research source next use a marker to draw on a mouth if you can t find googly eyes you can draw them on instead for a girly caterpillar add rosy cheeks and lashes for a silly caterpillar glue a small red pompom to the middle of the face for the nose decorate the caterpillar your caterpillar is done but you can make it look more colorful and interesting by adding some details here are some ideas draw on the caterpillar with glitter glue paint some polka dots or stripes onto the caterpillar stick foam stickers onto the caterpillar add a bow to the top of the head gather your pompoms they are all the same color or you can use different colors you can have them all be the same size or you can use one large pompom for the head 5 x research source to make a very hungry caterpillar try different shades of green for the body and a large red pompom for the head for a regular caterpillar use 7 pompoms 6 x research source for a puppet caterpillar use 11 pompoms 7 x research source glue the pompoms together to make a rope you can glue the pompoms together with hot glue or glue dots 8 x research source you can also use fabric glue or tacky glue but you will need to wait for the glue to dry an older child thread a needle with embroidery thread then string the pom poms onto the thread be sure to knot the thread securely at both ends 9 x research source glue googly eyes onto the first pompom you can use hot glue tacky glue or fabric glue if you are using tacky glue hold the eyes in place for about 30 seconds to help them stick let the glue dry before moving on add some antenna cut two short pieces of pipe cleaner glue each piece to the top of the caterpillar s head you can have them stick straight up or make them angle outward like a v hot glue will work the best but you can use fabric glue or tacky glue let the glue dry before moving on an older child can thread a needle then pull two short pieces of colored embroidery thread up through the bottom of the caterpillar s head 10 x research source turn the caterpillar into a puppet if desired cut two long pieces of fishing line tie one string to the third pompom and the other string to the seventh pompom next tie both strings to a short stick or dowel tilt the stick up and down like a seesaw to make the caterpillar move 11 x research source get a colorful knee sock it can be any color or pattern you want but make sure that it s clean striped socks work the best for this you can also use a crew sock instead for a smaller caterpillar don t use an ankle sock though it won t be long enough consider using a soft fuzzy sock for a fluffy caterpillar 12 x research source stuff the sock with polyester stuffing if you can t find any you can use cotton balls or scraps of yarn 13 x research source you can also use six 3 inch 7 62 centimeter styrofoam balls if you are using styrofoam balls you may not fit all of them into the sock don t try to cram them in 14 x research source tie the end of the sock with a rubber band or piece of yarn if the sock was very long you may still have some leftover cut the extra sock off so that you have a 2 inch 5 08 centimeter stub 15 x research source if you are using styrofoam balls leave enough space in the sock so that the balls can wiggle tie more rubber bands around the sock to create segments you can also use pieces of colorful yarn instead plan on having about six segments if you used styrofoam balls tie a rubber band piece of yarn between each ball 16 x research source glue googly eyes to the toe part of the sock turn the sock caterpillar so that the toe part is facing you glue two googly eyes on top right above the seam hot glue or tacky glue will work the best you can also use a hot glue with an adult s help add a face you can use the seam on the toe part as a mouth you can also draw your own mouth with a marker if you want to you can add some more details such as rosy cheeks or eyelashes for a silly caterpillar glue a small pompom onto the face for the nose for a rustic touch use buttons instead of googly eyes you can sew or glue them on tie a pipe cleaner around the neck for the antenna the neck is the first joint behind the head find the middle of a pipe cleaner then place it under the caterpillar wrap both ends around the neck then twist them together once or twice 17 x research source shape the antenna pull the antenna apart to make a v shape curl each end downward with a pencil 18 x research source you can also cut the antenna shorter and hot glue a mini pompom to the tips decorate the caterpillar you don t have to do this if you don t want to decorating the caterpillar will give it character and make it look more interesting here are some ideas draw designs with markers or puffy paint sew or glue buttons onto the caterpillar to make spots make a small bow out of ribbon and glue it onto the caterpillar s head glue a pompom onto the tail end to help hide the stub cut an empty toilet paper roll into four rings if you don t have any toilet paper rolls cut a paper towel roll in half and use that instead if you don t have any rolls at all do the following 19 x research source cut three 1½ inch 3 81 centimeter wide strips out of green paper cut a 1½ inch 3 81 centimeter wide strips out of red paper roll each strip into a ring secure each with a staple do not link or connect the rings paint the inside and outside of each ring you can use acrylic poster or tempera paint for this to make a very hungry caterpillar you will need three green rings and one red ring 20 x research source if you made the rings out of green paper skip this step glue or staple the rings together side by side glue all of the rings together in a row with the side curved edges touching glue the red ring to the end of the row to make the head you will have something that looks like this oooo keep the rings straight if they are crooked the caterpillar won t stand add some eyes you can draw the eyes one with a black marker or you can glue on a pair of googly eyes to make a very hungry caterpillar do the following 21 x research source cut two small ovals out of yellow paper cut two smaller ovals out of green paper glue the green ovals onto the yellow ovals to make the pupils glue the yellow ovals onto the caterpillar s head draw on a mouth if desired use a black marker to draw a simple smile in the middle of the face just below the eyes 22 x research source cut and fold a pipe cleaner in half for the antenna cut a pipe cleaner in half first set one of the halves aside for another project fold the remaining half into a v shape 23 x research source for a very hungry caterpillar use a purple pipe cleaner glue the antenna to the caterpillar s neck fill the space between the red ring and the first green ring with glue set the antenna into the glue pointy side down hold it there until the glue dries if you can t wait that long use a hot glue gun instead 24 x research source let the caterpillar dry once the caterpillar is dry you can stand it up on its side if it keeps falling over place some double sided tape on the bottom then stand it back up again the tape will stick to your desk and keep the caterpillar steady,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a toilet paper roll caterpillar,toilet paper caterpillars are a great way to entertain children for next to nothing these cardboard creatures are easy to make and lots of fun to play with making them suitable for teachers and parents to make with children,cut each toilet paper roll in half make a total of eight halves punch two holes in six of the tubes one in front and one in back the other two tubes will be the head and tail so only punch one hole in each of these paint the tubes any color you like thread the piece of yarn through each of the holes in each of the tubes leave the yarn somewhat loose so that your caterpillar can move with ease tie off the ends of the yarn on the tail and head pick out some construction paper and cut out two strips to use as antennae fold and glue the antennae onto the top of the caterpillar s head glue two googly eyes on the caterpillar s head the caterpillar is now complete and ready to have some fun,Pets-and-Animals
how to make handprint butterflies,using handprints is a great way to teach art to young crafters you can make all sorts of things using handprints including birds and butterflies butterflies are a kid favorite because they get to decorate them later on two of the most popular ways to make handprint butterflies are with paint and paper,paint your hand a bright color use a paintbrush or a foam brush to apply a thick coat of paint to your palm and fingers you can use tempera or poster paint press your hand against a sheet of paper to make a print point your palm towards the middle of the paper and your fingers to the side keep your fingers closed for a simple butterfly or spread them open for a fancier one you can use any type of paper you want white printer paper works just as well as construction paper try blue construction paper it ll look like your butterfly is on the sky make a second handprint with your other hand wash the paint off of your hand first then paint your other hand with the same color make a second handprint right next to the first one with the palms touching make another set of prints if you want a fancier butterfly the thumbs on your first set will be pointing upwards the thumbs on your second set should be pointing down have the palms on all prints meet in the middle you can use the same color of paint as before or a different one use the side of your hand and more paint for the body paint the side of your palm and pinky with black or brown paint press it against the paper right between the wings to make the body of the butterfly 1 x research source you can also make the body by painting your thumb and making a row of dots 2 x research source use your thumb and more paint for the head wash your hand first then paint your thumb the same color as the body press it against the paper right above the body for the head you can glue tiny googly eyes onto the head 3 x research source paint the antenna on using black paint and a thin brush you can also use a pipe cleaner instead simply bend a black pipe cleaner into a v then curl the ends glue the antenna right above the head 4 x research source let the butterfly dry before decorating it glue some gems buttons sequins or beads onto the wings if you want a simpler butterfly use your fingers and paint to make spots instead here are some more ideas decorate the butterfly with foam stickers 5 x research source draw designs with glitter glue glue black or brown pompoms along the body to make it fluffy 6 x research source draw clouds a sun and a rainbow behind the butterfly let the butterfly dry once it dries hang it up on your wall or in your window fold two sheets of colored paper in half they can be the same color or different colors these sheets will eventually make your butterfly s wings so pick a nice color trace your hand onto the paper you can keep your fingers closed or have them open cut your traced hands out keep the paper folded when you cut this way you will have a total of four hands when you are done 7 x research source glue the hands together at the palms take two hands and hold them so that the palms touch and the thumbs point upward glue them together along the palm repeat for the second set of hands you ve just finished your wings angle the hands slightly to make a v shape at the thumbs glue the wings together turn one set of wings over so that the thumbs point down overlap the two wing sets in the middle then glue them together the thumbs on the top set should point up the thumbs on the bottom set should point down cut a skinny oval out of black or brown paper for the oval glue it between the wings 8 x research source if you want a fuzzy body glue down a row of black or brown pompoms between the wings instead use a pipe cleaner to make the antenna bend a black pipe cleaner into a v shape curl the ends then glue the antenna to the top of the butterfly s body 9 x research source if you can t find any pipe cleaners cut a v out of black paper then glue it to the top of the body instead 10 x research source decorate the wings glue down gems sequins or buttons onto the wings 11 x research source you can also decorate the wings with glitter glue instead here are some more ideas glue tiny googly eyes to the head decorate the wings with foam stickers paint designs onto the butterfly using craft paint let the butterfly dry completely once it s dry you can hang it up on your wall or in your window,Pets-and-Animals

how to embroider a spider web,although their weavers can be a little scary spider webs are beautiful intricate works of art many cultures associate them with good luck in fact many victorian quilters embroidered a spider web into their quilts specifically crazy quilts because they believed that the web would bring good luck 1 x research source 2 x research source there are lots of other reasons for embroidering spider webs however be it a pattern on a halloween themed tablecloth or a detail on a witch s costume just like there are different types of spider webs there are different ways of embroidering them,draw a spider web onto your fabric using some tailor s chalk start by drawing at least 5 to 6 spokes radiating outward starting from the center connect the spokes using straight lines work in rings from center out leave some space between the rings the bigger your spider web is the more space you should leave between the rings the radiating don t all have to be the same length or the same distance apart the connecting lines don t all have to be the same distance apart having trouble drawing a spider web find a picture of a simple one online and trace it place your fabric into the embroidery hoop unscrew the outer hoop enough so that you can pull it off center your fabric over the inner hoop then place the outer hoop back on top screw the outer hoop shut slowly occasionally tugging on the edges of the fabric to keep it taut once the fabric is taut tighten the outer hoop the rest of the way you can use any type of fabric but a loosely woven fabric such as cotton or linen will work much better than a tightly woven one such as satin thread your needle the type of needle you use will depend on the type of thread you are using if you plan on using embroidery thread or embroidery floss you should use an embroidery or tapestry needle you can however use yarn for a larger project in that case use a sharp yarn needle stitch along the first radiating spoke starting from the outer edge and finishing at the center make sure that the final stitch goes downward through the fabric and out through the back you can use a chain stitch or a backstitch for this 3 x research source 4 x research source alternatively you can also do a simple straight stitch in this case start from the center of your web stitch all the way to the end of the spoke then stitch all the way back down to the center stitch along the second spoke starting from the center and finishing at the outer edge bring the needle up through the fabric fight at the start of the second spoke stitch along the second spoke using the same stitch as you did on the first one chain stitch or backstitch tie a knot on the underside of the fabric and trim the excess thread off you have just finished your first two spokes do the rest of the spokes using the same technique you will be stitching two spokes before knotting and cutting the thread if you have an odd number of spokes simply do the last spoke at the end and tie the thread off at the center of the web behind the fabric start making your first connecting line start with the upper right spoke thread your needle and push it up through the fabric on the left side of the spoke you can use the same color of thread or a contrasting one bring the thread over to the next spoke pull the thread over your first spoke

push the needle back up through the fabric just to the left of the second spoke you have wound the thread around the spoke holding it against the fabric continue making your connecting lines starting from the left side of the spoke bring the needle over to the right side of the next spoke push the needle through the fabric and pull it back up through the left side of the spoke 5 x research source when you finish the first ring tie the thread into a knot behind the fabric and snip off the excess finish your work once your spider web is done you can take the fabric out of the embroidery hoop and use it for your project alternatively you can leave the fabric in the hoop and use the hoop as a frame here is how you can turn your embroidery into a framed artwork 6 x research source take the fabric out of the hoop and paint the hoop a matching or contrasting color let the paint dry then put the fabric back into the hoop making sure that it is pulled taut trim off the excess fabric about ½ inch 1 27 centimeters away from the hoop fold the excess fabric onto the inner hoop and secure it with hot glue or fabric glue thread some ribbon through the screw on the outer hoop and tie it into a loop hang your piece on the wall lay out the base for your web on a piece of embroidery fabric using a pen or pencil make a dot for the center of your web then 9 dots around it forming a circle make sure that each of these dots is an equal distance from the center you should have something that looks like the face of a clock 7 x research source work small the dots should only be an inch 2 54 centimeters or so from the center dot this stitch is a type of embroidery stitch and is often used as a filler thread your needle thick chunky thread such as pearl cotton works great for this part but you can use any type of embroidery thread or floss you want 8 x research source create your first spoke starting from the back of your work pull the needle and thread up through your first outer dot next bring the thread down through the center dot and out through the back of the fabric 9 x research source continue making your spokes bring the needle back up to the second outer dot push the needle through the fabric and out the front of your work bring the needle back down through the center dot keep doing this until you have connected all of the outer dots to the center dot thread a

how to make a painted paper butterfly,butterflies come in all sorts of shapes sizes and colors they are pretty to look at but they can be hard to catch luckily it s possible to make your own butterfly with paint and paper with a little bit of creativity and a few extra supplies you can come up with a truly unique butterfly,crease a sheet of white paper down the middle fold your paper in half widthwise or hamburger style then unfold it the crease down the middle will be your guide 1 x research source the paper needs to have a smooth texture so something like cardstock printer paper or even a plain paper plate will all work do not use construction paper it will soak up the paint the size of the paper does not matter although larger pieces are easier to work with choose 2 to 3 colors pf paint you can use acrylic craft paint tempera paint or poster paint make sure that these colors look nice together especially when mixed for example red yellow and orange are a great combination blue pink and purple is another combination that works well don t use opposite colors such as red and green or you will get brown you can use white as 1 of your colors this will give you a pastel look use glittery or metallic paint as 1 of your colors if you want to give your butterfly extra sparkle 2 x research source drop 2 to 3 blobs of paint using your first color you can squirt the paint directly from the bottle or you can drop the paint with a spoon instead 3 x research source place some of the blobs closer to the crease and others further from the crease don t put the paint too close to the edge of the paper or it will squirt out when you squish it 4 x research source add a few more blobs using your other colors make 2 to 3 blobs using the other colors keep the blobs close together if they are too far apart they won t blend together and create a butterfly don t use too much paint or the paper will get soggy if you are starting to see more paint than white paper stop fold your paper back in half then press on it don t pick up the paper simply fold the left side over onto the right just like closing a book press on the paper with your fingers to squish the paint around you may feel the paint moving through the paper which is fine 5 x research source unfold the paper and let the paint dry each time you do this project you will get a different shape and combinations of colors sometimes the shapes look like butterflies and sometimes they look like something else 6 x research source set the paper aside so that it can dry this can take as little as 15 minutes to as long as an hour if your butterfly doesn t look like a butterfly at all you can cut the paper into a butterfly shape click here to learn how to turn painted paper into a cut out butterfly 7 x research source add a body and antennae if desired paint the body black or glue a row of black pompoms down the middle instead use a thin paintbrush and black paint to add 2 antennae above the butterfly s head you can also draw the antenna on with glitter glue instead make your butterfly fancier by decorating the wings with glitter glue and or rhinestones glue 2 googly eyes to the head if you want a silly butterfly squirt 2 to 3 colors of paint onto a sheet of white paper you can use acrylic craft paint tempera paint or poster paint cardstock or printer paper will work the best but you can use a paper plate too don t use construction paper as it will soak the paint up too much 8 x research source spread the paint around to cover the entire paper you can do this with a paintbrush or a sponge brush make sure that the different colors of paint touch but don t mix them together too much or you will get a solid color you want a sort of tie dye effect 9 x research source if you run out of paint simply squirt more on you want to cover as much of the paper as possible let the paper dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes this should not take very long at all about 15 to 20 minutes if the paper is taking too long to dry you can speed the process up with a hair dryer or by setting the paper out in the sun fold the paper in half widthwise or hamburger style bring the narrow ends of the paper together then flatten the paper it does not matter if the paint is on the outside or on the inside draw half of a butterfly on the paper with the body along the fold you can make up your own butterfly shape or you can use a stencil template you can make 1 big butterfly or you can make several smaller butterflies if you are making more than 1 butterfly make sure that they are all on the fold 10 x research source cut the paper along the line that you drew if you drew on the painted side of the paper make sure that you cut just inside the lines this way they won t show up when you finish your butterfly unfold the butterfly and decorate it if desired you can leave your butterfly the way it is or you can decorate it further with paint glue and other items if you do decide to decorate your butterfly make sure that you let it dry before moving on here are some decorating ideas glue pompoms down the middle for the body you can also use black paint instead fold a pipe cleaner into a v then glue it behind the head for the antenna glue tiny googly eyes to the head to make a face you can also paint eyes on instead paint designs onto the wings with black or white paint or glitter glue glue gemstones to the wings to make them sparkle thread string through the butterfly so that you can hang it up use a needle to thread some string through the top of the butterfly tie the ends of the string together so that you can hang it if you made many small butterflies you can thread them onto a longer piece of string and use them as a garland instead paint a slotted wooden clothespin with black or brown acrylic paint use a paintbrush with synthetic bristles to apply black or brown acrylic craft paint to the clothespin then let the paint dry this should only take about 15 to 20 minutes 11 x research source if you can t find craft paint you can use tempera paint or poster paint instead slotted clothespins look like dolls they have a round head a narrow neck and 2 thin legs they do not open and close like regular clothespins if you don t have clothespins use a craft stick instead you only need to paint 1 side 12 x research source paint a piece of white paper 2 to 3 different watercolors choose 2 to 3 different colors of watercolor and apply them to the paper in blobs with a watercolor brush let the colors flow together to create a tie dye effect choose colors that look nice when mixed together such as blue pink and purple 13 x research source don t use contrasting colors such as red and green or you may get brown where they mix construction paper will work the best but you can use printer paper too watercolor brushes are soft and made from camelhair don t use stiff brushes because they don t pick up enough paint set the paper aside so that it can dry this can take a few hours so you can do something else in the meantime if you can t wait you can dry the paper with a hairdryer or leave it out in the hot sun for a bit how long the paint takes to dry depends on what type of paper you used how wet you made it and so forth fold the paper into a fan starting from the narrow end fold the narrow edge down by 1 2 inch 1 3 cm turn the paper over and fold the edge down by another 1 2 inch 1 3 cm keep doing this until you reach the other end of the paper 14 x research source you can make the folds smaller than 1 2 inch 1 3 cm but don t make them bigger if you used a craft stick fold the paper in half and cut out a butterfly shape instead place the body of the butterfly on the fold 15 x research source slide the fan into the clothespin hold the fan by the middle and turn it so that the edges open up like a bowtie pinch the middle of the fan and slide it up into the slot on the clothespin you ll get something that looks like if you get something that looks like the fan is turned the wrong way 16 x research source secure the fan inside the clothespin with glue hot glue will work the best but you can use thick tacky glue too if you used a craft stick glue the cut out butterfly to the back of the stick the painted side of the paper needs to be facing up with the stick down the middle 17 x research source glue some googly eyes onto the head of the clothespin place 2 tiny drops of tacky glue hot glue or white school glue onto the round part of the clothespin next press 2 tiny googly eyes into the glue then let the glue dry 18 x research source make sure that you are gluing the eyes to the front of the butterfly if you don t have googly eyes you can use tiny buttons or pompoms instead make sure that they are small enough to fit on the head part of the clothespin wrap a pipecleaner around the neck to make the antenna make a v shape with a pipe cleaner wrap it around the neck of the clothespin just below the round head twist the pipe cleaner once or twice so that it holds 19 x research source black will be the most realistic but you can use any color you want if you are using a craft stick fold the pipe cleaner in half to make a v then hot glue it to the back of the stick shape the antenna into a v then curl the ends open up the pipe cleaner to make a v cut the ends down if you think they are too long use your finger a pen or a pencil to curl the ends of the pipe cleaner into spirals 20 x research source,Pets-and-Animals
how to make illuminated fireflies from plastic easter eggs,at easter time you ll probably be given a few plastic easter eggs and even if not you ll be able to grab hold of many for next to almost nothing in the sales give them a new lease of life as pretty fireflies which you can bring out to decorate the outdoor eating space all through the summer nights and easter,assemble the supplies needed these are listed below place the tea light candle or led toy inside each of the eggs you re turning into a firefly make sure it fits with ease as you need to egg to fit back together properly make the antennae cut two pipe cleaners to a suitable length and curl up one end of each push a thumbtack through the egg in two spots where each antenna will go slip the non curled ends of the firefly through these little holes bend back once inside to prevent the pipe cleaner from slipping back out draw or paint on the firefly s eyes or use googly eyes which you can buy at craft stores using a marker add a smile if wished it brightens up the firefly s expression the eyes can be made to really stand out by using white sticky labels and using these as the canvas backing simply draw an outer ring and an inner pupil for each eye and stick in place make the legs fireflies have six legs so cut size pieces of even size and bend to leg shape make sure it is a strong leg stance as it needs to hold up the bug use plenty of pipe cleaner as with the antennae stick the thumbtack in to insert in evenly spaced leg positions and bend back on the inside of the egg to prevent the legs from falling back out add wings make a little pair of wings out of the shiny paper or duct tape attach with glue or if using duct tape stick straight on however be careful not to prevent the egg from being open and closed because you need to be able to access the artificial candle only attach the wings after the join of the second piece which forms the back of the firefly create more fireflies and you re all done turn the lights out leave the tea light candle turned off when not in use to use unscrew the firefly flip the switch to on and place the firefly back together again arrange where they can be admired most such as on the dining table or buffet counter or on a shelf where people congregate they look very effective when placed against the dark background of night in an evenly spaced row,Pets-and-Animals
how to crochet butterflies,there are multiple ways to add butterflies to your crocheted works you can use a butterfly stitch to work them directly into the material or you can attach a separate butterfly applique to a separately crocheted patch of material,insert the hook into the first stitch insert the hook into the stitch indicated by the pattern at this point you should be in the middle of a crochet project and you should already have one loop on your hook the butterfly stitch is worked into two stitches and this stitch is the first of the two draw up a loop yarn over the hook once from back to front then pull the hook back through to the front of the work this should create a second loop on your hook yarn over an pull through once wrap the yarn over the hook once from back to front pull this yarn over through the top loop of your hook afterward you should have two loops on your hook when you complete this step you have completed one wing of the butterfly insert the hook into the second stitch insert the hook into the stitch immediately following the one you just worked in this is the second and final stitch you will work into while completing the butterfly stitch draw up a loop yarn over the hook once from back to front then pull the yarn and hook back through to the front of the work this should create another loop on your hook giving you a total of three loops yarn over and pull through twice wrap the yarn around the hook from back to front then pull this yarn over through the top two loops on your hook there should be two loops left on your hook yarn over and pull through twice wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front once more then pull this final yarn over through the remaining two loops on your hook you should be left with one loop on your hook the completion of this step completes a second butterfly wing chain one work one chain stitch from the loop on your hook this chain stitch completes the butterfly stitch and prepares the yarn for your next stitch work a foundation chain attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot then work a foundation of chain stitches for your project the exact chain size will vary depending on how long you want your project to be as a general rule though your chain should have an even number of stitches in it to accommodate the butterfly stitch note that you can work butterfly stitches into rows or rounds this example uses rows but the same basic principles apply to a pattern worked in the round single crochet across the chain work one single crochet into each stitch of your foundation chain this step is not strictly essential but it does give the butterfly stitch a sturdier edge to rest on if desired though you could work the butterfly stitch directly into the foundation chain or into a row made with another type of stitch half double crochet double crochet etc keep in mind that the final stitch count of this row should still be an even number chain one and turn at the start of your first row of butterfly stitches you ll need to work a turning chain of one chain stitch the turning chain increases the row height enough to accommodate the first stitch of that row without it the sides of the work would become uneven turn the work to the other side before continuing work butterfly stitches across the row starting with the first stitch after the turning chain work one butterfly stitch into every pair of stitches remember that the butterfly stitch uses two stitches from the previous row do not skip row stitches in between butterfly stitches continue working butterfly stitches into the previous row s stitches until you reach the end of the row by that point one full row of butterfly stitches will be complete chain one and turn as before work a turning chain of one chain stitch then turn the work over to the other side you will need to repeat this step in between each row from now on butterfly stitch into the wings of the previous row as before you will need to work butterfly stitches into every two stitches of the previous year repeat until you reach the end of the row the first stitch of your butterfly will go into the top loop of the first right wing of the butterfly stitch in the row beneath it the second stitch of your butterfly will go into the top loop of the second left wing of the butterfly stitch beneath it repeat as needed consecutive rows of butterfly stitches can be made simply by repeating the pattern of the second butterfly row work as many rows of butterfly stitches as desired fasten off the work when you complete the final stitch of your project you ll need to fasten off the yarn after fastening off the yarn the project is complete cut the yarn leaving a tail 4 inches 10 cm long grab this yarn tail with your crochet hook and pull it through the loop already on the hook this should form a secure knot and fasten off the yarn weave the remaining tail into the back of the stitches to hide it create a foundation ring attach the yarn to your crochet hook and work five chain stitches from the loop slip stitch the first and last chains together to form a ring note that the yarn should be tied to the hook using a standard slip knot single crochet into the ring chain one then single crochet three times into the center of the foundation ring the chain at the beginning of the round acts as a turning chain it sets the height of the round to accommodate the height of the single crochet stitch chain and slip the first wing work a series of 16 chain stitches from the loop on your hook upon reaching the end of this chain slip stitch into the last single crochet you made doing so will create one of the large upper wing halves of the butterfly single crochet into the ring work three more single crochets into the center of your foundation ring chain and slip the second wing work 11 chain stitches from the loop on your hook slip stitch the final chain of this group into the last single crochet you made this step will create the smaller lower half of the wing you started previously after completing this step one full wing is finished mirror the small wing half repeat the previous two steps to work the second small wing half of the butterfly single crochet into the foundation ring three times chain 11 times slip stitch the last chain to the last single crochet mirror the large wing half repeat the same steps used to complete the first upper wing half to work a second upper wing half single crochet into the foundation ring three times chain 16 times slip stitch the last of these chains to the last single crochet you created after completing this step both butterfly wings should be complete close the circle single crochet once into the foundation ring then join this single crochet to the very first single crochet you worked using another slip stitch at this point the shape of the butterfly is complete fasten off the yarn cut a tail roughly 2 inches 5 cm long pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the yarn weave the excess tail into the stitches to hide it after fastening off the yarn the butterfly is complete and ready to attach to another separately created crochet work position the butterfly over the work place the butterfly applique over the work you wish to attach it to consider pinning it in place to prevent it from moving around as you attach it if you want to attach the butterfly applique using surface crochet as these instructions will demonstrate you must attach it to a previously created crochet work you can attach it to other materials as well but you will need to do so by sewing it on or gluing it in place make sure that the butterfly is perfectly positioned over the work before proceeding surface slip stitch down the center work a straight line of surface slip stitches onto the material beneath the butterfly trapping the bottom and top of the butterfly s center beneath those stitches work one surface slip stitch onto the first stitch of the material this stitch should fall directly beneath the bottom center of the butterfly work your next surface slip stitch over the bottom center stitch of your butterfly this stitch should be worked onto the next stitch of your crocheted material just to the inside of the butterfly s center continue working surface slip stitches onto the bottom material and up the center of the butterfly make as many stitches as necessary to reach the top of the butterfly your final surface slip stitch should be worked onto the stitch of the material just outside of the butterfly s center it should also be worked over the top center stitch of the butterfly applique bind off the yarn once you ve attached the butterfly cut the yarn leaving tail roughly 3 inches 7 6 cm long pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the butterfly and secure its place on the material beneath if you do not want to add antennae make sure that the tail lies to the wrong side of the material weave the excess into your stitches to hide it then stop at this step if you do want add antennae leave the tail on the outside of the work and continue onto the next step split the strands into antennae use your thumbnail to carefully split the tail of your crochet yarn into two even halves unwind these halves down to the knot then straighten them out so they point in opposite directions forming antennae for the butterfly if you cannot use your thumbnail to split the yarn consider using an embroidery needle the blunt edge of your scissors blade a straight pin or a similarly thin tool consider knotting the ends of the divided antennae to prevent further fraying from occurring alternatively apply a small dot of seam sealant liquid to the ends of both antennae to accomplish the same purpose after completing this step the butterfly is complete,Pets-and-Animals

how to make a fuzzy ball pipe cleaner butterfly,this is a fun family craft using fuzzy wire it s very easy to do and turns out to be really nice kids will love making these butterflies and hanging them in their room or playing with them,make the body piece first lay down two full length fuzzy wires side by side both in the same color twist the two fuzzy wires together from one end leave about one inch 2 5cm at the top for the antenna untwisted bend the untwisted ends into a v shape this will form the antenna the body piece is now ready for adding the wings to make the upper wings first use one fuzzy wire for the first wing here you might wish to change to a different color from the body piece shape the fuzzy wire into a half circle shape attach it to the body piece by winding the ends around the body piece attach about one inch 2 5cm from the top of the body piece and the other end in the middle of the body piece this forms the top of the first wing to attach wind the ends around firmly about twice or three times use as little wire as possible for winding on to allow most of the wire to serve as the wing repeat the same wing creation but on the exact opposite side wrap just underneath each of the attachment areas of the already added wing using another piece of fuzzy wire in the same color after adding this you should have two top wing pieces firmly in place when done the whole piece should look like an oval make the bottom wings take another piece of fuzzy wire either in the same color as the top wings or in a different but matching color make a half circle this time tie one end in the middle and the other end to near the base of the body piece repeat the same step just done for the other side of the bottom wing attach just under the attachment parts for the first bottom wing when done the whole thing should look like a figure eight glue fuzzy balls all down the twisted body of the butterfly make the head from fuzzy balls glue two balls together ideally these would be in the same color to give a uniform impression of the head shape glue the head piece on about an inch 2 5cm from the top of the body piece or add it just under the antenna add googly eyes if you d like or just leave it as it is finished now it s time to enjoy your new butterfly creation,Pets-and-Animals
how to make an origami fish,fish are colorful fascinating creatures and you can make your own origami version right at home all you need is a square piece of paper origami paper will be the easiest to work with but you can try other types of paper too start by making the base for your fish then fold the tail and fins and voila you can add your fish to your origami animal kingdom along with an origami bird wolf and whale,fold a square piece of paper in half both ways unfolding it after each fold first fold the paper in half one way and unfold it then fold it in half the other way and unfold it again make both of these folds mountain folds a mountain fold is where the crease makes a peak on the top side of the paper 1 x research source when you re finished there should be 2 creases that intersect in the center of the paper origami paper will work the best for this but you can use printer paper or any other kind of paper you have lying around too origami squares are usually 6 by 6 inches 15 cm 15 cm you can experiment with using bigger or larger squares but they might be more difficult to fold crease the paper in half diagonally both ways unfolding it after each fold start by folding the paper in half diagonally one way then unfold it and fold it in half diagonally the other way unfold the paper again make both of these folds valley folds a valley fold is the opposite of a mountain fold the crease of a valley fold should look like a valley instead of a peak 2 x research source at this point there should be 4 creases that intersect at the center of the paper bring the 4 corners of the paper together then flatten the model press the 4 corners toward one another to start collapsing the model once they re touching flatten the model so you re left with a small square 3 x research source the square you re left with will be smaller than the square you started with rotate the model so it looks like a diamond the open corner of the model should be pointing toward you the opposite corner which is closed should be pointing away from you 4 x research source crease the left and right corners of the top flap in toward the center first take the left corner of the top flap and fold it in toward the center line crease the fold then do the same thing with the right corner of the top flap 5 x research source go over the creases a few times with your finger since the rest of the process will be easier if they re crisp fold down the top corner the fold should line up with the top edges of the previous fold after you fold down the top corner crease the fold 6 x research source unfold all 3 corners that you just folded first unfold the top corner then unfold the left and right corners 7 x research source when you re finished there should be a triangle shaped crease on the top of the model lift up the bottom corner of the top flap grab the corner in between your fingers and lift it up toward the top corner of the model to lift up the top flap hold the bottom corner of the bottom flap down on the table with one of your fingers so it doesn t move 8 x research source fold along the creases to flatten the model first fold the 2 edges at the bottom of the model down toward the center along the creases then do the same thing with the 2 edges at the top of the model these are the edges on the flap you re holding up with your fingers 9 x research source when you re finished the model should be completely flat turn the model over and repeat on the other side first fold the left and right corners in toward the center followed by the top corner then unfold all 3 corners lift the bottom corner up toward the top like you did with the bottom corner on the other side of the model finish by folding all of the edges along the creases to flatten the model 10 x research source at this stage the model should be diamond shaped and completely flat fold the top point on each side down along the crease first fold the top point on the side you re working on down along the crease then turn the model over and do the same thing with the top point on the other side 11 x research source when you re finished the model should resemble a kite crease one of the lower points up to the top point the lower point is the point that you folded down in the previous step the top point is the point that s now at the top of the model fold the lower point up to the top point so both points meet then crease along the fold 12 x research source don t unfold after you make the crease fold the same point down and over to the left corner the point and left corner should meet crease along the fold 13 x research source run your finger over the crease a few times since the next step will be easier if the crease is crisp crease the same point over to the right corner then fold the flap down when the point meets the right corner crease along the fold then fold the flap you ve been working on down along the crease 14 x research source the flap should easily fold down along an existing crease don t make a new crease to fold it down turn the model over and repeat the process on the other side first fold the bottom point up to the top point and crease then fold the same point over to the left corner before folding it over to the right corner finally fold the flap down along the crease 15 x research source at this point you re done folding the tail fold the left and right corners in toward the center line on each side of the model first fold the left and right corners on the top side of the model in toward the center line then turn the model over and repeat with the corners on that side 16 x research source when you re finished the model should look like a diamond with the 2 tail pieces sticking out the sides grab the bottom points with your fingers there should be 2 points at the bottom of the model grab one point with each hand 17 x research source pull the points away from each other to create the fins as you pull on the points the model will unfold slightly and become 3 dimensional stop pulling when the fins make a 45 degree angle with the center line of the model 18 x research source once you ve made the fins you re all

starting paper size to use is 15 in 15 in 38 cm 38 cm if your piece of paper has a white side and a colored side place the colored side face down on the table that side will form the outer part of the whale 1 x research source bigger pieces of paper are easier to work with if you re a beginner practice folding techniques with a bigger piece of paper fold the paper in half open it and fold it in half the other way rotate the paper until it looks like a diamond with 1 corner pointing towards you bring the bottom point to the top point and flatten the page afterward open the paper and repeat the fold with the opposite corners 2 x research source the paper will have a horizontal and vertical crease running through its center these creases are guidelines you can use to help you fold the paper into the shape of a whale fold the top edges to the center crease start with the right side bring the right edge over until it aligns with the vertical center crease carefully flatten the paper to create another crease repeat this with the top left edge without opening the paper back up 3 x research source make sure the paper is oriented in a diamond shape before you fold it to make a good crease hold the paper still with a free finger pin the flap of paper in place as you smooth it out flip the paper over and bring the tail to the top point your paper will look like a kite at this point position it so the thin tail points toward you then bring the tail up until it is over the uppermost corner and crease the fold 4 x research source if your paper has a white backside you will be making this fold on the colored side turn the paper over and open the pockets with your finger the folded kite will have 2 little pockets along its bottom edge grasp the flaps by their free edges in the center of the paper use your finger to move the pockets away from the table push against their free edges to make them stand up 5 x research source for the best result work with 1 pocket at a time bring the pocket s tip over to the center and flatten it when you lift the pocket flaps away from the page the paper s left and right corners will also lift up push against the outside edge of each pocket to bring the corner over to the center of the paper then smooth them out to form a crease 6 x research source when this fold is done correctly the pockets will form big triangles the paper will look like an uneven diamond 7 x research source fold the paper s top layer straight down slide your fingers around the edges of the paper separate the top layer from the paper underneath it then bring the point down the paper will have a crease about ¼ of the way up from the bottom level with the diamond s left and right corners fold the paper down along this line 8 x research source make sure you only fold the top layer or else the paper won t be in the correct shape for the next step after you make the fold the paper will be in the shape of a perfect diamond flip the paper over and push the fin flaps to the left after you turn the paper over orient it so the diamond s longer corners point to the right and left the flaps are in the middle push them over and flatten them against the paper 9 x research source turn the paper over and fold the left point to the center flip the paper vertically keeping the fin flaps pointed towards the left then grab the left corner and align it with the paper s center point crease the fold to finish it 10 x research source be careful about how you flip the paper flipping it the wrong way can affect how your whale turns out fold the bottom edge about ⅓ of the way up the paper hold the paper still with the sides of your hands carefully bring the bottom edge up slightly pushing it onto the whale s body and flattening it this fold determines how wide the whale s body will be 11 x research source making the fold too big can make the whale s body look too small you only need to fold the edge up a little enough to make it horizontally flat bring the top half of the whale down over the bottom half fold the entire whale in half along the horizontal crease running through the center once you do this you will be able to see the shape of the whale s body 12 x research source the top half of the paper will overhang the bottom half slightly this is okay and will be fixed in the next step turn the overhanging top edge down and tuck it into the whale flip the whale over so pointed edge is on top and the flat edge is on the bottom grasp the pointed edge and fold it down against the whale s body then unfold it and open the whale s top edge put the fold inside the whale to finish its basic shape 13 x research source take a look at your work make sure both sides of the whale look even the top and bottom edges will both be level move the whale onto its back and pull the fin flaps out the whale s back is the shorter side you will see 2 flaps of paper near the whale s head move each flap back away from the head at a diagonal angle taking care not to pull them too far pull them about ⅔ of the way towards the whale s body and down 14 x research source if you move the flippers too close to the body they won t stand out also pull them down a little so the tips reach above the body fold the flippers carefully since the thin origami paper can tear fold the whale s tail straight up grasp the tip and move the tail up away from the whale s body when you do this correctly the tail s inner edge will form a perfect diagonal press down hard on it to make a good crease 15 x research source adjust the fold to change the tail s size folding more of the tail makes it bigger change it according to how you want your whale to look open the whale and cut a slit in the tail unfold the tail then spread apart the whale along its top edge look for the crease in the tail you made with your last fold use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the center of the tail to that crease 16 x research source if you don t like doing scissors you can skip this part instead leave your whale s tail folded fold the whale s tail flaps up against one another close the whale back up then separate the tail flaps grasp the flap closest to you folding it so it points up towards the ceiling fold the other flap in the opposite direction until it is behind the first flap perfectly aligned with it 17 x research source push the flaps hard together so they stay in place or else the tail may unfurl open the tail flaps up and crease them in place you can adjust the tail flaps to whatever angle you like separate them bringing each flap down so it points out towards the side when you get them where you want them press them between your fingers to crease them and hold them in place 18 x research source your whale is done you can try decorating yours drawing on an eye or mouth if you d like or you can start over and make another one,Pets-and-Animals

how to make an origami fish,fish are colorful fascinating creatures and you can make your own origami version right at home all you need is a square piece of paper origami paper will be the easiest to work with but you can try other types of paper too start by making the base for your fish then fold the tail and fins and voila you can add your fish to your origami animal kingdom along with an origami bird wolf and whale,fold a square piece of paper in half both ways unfolding it after each fold first fold the paper in half one way and unfold it then fold it in half the other way and unfold it again make both of these folds mountain folds a mountain fold is where the crease makes a peak on the top side of the paper 1 x research source when you re finished there should be 2 creases that intersect in the center of the paper origami paper will work the best for this but you can use printer paper or any other kind of paper you have lying around too origami squares are usually 6 by 6 inches 15 cm 15 cm you can experiment with using bigger or larger squares but they might be more difficult to fold crease the paper in half diagonally both ways unfolding it after each fold start by folding the paper in half diagonally one way then unfold it and fold it in half diagonally the other way unfold the paper again make both of these folds valley folds a valley fold is the opposite of a mountain fold the crease of a valley fold should look like a valley instead of a peak 2 x research source at this point there should be 4 creases that intersect at the center of the paper bring the 4 corners of the paper together then flatten the model press the 4 corners toward one another to start collapsing the model once they re touching flatten the model so you re left with a small square 3 x research source the square you re left with will be smaller than the square you started with rotate the model so it looks like a diamond the open corner of the model should be pointing toward you the opposite corner which is closed should be pointing away from you 4 x research source crease the left and right corners of the top flap in toward the center first take the left corner of the top flap and fold it in toward the center line crease the fold then do the same thing with the right corner of the top flap 5 x research source go over the creases a few times with your finger since the rest of the process will be easier if they re crisp fold down the top corner the fold should line up with the top edges of the previous fold after you fold down the top corner crease the fold 6 x research source unfold all 3 corners that you just folded first unfold the top corner then unfold the left and right corners 7 x research source when you re finished there should be a triangle shaped crease on the top of the model lift up the bottom corner of the top flap grab the corner in between your fingers and lift it up toward the top corner of the model to lift up the top flap hold the bottom corner of the bottom flap down on the table with one of your fingers so it doesn t move 8 x research source fold along the creases to flatten the model first fold the 2 edges at the bottom of the model down toward the center along the creases then do the same thing with the 2 edges at the top of the model these are the edges on the flap you re holding up with your fingers 9 x research source when you re finished the model should be completely flat turn the model over and repeat on the other side first fold the left and right corners in toward the center followed by the top corner then unfold all 3 corners lift the bottom corner up toward the top like you did with the bottom corner on the other side of the model finish by folding all of the edges along the creases to flatten the model 10 x research source at this stage the model should be diamond shaped and completely flat fold the top point on each side down along the crease first fold the top point on the side you re working on down along the crease then turn the model over and do the same thing with the top point on the other side 11 x research source when you re finished the model should resemble a kite crease one of the lower points up to the top point the lower point is the point that you folded down in the previous step the top point is the point that s now at the top of the model fold the lower point up to the top point so both points meet then crease along the fold 12 x research source don t unfold after you make the crease fold the same point down and over to the left corner the point and left corner should meet crease along the fold 13 x research source run your finger over the crease a few times since the next step will be easier if the crease is crisp crease the same point over to the right corner then fold the flap down when the point meets the right corner crease along the fold then fold the flap you ve been working on down along the crease 14 x research source the flap should easily fold down along an existing crease don t make a new crease to fold it down turn the model over and repeat the process on the other side first fold the bottom point up to the top point and crease then fold the same point over to the left corner before folding it over to the right corner finally fold the flap down along the crease 15 x research source at this point you re done folding the tail fold the left and right corners in toward the center line on each side of the model first fold the left and right corners on the top side of the model in toward the center line then turn the model over and repeat with the corners on that side 16 x research source when you re finished the model should look like a diamond with the 2 tail pieces sticking out the sides grab the bottom points with your fingers there should be 2 points at the bottom of the model grab one point with each hand 17 x research source pull the points away from each other to create the fins as you pull on the points the model will unfold slightly and become 3 dimensional stop pulling when the fins make a 45 degree angle with the center line of the model 18 x research source once you ve made the fins you re all finished,Pets-and-Animals
how to make an origami whale,an origami whale is a fun project for anyone who loves marine life making a whale is relatively simple for anyone who knows some basic origami folds you will need a piece of origami paper and a pair of scissors carefully fold the paper to create the whale s body and small details like the flippers and tail,lay a square piece of origami paper on a flat surface a good starting paper size to use is 15 in 15 in 38 cm 38 cm if your piece of paper has a white side and a colored side place the colored side face down on the table that side will form the outer part of the whale 1 x research source bigger pieces of paper are easier to work with if you re a beginner practice folding techniques with a bigger piece of paper fold the paper in half open it and fold it in half the other way rotate the paper until it looks like a diamond with 1 corner pointing towards you bring the bottom point to the top point and flatten the page afterward open the paper and repeat the fold with the opposite corners 2 x research source the paper will have a horizontal and vertical crease running through its center these creases are guidelines you can use to help you fold the paper into the shape of a whale fold the top edges to the center crease start with the right side bring the right edge over until it aligns with the vertical center crease carefully flatten the paper to create another crease repeat this with the top left edge without opening the paper back up 3 x research source make sure the paper is oriented in a diamond shape before you fold it to make a good crease hold the paper still with a free finger pin the flap of paper in place as you smooth it out flip the paper over and bring the tail to the top point your paper will look like a kite at this point position it so the thin tail points toward you then bring the tail up until it is over the uppermost corner and crease the fold 4 x research source if your paper has a white backside you will be making this fold on the colored side turn the paper over and open the pockets with your finger the folded kite will have 2 little pockets along its bottom edge grasp the flaps by their free edges in the center of the paper use your finger to move the pockets away from the table push against their free edges to make them stand up 5 x research source for the best result work with 1 pocket at a time bring the pocket s tip over to the center and flatten it when you lift the pocket flaps away from the page the paper s left and right corners will also lift up push against the outside edge of each pocket to bring the corner over to the center of the paper then smooth them out to form a crease 6 x research source when this fold is done correctly the pockets will form big triangles the paper will look like an uneven diamond 7 x research source fold the paper s top layer straight down slide your fingers around the edges of the paper separate the top layer from the paper underneath it then bring the point down the paper will have a crease about ¼ of the way up from the bottom level with the diamond s left and right corners fold the paper down along this line 8 x research source make sure you only fold the top layer or else the paper won t be in the correct shape for the next step after you make the fold the paper will be in the shape of a perfect diamond flip the paper over and push the fin flaps to the left after you turn the paper over orient it so the diamond s longer corners point to the right and left the flaps are in the middle push them over and flatten them against the paper 9 x research source turn the paper over and fold the left point to the center flip the paper vertically keeping the fin flaps pointed towards the left then grab the left corner and align it with the paper s center point crease the fold to finish it 10 x research source be careful about how you flip the paper flipping it the wrong way can affect how your whale turns out fold the bottom edge about ⅓ of the way up the paper hold the paper still with the sides of your hands carefully bring the bottom edge up slightly pushing it onto the whale s body and flattening it this fold determines how wide the whale s body will be 11 x research source making the fold too big can make the whale s body look too small you only need to fold the edge up a little enough to make it horizontally flat bring the top half of the whale down over the bottom half fold the entire whale in half along the horizontal crease running through the center once you do this you will be able to see the shape of the whale s body 12 x research source the top half of the paper will overhang the bottom half slightly this is okay and will be fixed in the next step turn the overhanging top edge down and tuck it into the whale flip the whale over so pointed edge is on top and the flat edge is on the bottom grasp the pointed edge and fold it down against the whale s body then unfold it and open the whale s top edge put the fold inside the whale to finish its basic shape 13 x research source take a look at your work make sure both sides of the whale look even the top and bottom edges will both be level move the whale onto its back and pull the fin flaps out the whale s back is the shorter side you will see 2 flaps of paper near the whale s head move each flap back away from the head at a diagonal angle taking care not to pull them too far pull them about ⅔ of the way towards the whale s body and down 14 x research source if you move the flippers too close to the body they won t stand out also pull them down a little so the tips reach above the body fold the flippers carefully since the thin origami paper can tear fold the whale s tail straight up grasp the tip and move the tail up away from the whale s body when you do this correctly the tail s inner edge will form a perfect diagonal press down hard on it to make a good crease 15 x research source adjust the fold to change the tail s size folding more of the tail makes it bigger change it according to how you want your whale to look open the whale and cut a slit in the tail unfold the tail then spread apart the whale along its top edge look for the crease in the tail you made with your last fold use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the center of the tail to that crease 16 x research source if you don t like doing scissors you can skip this part instead leave your whale s tail folded fold the whale s tail flaps up against one another close the whale back up then separate the tail flaps grasp the flap closest to you folding it so it points up towards the ceiling fold the other flap in the opposite direction until it is behind the first flap perfectly aligned with it 17 x research source push the flaps hard together so they stay in place or else the tail may unfurl open the tail flaps up and crease them in place you can adjust the tail flaps to whatever angle you like separate them bringing each flap down so it points out towards the side when you get them where you want them press them between your fingers to crease them and hold them in place 18 x research source your whale is done you can try decorating yours drawing on an eye or mouth if you d like or you can start over and make another one,Pets-and-Animals
how to make a turtle out of a dollar bill,origami is the art of folding paper into animals and is a chinese tradition that has existed since 105 a d 1 x research source while you typically use origami paper to fold these elaborate objects you can also create origami by using the bills you have in your wallet making a turtle out of a dollar bill is an easy gift you can make for a friend or significant other takes less than 15 minutes to do and doesn t destroy the value of the bill that you use 2 x research source,obtain a crisp crease free bill the more crisp the bill the easier it will be to make clean folds make sure there aren t any existing creases because you ll be creating new creases that will guide you throughout the folding of the turtle if you can t find a crisp 1 bill try looking for a 10 or 20 bill work on a flat surface like a desk or workbench so you can press hard on the folds fold the dollar bill in half lengthwise fold the dollar bill in half lining the top of the bill with the very bottom of the bill the top and bottom edges should not overlap or be folded on an angle if you unfolded the bill there would be a line running horizontally through the middle of the bill fold the bill in half from right to left fold it in half so the left edge lines up with the right edge of the bill press down with your fingernail to flatten out the bill the bill should now be exactly a quarter of the size that it was when you started unfold the bill and flatten it this should reveal two creases forming a perpendicular cross in the middle of the bill this also splits your bill into 4 equally sized quadrants the cross should meet right in the middle of george washington s cheek fold the bottom right hand corner on a 90 degree angle the right hand side of the bill should align with the center crease this also should leave george washington s face half covered by the right side of your bill fold the bottom left hand corner to the center crease this should form a point where you folded both sides and resemble an upside down pyramid make sure the flat end of the pyramid lines up so you re getting a perfectly diagonal crease unfold then fold the top right and left corner of the bill to the center crease unfold the bill so it s flat and repeat the steps this time using the top corners of the bill take the top left hand corner of the bill and bring it down creating a 90 degree angle repeat with the right hand corner fold the two xs in half vertically at this point you should have two x shapes formed by the creases you just made fold the x on both sides so that each one has a crease running down the middle take the left edge of your bill and fold it horizontally so it lines up with the center crease to get a perfect vertical crease down the center of your x this is the last crease that you need to make before you start folding your bill into a turtle unfold your bill you should now see a cross in the middle of the bill two creases on each side that form an x and a vertical crease in each x the middle of your bill should look like a diamond where the left and right x meet creating creases may seem unnecessary but it makes it easier to fold your turtle collapse the top and bottom of the x on the left hand when you pinch the top and bottom of the x it should form a triangular flap on the left hand side 3 x research source if you folded your creases accurately it should be a perfect triangle and the bottom of the triangle should run in a straight line if it doesn t look like a triangle unfold it and try it again your edges should all line up except for the edge near the center crease of the bill which should overlap the center crease by around a centimeter fold back the excess bill in the center of the turtle fold the excess flap that hangs over the center crease of your turtle towards the left point of its shell this will create a long rectangular fold on the left hand side of the middle crease repeat the same process on other side pinch the right hand x and repeat the steps so you have a triangle of exactly the same size on the right side of your bill fold back the excess flap on the right hand side your bill should now look like a diamond if you folded your bill face up you should see the pyramids in your right triangle and the bald eagle in your left triangle fold the tip of the triangle on the left and right sides towards the center this will form the shell of the turtle if you flip your bill over it should look like a hexagon you ve just completed your turtle s shell on the top of the turtle s shell you should see in god we trust fold the inside center flaps on an angle towards the outside of the bill this will form the turtle s feet you will have four total center flaps to fold on a 60 90 degree angle you can change the angle in which these flaps are folded just keep in mind they will change the appearance of your turtle s feet flip the bill over to make sure it can stand you should now have a hexagon shell and four feet from the folds you just made if you ve done everything right your turtle should be able to stand on the feet you folded fold the tip of hexagon down towards the inside of the turtle and flip over this will form the turtle s head when you flip your turtle over and it will look like an upside down triangle at the top of your hexagon the more you fold the top in the larger you can make your turtle s head fold the triangle back up a half centimeter below the previous fold this will give the appearance of your turtle head coming out its shell you can repeat the process with the bottom of your turtle to create a tail but loosen the fold and make it smaller so it doesn t look like your turtle has two heads,Pets-and-Animals
how to make an origami stingray,despite famous australian icon steve irwin being killed stingrays are tame animals they love to lie about in the sand this article will guide you to make an origami stingray,fold the paper in half on the diagonal axis crease well and unfold fold top and bottom corners to meet into the center bring the left tip to the right crease well and unfold tuck underneath the top layer of paper fold the top and bottom corners so they meet in the center crease them well make a reverse fold using the crease you made fold the right side over the left side fold the right side back nearly all the way to create the tail fold the top and bottom half to the centre to keep the tail flat you will need to make a squash fold fold the two flaps at the front of the stingray diagonally take care to ensure you only fold the top layer fold the entire stingray in half lengthways fold the tail down diagonally on both sides crease the line well unfold the stingray and decorate you can draw eyes gills or a pattern,Pets-and-Animals
how to make goldfish paper lanterns,goldfish are a classic fish and very popular when it comes to decorating a party or room with an underwater theme instead of using paper cutouts of goldfish why not make 3d goldfish out of paper lanterns they are lightweight colorful and very easy to make you can make a simple goldfish by adding some eyes and fins out of construction paper or you can get fancier with tissue paper instead,get a solid colored paper lantern and open it up most goldfish are orange but yours can be any color you want draw a tail fin shape onto a sheet of construction paper then cut it out with a pair of scissors make the base of the tail straight so that you can attach it to the lantern be sure to draw the tail ½ to 1 inch 1 27 to 2 54 centimeters longer than you want it to be choose a color that closely matches the color of your lantern make the base of the tail fold the base of the tail down by ½ to 1 inch 1 25 to 2 54 centimeters to make a flap cut a slit into the middle of the flap all the way down to the folded edge to create two flaps leave one of the flaps the way it is and fold the other one to the back of the fin you will now have two flaps with each one pointing in a different direction this will not only allow the tail to flap about but also make it easier to glue on 1 x research source attach the fin to the lantern turn the lantern so that one of the holes is facing up use a hot glue gun or double sided tape to attach the tail to the side of the lantern draw two side fin shapes then cut them out to make the fins even stack two sheets of construction paper one on top of the other first draw your fin shape then cut it out you don t need to make the base of the fins flat or straight attach the fins to the side of the lantern find the middle of the lantern then attach the bottom tip of the fin with a drop of glue or a small piece of double sided tape repeat this step for the other side of the fish with the other fin don t glue the entire fin down you want it to stick out cut two circles out of white construction paper and two circles out of black construction paper to make the eyes make sure that the black circles are smaller you can also use printer paper and cardstock for this another alternative would be to use large googly eyes make sure that they are proportionate to your fish 2 x research source attach the eyes to the fish position them in front of the side fins and just above them you can attach them using double sided tape or a hot glue gun if you are using googly eyes however a hot glue might be the better option thread some string through the top of the fish so that you can hang it thread a piece of string through the bar in the top hole of your lantern then tie it into a loop if your lantern doesn t have a bar poke two small holes in the top of the lantern just below the ring opening hang the loop from a hook wherever you want these lanterns make great decorations for underwater themed parties and rooms be careful not to get them wet however get a solid colored paper lantern and open it up the smaller your lantern is the easier it will be to work with look for something that is about 12 inches 30 48 centimeters in diameter most goldfish are orange but you can make your goldfish any color you want trace a circle that is the same size as the smaller opening on your lantern onto a sheet of tissue paper choose a different color than your lantern it can be lighter darker or even a contrasting color make the circle as even as you can if possible use a pencil to trace around to smaller opening of the lantern if both of the openings are the same size simply choose one of them trace a larger circle around the first circle how much space you leave between the two circles depends on the size of you lantern the bigger your lantern is the more space you will need start with ½ inch 1 27 centimeters and go from there cut the circles out then save the ring discard the inner circle or save it for another project use a glue stick to glue the ring onto the smaller opening this will create an open mouth for the goldfish if you have any excess tissue paper hanging over the opening you can trim it off with a pair of scissors or fold it into the lantern and secure it with more glue 3 x research source cut two circles out of white tissue paper and two smaller circles out of black cardstock or construction paper if you don t have any white tissue paper you can use white printer paper instead glue the black circles onto the white circles then the white circles onto the lantern glue the white circles above the mouth and slightly to the side cut out two top fin shapes out of tissue paper stack two sheets of tissue paper then cut a fin shape out this way you will end up with two matching fins use a color that matches your lantern most top fins will be long and somewhat skinny make sure that yours is at least 2 inches 5 08 centimeters tall glue them together except for the bottom ½ to 1 inch 1 27 to 2 54 centimeters use a pair of scissors to trim of any overhanging tissue paper the double tissue paper layer will help the top fin stand up 4 x research source fold the loose ends of the fin down to create two flaps then attach it to the fish place a strip of double sided tape to each flap then place the fin on top of the fish run your finger across the top of each flap to seal the tape cut out two side fins out of matching tissue paper then attach them to the sides of the fish you can use a glue stick or double sides tape for this make sure that you are only gluing the bottom edge so that the fins can flap around you don t have to create double layers for these or fold any flaps the side fins can be as long and flowing as you d like cut out two tail shapes out of matching tissue paper stack two sheets of tissue paper then cut a tail fin out you will end up with two identical shapes you will be fitting the tail over the back hole on your lantern so be sure to add ½ of the hole s width plus an additional ½ to 1 inch 1 27 to 2 54 centimeters glue them together except for the bottom few inches how much you leave unglued depends on the excess amount you added once again use a pair of scissors to trim off any overhanging pieces of tissue paper 5 x research source fold the loose ends out to create flaps then attach them to the back of the fish position the tail over the back opening fold the excess tissue paper over the edges of the opening then glue or tape them down onto the body of the fish 6 x research source use a needle to thread clear string through the top of the fish be sure to go under one of the metal ribs to prevent the tissue paper from tearing tie the string into a loop then hang your fish this fish makes a great decoration for parties or underwater themed rooms be careful not to get it wet however,Pets-and-Animals

how to paint eyes,if eyes are a gateway to the soul should they be easy to create painting eyes takes time and preparation like most subjects to be painted you can create as realistic of an eye if you have the time for it in modern art most eyes represented are not realistic create the eyes you want to see and use your own artistic style,understand drawing drawing is a great practice for any aspiring painter drawing helps flush out the design properties before taking the design to paint while drawing and painting are different mediums the fundamentals are the same 1 x research source observe eyes if you want plenty of images and ideas search google images for eyes and you ll find more than you can swallow immerse yourself for inspiration if you have a mirror nearby your canvas then you have the best source for eyes your own doodle eyes before going into the long lengths of planning and executing a painting of eyes try messing around first a great way to find your style is by doodling create a bunch of eyes in a quick manner the point is to not think about what your drawing that will come later 2 x research source look over your doodles look through the progression of eyes you drew and see how they matured select the eye you are most proud of don t necessarily select the eye that most resembles an eye instead select an eye that looks best to you redraw the eye take out a pen or pencil and try your hand at recreating the eye you re most proud of spend a little more time reformulating this eye as to when you were quickly doodling try to fill up a page in your sketchbook look over your work and select the eye you are most proud of 3 x research source draw with detail now spend more time recreating the latest eye this time around spend more attention to the details of the eye incorporate more details into your doodle this is when you could start looking at real life eyes for inspiration incorporate as much detail into the framework you ve created 4 x research source create a simplified drawing now draw an eye that is a simplified version of the detailed eye you just drew draw this onto canvas or whatever you choose to paint onto this will act as the outline for the eyes you re about to paint create a flesh color you will use this as the base to paint the eye there are different color combinations you can use depending on what skin tone you are going for try to recreate your own skin tone for if you re unsure what skin tone to use paint ovals as eyes use the outline you drew earlier if you want a guide paint two ovals close to each other this will act as the foundation for the rest of the painting create the sclera the sclera is the white part of your eyes 5 x research source the sclera in the eyes is never a pure white mix white paint with a touch of another color like light grey light blue or light pink paint two ovals in the paint you just created the scleras should be the same shape as the outline of the eyes but smaller and inside the flesh toned outline paint the eyelids add depth by shading and adding different tints to make simple eyelashes you can draw with dark brown around the oval but make sure to blend it well with the skin color if you want to make more realistic eyelashes you need a small brush and add the lashes one by one create the iris paint the iris to your desired eye color in this example blue is being used add darker shades or other tints of the color to make a vivid eye start by simply creating a circle of the color you selected paint a very thin line all the way around the iris on the inside and then use a dry brush to do spokes inwards towards the center think of a cd the way the colors are angled to head inwards towards the hole in the center add shading shade the eyes in keeping in mind where the light source is coming from and shade accordingly 6 x research source don t worry if the iris goes over the edges of your white paint as you will add eyelids after the eyes are done so the eyes look well set in the face create the pupils make the pupils solid black look at pictures for more references they should be in the center of the iris created earlier add eye sparkles this is white part of the pupil where the light reflects off the surface of the eye 7 x research source add more details within the eye add in the corner of the eye a pink tone in the fleshy parts of the eye and add some white while you are doing that add some nerves that run across the ovals of your eye make sure you use little paint and blend it well with the rest of the oval,Pets-and-Animals
how to paint a portrait of a dog,painting a dog portrait can be a challenging endeavor for a beginner but very rewarding when you can capture your dog s individual personality this tutorial will guide you through the process of painting any breed of dog,practice drawing straight lines take a piece of paper and draw randomly spaced dots around the edges practice drawing straight lines between all the dots this will come in handy when you are finding the proportions and placing the features of the dog s head practice color mixing use a simple computer painting program to print out a sheet of small randomly colored squares mix small portions of these colors as accurately as you can with your chosen opaque paint even if you work digitally buy some cheap paints and practice mixing being able to identify the mixing components of a color is extremely helpful for matching the colors of your subject if you are doing opaque painting you need to try coloring on the actual material that you want to paint on this will allow you to foresee how the material absorbs and paints diffuse which can help you to create different effects choose a reference image creating a painting that looks three dimensional is easier if you can accurately judge the forms of your subject good lighting is a key factor to doing this well choose a reference image that features a single strong direct light source that creates a clear separation of light and shadow you can identify a direct light source by looking for hard edged cast shadows a simple uniform background makes it easier to see the outline of the subject map out the proportions of your subject ensure that the proportions of your painted subject are correct by mapping out key features in the reference for comparison look for major lines of action red lines such as the center line of the head or the tilt of the eyes when sketching in other features compare their placement and orientation to these lines note the angles blue lines that parts of the head make with each other these angles remain the same regardless of the size of your painting pick out spots that are easy to keep track of such as the points of the ears the nostrils and hard corners where the jaw and collar overlap with the neck negative space yellow area is the shape created by the area around the subject in many cases negative space is far simpler and easier to judge than the shapes inside the subject sketch the under structure begin by drawing the major lines of action draw straight lines between the key features making sure the angles are accurate using simple lines makes it easy to adjust proportions before drawing in more complicated forms resist drawing small details and focus instead on correctly placing the biggest forms the sketch should show accurate proportions keep adjusting your guidelines until all the forms are the correct size identify basic light medium and dark value areas in the reference understanding how light is hitting your subject is the most important factor in making your painting look three dimensional light value areas are most directly facing the light source there are two types of medium value areas planes of the form that are turning away from the light and about to go into shadow light is bouncing off of objects behind the subject and hitting them from the opposite side but much less strongly than the direct light this is called reflected light dark value areas are where the least amount of light is shining on the subject because the planes of the form are tangent to the light sources so they aren t getting light from either the front or back they occur between medium value areas and are called core shadows paint in the basic values on your under structure sketch mix 4 neutral gray values light medium dark and a background value don t try to perfectly match any values because this under painting will be completely covered by the final colors the different value areas are only an organizational tool apply the values using the sketch as a guide working with only four values makes this step simple and fast use a large brush if you have trouble placing the medium values try painting only light and dark first before adding medium step back 10 feet 3 meters from the painting to get an overall impression the painting should begin look like a three dimensional form with light shining on it start applying color using your under painting as a guide this is where the painting begins to really look like the dog reference using the reference for comparison mix colors for each value section defined by your under painting and lay in the colors within the pre mapped areas with a large brush after the biggest areas are painted layer on additional colors but keep using the large brush identify large plane boundaries in the reference and sketch them into the painting as a guide with all the large shapes in place switch down to a medium brush and start refining the edges of major forms such as the jaw and large skin creases it may be useful to sketch guidelines into the painting as they can easily be covered up with a new layer step back 10 feet 3 meters from the painting the illusion of light should be very strong you might forget the shadows are only painted add detail to the nose and mouth as with the rest of the body the tongue and nose can be broken down into larger planes to plan out the form once you have them looking as if light is shining on them go in with even finer details to make the snout look wet look at your reference for the placement of small bright hard highlights these are called specular reflections they occur where the light source is being completely reflected off the surface add detail to the eyes note that the white of the eye is rarely white under normal lighting conditions because it is recessed into the head and cast into shadow by the skin around it capturing these shadows is the key to making the eye appear to be set in the face and not just painted on the surface small bright specular highlights give the eye a glassy sparkle add detail to the ears the ears are composed of a few large planes that turn up at the edges be sure to establish the forms before adding graphic elements like spots and remember that the spots are affected by the light and shadow of the plane they are on as well continue adding details until you re satisfied with the results smooth everything out now that all the forms are in place and sufficiently detailed you can go back and blend rough patches of color together if you want a smoother slicker look to the painting keep plane boundaries fairly sharp though or the painting may start to look blurry and flat then step back 10 feet 3 meters from the painting and enjoy the finished product,Pets-and-Animals

how to paint a watercolor cat in a window with a view,this classic indoor outdoor watercolor theme is exactly as it sounds it shows both the inside of a room and the outdoors in one painting this can be done by putting a window or open doorway as part of the composition it is intriguing to viewers to be able to see two views in one painting it is fun for the artist to use the concept of contrast warm vs cool serene vs active natural vs man made etc so paint a sleeping cat on a window sill and have the outdoors be the bigger or at least as big as your cozy cat,draw on an 11 x 14 sheet of watercolor paper in pencil using a ruler a window it can be as simple as a rectangle on the page or ornate with layers of molding or with the panes divided into smaller rectangles these lines must be done carefully to be straight and lined up with the borders of your paper so use a ruler make the window large enough so that you can see an outdoor scene out the window if the holidays are near decorate with swags or colorful ornaments look at pictures of sleeping cats on the internet or if you are so lucky study your own sleeping cat make sketches in a sketch book comprised of ordinary paper so you can draw freely and a lot draw a cat reclining on the good watercolor paper in pencil have him stretched out on the window sill so he covers a lot of it activate your paints and begin painting starting with the foreground the interior view try a flat brush to do the molding and have the width of the brush match the width of the molding so you can do the long strips in one pass stopping to recharge your brush as often as necessary paint the cat by carefully wetting the cat shape with a brush and clean water allow the water to get into all parts of the cat s silhouette and have enough water so it stands up slightly off the page this insures the water will carry the paint to all parts that you have wet pull tube colors for the cat onto your palette and dilute only slightly as the majority of the water is already on the cat shape diluting it too much will make it pale when dry if it dries too light it is possible to do another layer but wait until the piece dries thoroughly not to disturb the paint already applied if the paint isn t moving well enough through the water use the tip of a round brush to coax paint into all parts of the cat if you add more color into a wet wash it has to be thicker paint do spots or stripes on the cat s coat and shadows along his edges that way if you want to keep for example paws separate leave a tiny dry dam of paper around the paw as you paint wet paint will be attracted to wet paper and it will all flow together let it dry thoroughly first naturally then with a hair dryer if desired do features eyes nose whiskers inner ears and more shadows on a dry cat shape paint the window trims such as the sill under the cat and the moldings add additional strips of molding building it up as many window frames have layered moldings again use a ruler for accuracy mix a neutral color darker than the sill and swipe on a shadow under the cat do it only once and leave it alone look for contrasts in planning the outdoor scene that will be seen through the window if your room is predominately warm colors use cool hues for the outside the room will have many lines and angles so think of using curvy lines for the outdoors make things up realism isn t necessarily the only way to go so use your imagination paint the scene outside if you are stymied about what to put outside stick close to home and take a look out your windows go through your collection of snapshots for something that sparks your interest sketch the scene outside the window in pencil and paint it when finished allow to dry well and stand it up to study it before making alterations of additions,Pets-and-Animals
