how to conduct a workshop,learning how to conduct a workshop is important for educators business leaders scientists and other professionals a successful workshop provides participants with new skills information and a sense of accomplishment the ideal workshop also provides opportunities for participants to interact and learn actively,define the workshop objective whether you are teaching a skill delivering information or increasing awareness outline the goals of your workshop what do you want your workshop participants to learn this analysis may result in a list of specific skills you will be teaching concrete topics you will cover or simply a feeling you will inspire in your participants think carefully about what you want to accomplish and why it is important some examples of workshop objectives include learn how to write a persuasive cover letter learn how to break bad news to a patient learn 5 techniques to get a reluctant student to talk in class learn how to create an effective powerpoint presentation decide who your audience is will the workshop participants know one another or are they strangers will they come in with knowledge about your topic or will they be completely unfamiliar with it are they choosing to attend your workshop or is it a requirement for their job training answers to all of these questions will affect how you organize your workshop 1 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source for example if your audience already knows each other you might be able to launch into group activities very quickly if they are complete strangers you might need to schedule extra time for icebreakers and introductions schedule your workshop for the morning or early afternoon these are the times when participants are most awake and alert 2 x research source you want your participants to be fully engaged and aware if you can avoid scheduling evening workshops after the workday when everyone is tired and impatient publicize your workshop pass around flyers hang up posters or contact suitable businesses to encourage workshop participation having a catchy title helps as does a brief explanation for why your workshop is important and necessary be sure to include images as well as text in your flyers to catch people s attention recruit 8 15 participants for your workshop a workshop is not the same as a large lecture you want your group to be small enough to ask all their questions practice their skills and work together but you also want your workshop to be large enough to keep things interesting ideally a workshop will have 8 15 participants 3 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source sometimes you don t have a choice about your group size if you have a very large group find creative ways to make sure the size doesn t become overwhelming for example a group of 40 participants could be divided into 5 different break out groups of 8 participants each you could also bring in co facilitators and co presenters to handle groups that are larger than ideal prepare your participants for the workshop some workshops require that participants do work well before the workshop takes place perhaps they have to study journal articles write a short story or read one another s work if your participants have homework to do before the workshop takes place be sure that your expectations are clearly stated from the beginning be sure to set hard deadlines if your students have to submit work to the group ahead of time be clear about where and how your students should submit their work will they have to give you hard copies or will you circulate materials by email prioritize your goals for the workshop most workshops are time limited they can be as short as 30 minutes or as long as three days but no matter what you will only have a short period of time to impart your knowledge to participants 4 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source rather than covering absolutely everything in a short amount of time think about the most important skills techniques and information you want your audience to gain prioritize those in your lesson plan prepare a variety of teaching aids adults learn in all kinds of ways visually orally through hands on practice or any combination of the above remember that you might not know your participants learning styles ahead of time so you will want to have a variety of materials prepared depending on the topic and objective of your workshop you might want to prepare paper handouts audio visual aids computer based lesson plans and role playing activities prepare paper handouts readings case studies lists of key terms and quizzes are all possible teaching aids you might wish to prepare it is best if you prepare these handouts well ahead of time that way you can catch typos or errors be sure to use a large easy to read font give each document a clear label and date so that your participants will be able to use these handouts in the future if you have lengthy readings consider precirculating these handouts to the group so that they can come in prepared if you are handing out numerous documents consider providing your participants with a folder or binder to keep their papers neat and organized if you give this workshop often enough you might even want to compile your materials into a bound book that you give to your attendees arrange your audio visual materials if you plan to present a slideshow video clips or sound clips you will have to prepare these ahead of time test them at home to make sure they are working correctly make sure that they are in a format that can be used in your workshop space it is wise to consult with your venue s a v technicians to make sure that your materials can be presented properly not all projectors are compatible with macintosh computers for example and some rooms might not have sound projection make sure that your venue can accommodate whatever technology you wish to use organize your computer based materials if your workshop participants will be expected to complete a computerized quiz or participate in an online discussion forum you will need to organize these materials ahead of time think about whether your participants will have to bring in their own personal computers or devices and notify them if so if your participants will be expected to do activities online be sure to consult with your venue s a v technician you will have to make sure that your workshop space is equipped with wireless internet and you might have to ask for the network s password in advance recruit experts speakers and assistants depending on the topic and size of your workshop you might want to bring in other team members to facilitate learning an expert can provide a live demonstration of a new medical technique a guest speaker might be able to tell a lively anecdote about why your workshop topic is important and an assistant might be able to help you manage a large group if you require help from anyone make sure that you recruit them well ahead of time the more prepared they are the better your workshop will be decide on your group activities interaction amongst a group of participants sets a workshop apart from other ways of learning brainstorm educational group activities that are suitable to your workshop s objectives keep in mind that activities can be done in pairs small groups or as a full group make sure that you include enough opportunities for every workshop participant to contribute meaningfully to your workshop some possible group activities include debates break the workshop into two groups and have each group argue for their position think pair shares ask your participants a discussion question have them think about it on their own discuss their thoughts with a partner and then share their conclusions with the full group question and answer sessions if you have a lot of information to present include your attendees in the discussion by allowing them to ask questions about the material you can answer these questions yourself or ask other workshop participants to answer them role playing activities assign participants roles to play in order to practice the new techniques they are learning brainstorming sessions ask your workshop to shout out as many ideas as they can think of write them all down on a chalkboard or whiteboard then ask your workshop to evaluate what they have come up with leave time for breaks people are more focused on tasks when they have the chance to take short breaks 5 x research source they are also more likely to remember what they have learned schedule your workshop plan to include at least one 5 minute break per hour of your workshop this will shorten your time with your participants but will make that time more valuable resist cramming actual activities can often take 10 20 more time than we estimate if you think a q and a session will last 10 minutes it might very well last 12 minutes or longer build in enough time for each major activity or topic you want to cover resist the urge to cram in as much as possible your participants will feel tired and rushed if you are worried that your workshop will end early you can always prepare a couple of optional extra activities that will reinforce learning if you have time for them great and if not no harm done secure catering workshops take a lot of work and energy help keep your participants energy levels up by providing healthy foods and beverages ideally the costs of these snacks will be covered through participant registration fees or by the organization that asked you to lead the workshop you should not have to pay for snacks out of pocket try to avoid junk foods unhealthy foods might give short bursts of energy but then will cause energy crashes very soon that will leave your participants bored and tired aim for energizing healthy snacks such as fruit vegetables hummus and whole grain breads 6 x research source arrive early leave yourself plenty of time to set up the space and get comfortable in the room you might have to meet with a v technicians caterers or your team members before your workshop begins as well give yourself as much time as you can in case you have to troubleshoot or make last minute adjustments to your workshop plan set up all equipment before participants arrive computers laptops projectors and speakers will all have to be fine tuned in advance after all you want your workshop time to be productive you do not want to spend it fiddling with technology if you can see if you can have the venue s a v technician assist you with the set up you might not be familiar with the room s technological capabilities and an expert might be able to set everything up more efficiently arrange the chairs in advance the way you arrange the chairs will depend on the size of your group the size of the room and the activities you have planned ideally the group will be small enough to sit in a circle or semi circle this will help establish rapport and facilitate conversation if everyone will need to look at the front to watch video clips or a live demo perhaps a semi circle or straight rows of seats is more appropriate distribute materials if you have notebooks or other workshop materials to hand out place them on the tables or chairs in advance to save time during the workshop make sure they are in the correct order and that they are clearly labeled other materials you might need to set up in your workshop space include snacks and beverages name tags and markers pens and pencils greet participants as they arrive arriving early allows you to set up relax and get to know participants before the start of the workshop this helps in building relationships with the participants introduce yourself and the workshop once everyone is seated you will have to orient them to your workshop be sure to tell them your name and what they should call you give a few words about why you should be considered an expert in the topic and what got you interested in it explain to your participants what the goal of the workshop is and why it is important it is also a good idea to give a rough outline of how the workshop will be run so that they can be prepared try to limit this segment to just a couple of minutes even if your topic is a serious one consider using humor to lighten the mood and get everyone comfortable with one another explain to your participants what the materials around the room are and what they should do with them for example you can ask people to fill out name tags grab a cup of coffee and make sure they have their handouts if you would rather that your participants not pull out their readings or laptops right away you can tell them when those materials will be needed begin icebreakers ask your participants to introduce themselves limit the introductions to a few sentences by asking everyone to answer two or three specific questions such as their names and what they hope to gain from the workshop you don t want the icebreakers to go on forever but it is important that your attendees feel comfortable talking in front of the group you can also ask everybody to break the ice by answering a light hearted question like what is your favorite movie or what is your favorite bad song execute your lesson plan this is when all of your careful preparations can be put into action have your outline in front of you and try to stick to the outline if you can feel free to tell your participants directly what you are doing and why your lesson plan doesn t have to be a surprise and your participants might appreciate being told why you ve organized the workshop in the way that you did for example you might tell them first we are going to go over our case studies to make sure we understand their nuances after that we will divide into small groups to determine an ideal solution to the problem we re going to spend some time learning key terms that will be useful to you as you learn this new computer program after i explain these terms we ll take a quiz to make sure we are on the same page after that we will open things up for discussion please introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you in a few minutes you will role play a counselor student interaction with your partner be flexible it is good to have a plan for your workshop but be prepared to alter your workshop s content based on the reactions and experiences of the participants build some flex time into your lesson plan so that you can address their questions concerns and interests 7 x research source you can even provide options for activities that your workshop group can vote on this will allow you to focus on what really matters and skip over redundant or unnecessary content use interactive exercises to reinforce information always follow up the delivery of information with the reinforcement of that information through some kind of group activity interactive group work is a particularly effective method to teach problem solving techniques 8 x research source a workshop is not the same thing as a lecture and you want to honor the thoughts and opinions of your workshop participants let them teach each other at the same time that you are teaching them for example you can deliver information in short spurts and then allow participants to ask questions divide participants into groups to complete a task and ask them to report back to the entire group show a video clip and then ask pairs of participants to discuss their reactions provide advice about how to handle a difficult situation and then ask small groups of participants to role play the scenario have an expert demonstrate a technique and then ask your students to take a collaborative quiz about the technique don t talk too much you do not want to micromanage every stage of the workshop your participants might get bored or annoyed 9 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source keep in mind that a workshop is different from a lecture or a typical meeting it is a format that thrives on interaction activity and group work 10 x trustworthy source plos one online peer reviewed open access scientific research journal go to source stick to your scheduled breaks scheduling breaks helps people assimilate the information and reflect let participants know how often they will get breaks and the lengths of the breaks this allows workshop attendees to plan accordingly for restroom usage phone calls and other personal needs do not skip breaks even if you are running short on time switch up activities every 20 30 minutes attention spans begin to wane after 20 minutes of the same activity view this fact as an opportunity for creativity instead of as a problem change up your activities ask your participants to rearrange their chairs or schedule a break at least once every 20 30 minutes to keep everyone engaged and motivated 11 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source lighten the mood even if you are treating a serious topic humor can be a great way to emphasize information and keep everyone attentive 12 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source think about ways that you can introduce humor in a responsible ethical way into your presentations discussions and activities this will also encourage your participants to remain relaxed alert and comfortable maintain a respectful democratic atmosphere make sure that all of your workshop participants are treated equally and respectfully this means that any leadership roles such as group discussion leader should be distributed evenly across the workshop encourage quiet shy participants to speak you want everyone to feel heard and respected similarly you do not want a single participant s voice or your own voice for that matter to dominate the discussion be prepared for the unexpected most workshops will run smoothly after all the participants presumably want to be there and want to learn however there might be scenarios where somebody is unwilling to participate or might be insulting to a colleague be professional no matter what and encourage respectful behavior by modeling respectful behavior 13 x research source be clear in what you expect from your participants if you have a participant who is acting up or trying to bully a colleague consider speaking privately with that person emphasize the importance of what you are teaching and tell them that you expect adult professional behavior from them conclude the workshop with a summary of what they have learned explain everything that your participants have learned over the course of the session this will help emphasize how far they have come and what new skills they have acquired refer explicitly to the objectives you laid out at the beginning of the workshop and explain how you think the participants have met those objectives congratulate your workshop for their hard work and for their new knowledge get feedback immediately after the session design an evaluation form that your participants can fill out in the last few minutes of the workshop be sure that you leave them with enough time to comment and consider your questions carefully immediate feedback not only will help you improve your workshop but will also help reinforce the learning your participants have undertaken 14 x trustworthy source plos one online peer reviewed open access scientific research journal go to source good questions to ask include what is the stated objective of this workshop did the workshop meet its stated objective what activities helped your learning the most the least was the workshop an appropriate length what workshop materials handouts readings quizzes etc were the most useful which ones were the least useful how have you learned or grown from this workshop how do you think your colleagues have learned or grown how would you change this workshop in the future any suggestions for improvements are there any topics that you would like to take a workshop on follow up with the participants a few days or weeks later ask workshop attendees if you may contact them in the future for their input some people need time to reflect back on their workshop experiences following up with workshop participants several days or weeks later might reveal new insights you can ask additional questions such as how well have you retained the information you learned in the workshop do you still find yourself thinking about the workshop how has the workshop helped you at work were there ways it could have helped you more what materials have you found useful since the workshop what materials have you thrown away or forgotten about schedule a follow up workshop if necessary if enough participants are interested in more advanced versions of your workshop consider scheduling a part 2 in the follow up workshop you can address more of their questions dig more deeply into the topic or engage in more advanced versions of the techniques taught in part 1 be sure that your follow up workshop is not too repetitive and that it is suitable for

how to impart stem education to your children,when it comes to technological innovation the united states remains number one yet among 15 year olds worldwide the us ranks 29th in math literacy falling behind finland croatia the czech republic and liechtenstein 1 x research source this means that the us delivers a less than excellent education in science technology engineering and mathematics stem education due to the declining quality of public primary and secondary education as well as an overall lack of financial and societal support only 10 percent of children s tv characters are scientists or engineers 2 x research source fewer young american students are showing an interest in stem education given that so many us students have shied away from stem studies american industry has been forced to continue its practice of outsourcing overseas this business strategy will not change unless a sufficient number of american students pursue college and graduate degrees in the sciences as of late there has been renewed attention to stem education as well initiatives and funding from the white house on its behalf to contribute to this new momentum parents and caregivers can play a significant role in exciting their children about stem education and its professional possibilities what are the steps in taking this proactive approach this article will help you to get your children more involved in stem education and loving it too font 1 note while this article relates in particular to the us situation the need to boost stem education is similar in many anglo countries and the methods outlined here are of great benefit to children in these countries too,discover your child s natural affinity and academic aptitude every child s constitution is different and even though the theory of neuroplasticity tells us that the human brain can adapt to almost anything some children are able to learn about the sciences more easily than others since it s clear that different forms of knowledge exercise different parts of the brain some students will probably require a little more time and effort than others to learn the same academic subject as a parent or caregiver it is most important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your child support him or her through the process and to try to alleviate unnecessary stress provide an environment that will instill a healthy balance among your child s iq intelligence quotient eq emotional quotient and pq physical and physiological quotient fundamental for your child is the pq a child will not be able to learn if he or she is hungry tired or indisposed eq also plays a very important role in a child s academic success if a child feels emotionally deprived he or she will not be able to learn iq blooms only when pq and eq are supported to be their best teach children about the ways in which science and technology add value to the quality of human lives if children understand all of the wonderful things technology has done and can do for example the cell phone the internet video games cures for diseases for example then they are much more likely to get excited about what they can achieve by pursuing an education in science and technology make sure children can relate to the examples you pick talk about curing illnesses rather than relating technological progress to something like cancer stem cell research young children will not understand highly technical language if you can base your discussion of scientific progress in a story about someone or something a child is already familiar with such as a family member or friend who has been ill your message will be much more effective create a science and technology environment outside of school this can be accomplished in many ways view science and technology tv channels with your child engage in discussions about what you viewed afterward try an experiment that you saw demonstrated on tv or in a video part of the fun can be gathering the items needed to perform it as well as setting up the experimental lab conduct internet searches on performing fun experiments there are many sites dedicated to science projects for kids make home experiments fun occasions organize groups of kids to participate at your home in your backyard garage or another safe place join or organize science and technology s t related groups on social networks like facebook and linkedin in order to brainstorm with other parents and caregivers you might even be in contact with teachers in s t through these online communities find or start a supplementary school like the saturday math school in a boston suburb established by russian immigrants 3 x research source become a member of the local science museum and keep a watch on activities for kids incorporate regular visits into your family s activities use building blocks puzzles and games for family activities leave these in obvious places so that kids pick them up play with them and view them as part of their everyday surroundings most importantly engage in conversation about science related topics with children in way that pertains to everyday life experiences bring science and technology closer to life by pointing out its daily applications help children understand how science and technology have led to such things as running water electricity and cars create a before and after scenario in order for your child to realize that people did not always have running water electricity or cars by explaining the history of technology your child will begin to comprehend that technology is related to progress and serves a very important purpose in day to day living on a regular basis conduct a task analysis in relation to metacognition standards this way you can help teachers correctly evaluate the cognitive abilities of your child and match the mode of instruction to his or her skill level explain that science and technology can lead to fame and monetary gain appeal to children s fantasies and tempt them provide examples of great scientists and achievers you can easily find examples by conducting an online search consider making a home project out of researching the lives of famous scientists and innovators show your child how to find age appropriate resources on the web or in books and magazines to find interesting facts have him or her report back with findings work with your child to create a poster powerpoint video or interactive presentation why not use technological media to display knowledge about science and technology teach critical inquiry skills to your child in the early stages of his or her life start by demonstrating how to observe ask questions create hypotheses and test those hypotheses inquiry is the basis of science math and technological activity when one is interested in how something works inquires into it and then makes discoveries the desire to learn more ignites curiosity leading to inquiry provides the best foundation for perpetual self improvement through study and experimentation encourage children to ask questions try not to brush aside their queries even if they don t make sense or are not good questions turn the bad question into an interesting and relevant question and then engage in discussion you don t necessarily need to know all of the answers an important part of the process is helping your children learn how to find answers themselves through your guidance,Education-and-Communications
how to make an open educational resource,open educational resource oer is something for teaching or learning from that has been created to share freely online it could be a lesson a quiz a whole project or anything else that helps stimulate learning or inspire teaching getting started on making an oer can feel like a daunting task but it needn t feel this way reusable simple and desirable oer can be produced in just a few hours based on your existing knowledge and know how the suggested approach here provides a foundation for a small oer approximately 4 hours of activities but is designed to scale the longer you allow it to develop and the more ingredients you put in the bigger the resource can become,crack open your idea and mix in the creativity you ll be coming to this development with an idea it could be anything take that idea and flip it on its head think to yourself this idea would never work as an x then challenge yourself and make it work or take a random idea generator examples are explored below in part 3 the step commencing with immerse yourself think whether your activity could be inspired by something in that resource alternatively look around you and find a random item e g a spoon and apply it to the learning activity you have in mind e g cultural analysis and comparison through the use of a culture s cutlery or poetry about common objects displayed in their shape to make interesting art works choose a suitable platform when making an oer you need to think not only about the suitability of the delivery platform for the initial intended content use but also its suitability for future re use delivery needs to be open freely accessible no password protection and ideally editable at the very least able to be copied you do not need to always make a new website you could develop and upload a text based document create a bank of new images in an existing space edit an existing space like a wiki create a closed resource but share how you made it openly through social media or you could develop a new webpage these are just a few examples give yourself plenty of time good learning resources often take a lot of time to develop through reflection and sourcing content this is especially true with oers as finding open content or authoring your own images and text etc can take a lot of time that said it s well worth the effort often you will find yourself stumbling upon something new and unexpected through your development journey in turn this may inspire you to decide to completely change what you initially had in mind no worries just run with it the time you had spent up to then was not wasted it helped you achieve your new and exciting plan do not fear the not yet tried things can seem scary then you put flowers in it be prepared to take risks and try something new you have nothing to lose but a lot to gain from giving a new idea a go immerse yourself learning resources are everywhere and so are ideas for new ones jump in at the deep end and fully immerse yourself in different spaces and resources for inspiration and potentially sourcing content check out the following ideas blogs mailing lists stumble upon websites moocs oer and cc content banks and search engines online articles social media etc often the first jump is the hardest then it s a lot of fun recycle repurpose reuse do not feel like you have to make everything from scratch there are loads of great ideas and resources out there available for use in a new context it is important to note that content can be used in various ways if forming part of the core activity open access content can be pulled out and reused directly partially or simply be inspiring there is also the opportunity to use or sign post to other non cc content providing you have

convictions form a reasonable argument you will have to explain your decision many times to many different people before you have those conversations be sure that you can make a reasoned clear argument for taking the path that you are taking for example i am not being served by this educational system i am not challenged interested or inspired by the curriculum or the educators i am choosing to drop out of high school so that i can pursue higher education on my own and find an educational institution that fits my academic goals for example i am choosing to drop out because i feel like i have no other choice to make up the work and education i missed by being absent for so many days i would have to attend school for another year my grades are so low that i may not be eligible for a diploma even if i do all of the work i am supposed to do i will be much better off if i can just leave get my ged and start working for example i am choosing to leave school so that i can work full time while this decision may not make sense to you i know the needs of myself and my family and having the money to feed my family and myself is more important than learning about academic things that may never affect my life ask about alternative high schools many school districts offer an alternative or independent high school this is often a school with more flexible times and a different mindset the students who attend alternative high schools can be more mature and often work if much of your complaint about high school is the environment and the students an alternative high school may be a better fit for you alternative high schools will sometimes allow you to accelerate your courses and finish early make a plan for your future before you set the dropping out plan in motion you should know what you are going to do instead of high school you most likely will try to get a ged or high school equivalency it is important to do this as soon as possible while you are still in school mode if you plan to leave high school to start college or a vocational program be sure you can enter the program you wish to enter with a high school equivalency if you are planning to go to work full time be sure you have a job lined up first find out how many hours you will be able to work and ask about benefits like health and dental insurance anticipate others arguments the best way to be ready to answer the questions and handle the are you sure responses that you will likely get from the adults in your life is to anticipate their questions before they ask them try to preview the conversations before they happen and come up with responses to arguments and questions that will likely be asked talk to your guardians even if you are 18 and can legally make your own decision it is considerate to tell the people who have been responsible for you up to this point what decision you are making preferably before you make it official tell them your reasons but don t expect them to necessarily agree right away it may take some time for the idea to sink in and they may never think it is a good idea but if you are clear and firm they will likely respect your decision have a back up plan in place the worst case scenario is that your guardians may kick you out of the house if you drop out if you think this may happen have somewhere to go at least temporarily tell your guidance counselor visit your guidance counselor and tell him her your plans be sure to present him her with your reasoning your plans for the future and your guardians response to your decision even if it wasn t favorable determine the legal age for leaving school every state is a little different so make sure you know at what age you re legally allowed to quit school some states allow students to drop out at 16 while others will not allow you to make that decision until you re 18 though you can drop out with a legal guardian s consent if you re younger than the established age in some states other states will not allow you to drop out before the age of 18 even with your guardian s consent make sure you know this information before dropping out 4 x research source you can find your state s legal age requirements here don t just stop going to school even though you re considered a drop out if you just stop going to school altogether the action of doing so without consulting the proper legal channels can have legal ramifications for you and your legal guardians 5 x research source simply no longer attending school is referred to as truancy in legal terms it can lead to fines and community service for you and or your legal guardians becoming truant may stand in your way of receiving a high school equivalency understand the testing requirements for drop outs in your state in some states you might be allowed to legally leave school early if your legal guardians agree and if you pass a high school equivalency test or get a ged make sure to research if your state adopts this policy 6 x research source talk to your guidance counselor or administrative advisor about the required paperwork each state and school district has different forms that you and your parents need to fill out make sure to consult with the appropriate person at your school to find out which documents need to be filed and when they have to be returned be aware that your guidance counselor may try to talk you out of your decision be prepared to offer your reasons for making your decision and be confident in your decision consider online schools and home schooling these options if pursued with a measure of dedication will earn you a diploma while allowing you to do it at your own pace and without the social encumbrances associated with high school think about work study programs this could be a great option that you can work on with your school s staff if there s a particular field of work you re interested in you might consider a work study program not only would you be able to finish school but you might end up graduating with job options 7 x research source consider gateway programs and junior community colleges you might also look into early admission into junior community college through a gateway program at your school if you have enough credits certain high schools will allow you to transfer to a community junior college think about what you d like to do for a living if you ve decided that any kind of academic environment is wrong for you you might want to start thinking about technical career paths get a ged or certificate of high school proficiency a ged general education development often referred to a high school equivalency degree is an exam that you can take to show employers that you have the education of someone with a high school diploma without having to go to school 8 x research source a certificate of high school proficiency is something awarded by the california department of education to students who pass the california high school proficiency exam

how to conduct a workshop,learning how to conduct a workshop is important for educators business leaders scientists and other professionals a successful workshop provides participants with new skills information and a sense of accomplishment the ideal workshop also provides opportunities for participants to interact and learn actively,define the workshop objective whether you are teaching a skill delivering information or increasing awareness outline the goals of your workshop what do you want your workshop participants to learn this analysis may result in a list of specific skills you will be teaching concrete topics you will cover or simply a feeling you will inspire in your participants think carefully about what you want to accomplish and why it is important some examples of workshop objectives include learn how to write a persuasive cover letter learn how to break bad news to a patient learn 5 techniques to get a reluctant student to talk in class learn how to create an effective powerpoint presentation decide who your audience is will the workshop participants know one another or are they strangers will they come in with knowledge about your topic or will they be completely unfamiliar with it are they choosing to attend your workshop or is it a requirement for their job training answers to all of these questions will affect how you organize your workshop 1 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source for example if your audience already knows each other you might be able to launch into group activities very quickly if they are complete strangers you might need to schedule extra time for icebreakers and introductions schedule your workshop for the morning or early afternoon these are the times when participants are most awake and alert 2 x research source you want your participants to be fully engaged and aware if you can avoid scheduling evening workshops after the workday when everyone is tired and impatient publicize your workshop pass around flyers hang up posters or contact suitable businesses to encourage workshop participation having a catchy title helps as does a brief explanation for why your workshop is important and necessary be sure to include images as well as text in your flyers to catch people s attention recruit 8 15 participants for your workshop a workshop is not the same as a large lecture you want your group to be small enough to ask all their questions practice their skills and work together but you also want your workshop to be large enough to keep things interesting ideally a workshop will have 8 15 participants 3 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source sometimes you don t have a choice about your group size if you have a very large group find creative ways to make sure the size doesn t become overwhelming for example a group of 40 participants could be divided into 5 different break out groups of 8 participants each you could also bring in co facilitators and co presenters to handle groups that are larger than ideal prepare your participants for the workshop some workshops require that participants do work well before the workshop takes place perhaps they have to study journal articles write a short story or read one another s work if your participants have homework to do before the workshop takes place be sure that your expectations are clearly stated from the beginning be sure to set hard deadlines if your students have to submit work to the group ahead of time be clear about where and how your students should submit their work will they have to give you hard copies or will you circulate materials by email prioritize your goals for the workshop most workshops are time limited they can be as short as 30 minutes or as long as three days but no matter what you will only have a short period of time to impart your knowledge to participants 4 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source rather than covering absolutely everything in a short amount of time think about the most important skills techniques and information you want your audience to gain prioritize those in your lesson plan prepare a variety of teaching aids adults learn in all kinds of ways visually orally through hands on practice or any combination of the above remember that you might not know your participants learning styles ahead of time so you will want to have a variety of materials prepared depending on the topic and objective of your workshop you might want to prepare paper handouts audio visual aids computer based lesson plans and role playing activities prepare paper handouts readings case studies lists of key terms and quizzes are all possible teaching aids you might wish to prepare it is best if you prepare these handouts well ahead of time that way you can catch typos or errors be sure to use a large easy to read font give each document a clear label and date so that your participants will be able to use these handouts in the future if you have lengthy readings consider precirculating these handouts to the group so that they can come in prepared if you are handing out numerous documents consider providing your participants with a folder or binder to keep their papers neat and organized if you give this workshop often enough you might even want to compile your materials into a bound book that you give to your attendees arrange your audio visual materials if you plan to present a slideshow video clips or sound clips you will have to prepare these ahead of time test them at home to make sure they are working correctly make sure that they are in a format that can be used in your workshop space it is wise to consult with your venue s a v technicians to make sure that your materials can be presented properly not all projectors are compatible with macintosh computers for example and some rooms might not have sound projection make sure that your venue can accommodate whatever technology you wish to use organize your computer based materials if your workshop participants will be expected to complete a computerized quiz or participate in an online discussion forum you will need to organize these materials ahead of time think about whether your participants will have to bring in their own personal computers or devices and notify them if so if your participants will be expected to do activities online be sure to consult with your venue s a v technician you will have to make sure that your workshop space is equipped with wireless internet and you might have to ask for the network s password in advance recruit experts speakers and assistants depending on the topic and size of your workshop you might want to bring in other team members to facilitate learning an expert can provide a live demonstration of a new medical technique a guest speaker might be able to tell a lively anecdote about why your workshop topic is important and an assistant might be able to help you manage a large group if you require help from anyone make sure that you recruit them well ahead of time the more prepared they are the better your workshop will be decide on your group activities interaction amongst a group of participants sets a workshop apart from other ways of learning brainstorm educational group activities that are suitable to your workshop s objectives keep in mind that activities can be done in pairs small groups or as a full group make sure that you include enough opportunities for every workshop participant to contribute meaningfully to your workshop some possible group activities include debates break the workshop into two groups and have each group argue for their position think pair shares ask your participants a discussion question have them think about it on their own discuss their thoughts with a partner and then share their conclusions with the full group question and answer sessions if you have a lot of information to present include your attendees in the discussion by allowing them to ask questions about the material you can answer these questions yourself or ask other workshop participants to answer them role playing activities assign participants roles to play in order to practice the new techniques they are learning brainstorming sessions ask your workshop to shout out as many ideas as they can think of write them all down on a chalkboard or whiteboard then ask your workshop to evaluate what they have come up with leave time for breaks people are more focused on tasks when they have the chance to take short breaks 5 x research source they are also more likely to remember what they have learned schedule your workshop plan to include at least one 5 minute break per hour of your workshop this will shorten your time with your participants but will make that time more valuable resist cramming actual activities can often take 10 20 more time than we estimate if you think a q and a session will last 10 minutes it might very well last 12 minutes or longer build in enough time for each major activity or topic you want to cover resist the urge to cram in as much as possible your participants will feel tired and rushed if you are worried that your workshop will end early you can always prepare a couple of optional extra activities that will reinforce learning if you have time for them great and if not no harm done secure catering workshops take a lot of work and energy help keep your participants energy levels up by providing healthy foods and beverages ideally the costs of these snacks will be covered through participant registration fees or by the organization that asked you to lead the workshop you should not have to pay for snacks out of pocket try to avoid junk foods unhealthy foods might give short bursts of energy but then will cause energy crashes very soon that will leave your participants bored and tired aim for energizing healthy snacks such as fruit vegetables hummus and whole grain breads 6 x research source arrive early leave yourself plenty of time to set up the space and get comfortable in the room you might have to meet with a v technicians caterers or your team members before your workshop begins as well give yourself as much time as you can in case you have to troubleshoot or make last minute adjustments to your workshop plan set up all equipment before participants arrive computers laptops projectors and speakers will all have to be fine tuned in advance after all you want your workshop time to be productive you do not want to spend it fiddling with technology if you can see if you can have the venue s a v technician assist you with the set up you might not be familiar with the room s technological capabilities and an expert might be able to set everything up more efficiently arrange the chairs in advance the way you arrange the chairs will depend on the size of your group the size of the room and the activities you have planned ideally the group will be small enough to sit in a circle or semi circle this will help establish rapport and facilitate conversation if everyone will need to look at the front to watch video clips or a live demo perhaps a semi circle or straight rows of seats is more appropriate distribute materials if you have notebooks or other workshop materials to hand out place them on the tables or chairs in advance to save time during the workshop make sure they are in the correct order and that they are clearly labeled other materials you might need to set up in your workshop space include snacks and beverages name tags and markers pens and pencils greet participants as they arrive arriving early allows you to set up relax and get to know participants before the start of the workshop this helps in building relationships with the participants introduce yourself and the workshop once everyone is seated you will have to orient them to your workshop be sure to tell them your name and what they should call you give a few words about why you should be considered an expert in the topic and what got you interested in it explain to your participants what the goal of the workshop is and why it is important it is also a good idea to give a rough outline of how the workshop will be run so that they can be prepared try to limit this segment to just a couple of minutes even if your topic is a serious one consider using humor to lighten the mood and get everyone comfortable with one another explain to your participants what the materials around the room are and what they should do with them for example you can ask people to fill out name tags grab a cup of coffee and make sure they have their handouts if you would rather that your participants not pull out their readings or laptops right away you can tell them when those materials will be needed begin icebreakers ask your participants to introduce themselves limit the introductions to a few sentences by asking everyone to answer two or three specific questions such as their names and what they hope to gain from the workshop you don t want the icebreakers to go on forever but it is important that your attendees feel comfortable talking in front of the group you can also ask everybody to break the ice by answering a light hearted question like what is your favorite movie or what is your favorite bad song execute your lesson plan this is when all of your careful preparations can be put into action have your outline in front of you and try to stick to the outline if you can feel free to tell your participants directly what you are doing and why your lesson plan doesn t have to be a surprise and your participants might appreciate being told why you ve organized the workshop in the way that you did for example you might tell them first we are going to go over our case studies to make sure we understand their nuances after that we will divide into small groups to determine an ideal solution to the problem we re going to spend some time learning key terms that will be useful to you as you learn this new computer program after i explain these terms we ll take a quiz to make sure we are on the same page after that we will open things up for discussion please introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you in a few minutes you will role play a counselor student interaction with your partner be flexible it is good to have a plan for your workshop but be prepared to alter your workshop s content based on the reactions and experiences of the participants build some flex time into your lesson plan so that you can address their questions concerns and interests 7 x research source you can even provide options for activities that your workshop group can vote on this will allow you to focus on what really matters and skip over redundant or unnecessary content use interactive exercises to reinforce information always follow up the delivery of information with the reinforcement of that information through some kind of group activity interactive group work is a particularly effective method to teach problem solving techniques 8 x research source a workshop is not the same thing as a lecture and you want to honor the thoughts and opinions of your workshop participants let them teach each other at the same time that you are teaching them for example you can deliver information in short spurts and then allow participants to ask questions divide participants into groups to complete a task and ask them to report back to the entire group show a video clip and then ask pairs of participants to discuss their reactions provide advice about how to handle a difficult situation and then ask small groups of participants to role play the scenario have an expert demonstrate a technique and then ask your students to take a collaborative quiz about the technique don t talk too much you do not want to micromanage every stage of the workshop your participants might get bored or annoyed 9 x trustworthy source

different from a lecture or a typical meeting it is a format that thrives on interaction activity and group work 10 x trustworthy source plos one online peer reviewed open access scientific research journal go to source stick to your scheduled breaks scheduling breaks helps people assimilate the information and reflect let participants know how often they will get breaks and the lengths of the breaks this allows workshop attendees to plan accordingly for restroom usage phone calls and other personal needs do not skip breaks even if you are running short on time switch up activities every 20 30 minutes attention spans begin to wane after 20 minutes of the same activity view this fact as an opportunity for creativity instead of as a problem change up your activities ask your participants to rearrange their chairs or schedule a break at least once every 20 30 minutes to keep everyone engaged and motivated 11 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and

this means that any leadership roles such as group discussion leader should be distributed evenly across the workshop encourage quiet shy participants to speak you want everyone to feel heard and respected similarly you do not want a single participant s voice or your own voice for that matter to dominate the discussion be prepared for the unexpected most workshops will run smoothly after all the participants presumably want to be there and want to learn however there might be scenarios where somebody is unwilling to participate or might be insulting to a colleague be professional no matter what and encourage respectful behavior by modeling respectful behavior 13 x research source be clear in what you expect from your participants if you have a participant who is acting up or trying to bully a colleague consider speaking privately with that person emphasize the importance of what you are teaching and tell them that you expect adult professional behavior from them conclude

this workshop in the future any suggestions for improvements are there any topics that you would like to take a workshop on follow up with the participants a few days or weeks later ask workshop attendees if you may contact them in the future for their input some people need time to reflect back on their workshop experiences following up with workshop participants several days or weeks later might reveal new insights you can ask additional questions such as how well have you retained the information you learned in the workshop do you still find yourself thinking about the workshop how has the workshop helped you at work were there ways it could have helped you more what materials have you found useful since the workshop what materials have you thrown away or forgotten about schedule a follow up workshop if necessary if enough participants are interested in more advanced versions of your workshop consider scheduling a part 2 in the follow up workshop you can address more of their questions dig more deeply into the topic or engage in more advanced versions of the techniques taught in part 1 be sure that your follow up workshop is not too repetitive and that it is suitable for

how to create study guides,study guides are tools that can help reduce the stress of a test if you re covering a lot of material it may seem intimidating to consolidate all of the information into one helpful guide however with a few tricks for sorting information and finding a design that works for you you can ace your next test and prepare for any exam in the future,make the form match the function there are many different types of study guides each formatted to suit different subject types and learning styles whatever you re reviewing for there s a study guide not only right for the subject but for your particular needs in learning that subject organize the information into the most user friendly study guide you can if you re a visual learner consider using color coded sections in your study guides or using idea mapping to draw out the information and make it more quickly accessible 1 x research source if you ve got a linear mind organize the information chronologically or alphabetically so you can make learn one thing in a series and then move on to the next 2 x research source if you need to connect to information emotionally to understand it organize your notes into narrative form to study it better translate concepts from math into a story that you can connect to then organize your study guide like a short story you can recite to remember the application of the formulas if you can memorize information quickly use a format that will help you memorize efficiently whether it be recording yourself reciting vocab words and definitions then listening back on your ipod throughout the day or by creating flash cards and testing yourself regularly draw concept maps to connect main ideas and prioritize information concept maps involve writing each main idea into a separate box which is connected according to their chronology or importance then connect branches of associated information stemming from the main ideas 3 x research source this study guide method provides a good visual of how subject material fits together to make a whole concept an example of a concept map for a history chapter on space flight might involve the space race as the main heading which would branch off into separate categories for the united states and the soviet union with trailing data about specific missions projects successes and failures a formal outline as you re sometimes expected to write for an essay assignment is an example of a concept map if outlining works for you and organizes information in a way you find useful outline the info to study formal outlines can make excellent study guides but only if you find them easy to write out if it would be stressful to make one find another solution diagrams of technical information can help to visually represent processes or procedures that take place by way of a series of defined steps these start with a main concept and are organized from left to right in a way that highlights important key factors in the order in which they must happen timelines are good for outlining a series of chronological events most often used for subjects like history politics and biology when you re studying it can be helpful to prioritize studying broad facts formulas and concepts and the relationships between them then it will be easier to remember things like historical dates names and other details 4 x expert source ted coopersmith mba academic tutor expert interview 10 july 2020 use comparison charts to highlight the differences in key concepts create study guides using comparison charts or tables when it is necessary to compare and contrast a related group of ideas you might use tables to organize particular parallels in history or biology or to compare different writers for a literature course for example a comparison chart collecting different plant species might have the names of various plants in different column headers with the plants kingdom family and genus in rows underneath this will help organize the information for quick comparison and review you could also make use of comparison charts when you re studying literature setting up different characters in a novel in different columns with attributes or other information under each likewise information from two different novels might be nicely organized in a comparison table like this use flash cards or concept cards to memorize vocabulary flash cards are generally created using blank 5 x 7 inch index cards and may contain as much or as little information as you wish though they tend to be most effective for memorizing individual words or defining specific concepts for this reason they re especially effective for studying languages and history write 1 key concept on the front of each index card and then on the back of the cards write whatever fact s you d like to associate with the key concepts cycle through the cards yourself or have someone quiz you using the cards to make sure you ve really got things memorized go forwards and backwards starting with the front of the card then with the back this works especially well for foreign language vocabulary write your own sample test to study writing up a practice test can be an excellent way to make you analyze the content you ll be tested over from two perspectives if you think about what would be good to include on the test you ll be thinking like the teacher and if you can anticipate those questions you ll be one step ahead try to find out if you ll be given a multiple choice test fill in the blank or required to answer essay questions prepare accordingly by writing questions of the sort you ll be tested over use your study materials to help you write the questions try to think of it in terms of what an instructor might ask you then write out the answer to those questions the way you would on your test 5 x expert source ted coopersmith mba academic tutor expert interview 10 july 2020 many teachers will be willing to provide old versions of the test if they re available for you to use as a study guide textbooks will often include sample tests that are an excellent way of studying while it may seem extra stressful to take the test more than once it can be a great way of studying and might even clue you into which questions will be on the test if you re studying with another student from your class set aside some time for each of you to make up an exam then trade the exams with each other and try to answer each other s questions that way you ll be more sure you haven t glossed over anything important 6 x expert source ted coopersmith mba academic tutor expert interview 10 july 2020 study multiple study guides create a study guide in a combination of formats using the main concepts and supporting information you pulled from your study materials you may draft the guides on paper by hand or use a computer word processing spreadsheet or specialized study guide program to organize your information some students find that re writing notes and organizing the information into hand written study guides forces your mind to connect more physically with the information when compared with typing while rote recopying of notes has no effect on memory actively reading and rewriting information can help you double up on the studying you ve read through the info once when reading and again when writing 7 x research source alternatively if you struggle with hard to read handwriting or simply prefer working on the computer feel free to type out your study guide make it as graphically interesting as you want and print out copies or read through it on your mobile device ask your teacher about what information the test will include the first place to start studying is by talking to your instructor professor teacher or ta to direct your efforts and attention to the correct place if it isn t a major part of class discussions make sure you find out what information discussed read and covered throughout class this particular test will include some courses are cumulative meaning the information and skills in class accumulate over the course of the semester while some courses wait to test over all the material until the final examination testing instead over isolated topics or chapters make sure to ask your teacher about the specific content on the upcoming exam for which you re studying and only study that information when in doubt about what to study emphasize studying new information or skills while teachers may delight in throwing an old question at you to test your memory it s more likely you ll only be tested over the most recent chapters lectures and information most teachers don t want to trick you go through your textbook and other reading materials depending on the class for which you re studying the most important source of information is likely the textbook and the associated reading assignments for the class many textbooks will have already bolded or otherwise emphasized the most important main concepts skills and ideas for you to study making them excellent resources for study guides re read materials to isolate the main ideas to include in your study guide when reviewing it s probably not necessary to read every word of a particular chapter instead scan for the main concepts to remind yourself and mark this information for inclusion on your study guide this in itself makes for a good first step in reviewing for a test look for chapter review or study questions to guide the content of your study guide if a textbook lists possible questions or comprehension checks copy them into your notes to include in your study guide even if the teacher doesn t base tests on the textbook knowing the information extra thoroughly is an excellent way to review for the questions that might be asked gather and translate your class notes compile all your lecture notes from class including any handouts or other supplementary materials that the teacher has provided you depending on the focus and content of the course class notes can be just as important if not more so than the textbook and assigned readings 8 x research source sometimes notes taken in class can be messy confusing and otherwise difficult to review making a study guide more like an all inclusive and clean version of your class notes save a bit of time for recopying not word for word but taking the main concepts and important ideas the teacher discussed from your notes translate them into a concise set for your study guide if you re not a great note taker ask a classmate if you might review their notes being extra careful to care for them and return them in a timely manner return the favor in the future by taking closer notes and letting your friend use them for review seek out additional definitions explanations and resources sometimes for particular subjects outside research might be helpful or even necessary if your notes and the text don t do enough to ensure that you fully understand a concept skill or fact do additional research to clarify important terms that you don t understand fully exploring a particular concept will make sure you ve got a unique perspective and understanding of it for the test if you re studying for a final exam be sure to collect your previous tests study guides and handouts these can make for excellent study guides focus on the main concepts in each chapter and lecture identify the most important concepts in a particular section or chapter and make sure you understand those at the cost of more specific but less important information depending on the subject some specific details like dates formulas or definitions may be important but the skill or topic is more important when reviewing for math or science make sure to have necessary formulas memorized if need be but make applying those formulas the more important study focus understand how to use the formula and when to use it the concept behind the formula is more important than the formula itself this goes as well for physics chemistry or other science courses in which it s helpful to create practical examples that apply the material to real life situations when reviewing for english make sure you know all the characters names in the book you ll be tested over but focus more on the plot the significance of the story and other themes in the reading rather than specific details if you have to refer to the main character s sister in an essay test because you forgot the name it won t matter much if your essay is thoughtful and well written otherwise when reviewing for history it s common to spend a considerable amount of time memorizing key facts and vocabulary words but it s also important to understand the themes of the period of history you re studying and the reason those facts are important understand the relationship between all the names and dates and you ll be in even better shape prioritize information condense all of the study materials into manageable sections that will make studying more convenient than looking through the entire chapter use bold headings for different sections of information and consider organizing things into a bulleted list to access it quickly and efficiently identify explain and demonstrate the relationships between ideas and concepts in sub steps on your study guide or by grouping your study guides into linked packets of info that you can study together if you re reviewing for a history final it might make sense to bind all the war sections into one study group or all the information on various presidents to look for the common themes include everything you ll need to study then carry it around with you all the time if you make sure that everything you ll need for the test is included in your study guide you can leave your textbook at home and carry around your handful of papers instead this is especially important for cumulative exams in which you ll be tested over a lot of information going through all the individual chapters could be overwhelming while going through your thorough notes will be quick and effective pull out your study guide on the bus or while you re watching tv and just flip through it the more often you do hospital rounds of the testing information the closer you ll be to memorizing it highlight difficult material to return to before the test if you re having trouble remembering a particular formula or getting a concept down highlight it in a designated color like blue and continue studying the rest of the material when you study again start with everything highlighted blue and make sure you ve got it down before the test this can be an excellent way of reminding you not only what you need to learn but give you specific goals to accomplish in your studying study in more than one place some studies show that changing the location of your study can help increase your ability to memorize information in other words if you do nothing but study in your bedroom it may be more difficult to remember the information than if you studied a bit in your bedroom a bit in the backyard a bit in the lunch room during school 9 x research source schedule your studying create your study guides as early as possible and set aside enough time to study them before the test sneaks up on you in the few weeks before the test divide up your time for all the different subjects and sections of each subject you ll need to study to make sure you ve got enough time to spend on each individual area of information don t cram everything in at the last minute if you struggle with stress anxiety and tend to panic before tests it can be an especially good idea to get ahead of the game and set deadlines for particular chapters or topics if you know that you ve got to cover the first two chapters this week before moving on to 3 and 4 the following week it means you ll have a whole week to devote to that time and you won t be able to stress about what s in 3 and 4 until later put your studies in different compartments and only focus on one at a time don t switch back and forth between five different subjects until you ve studied for one and completed it 10 x research source,Education-and-Communications

research source the india times le monde the asahi shimbun the new york times the guardian washington post take notes about key areas jot down notes about areas of the world that you are interested in these notes can be a solid foundation for your later research for example let s say that you have just read an article about isis if you write down details about the countries isis occupies such as iraq and libya then you can find out more about how the current situation started stay critical do not necessarily take everything you read at face value notice the biases and omissions of different newspapers instead of simply taking in talking points listen to news radio tune in to a news radio broadcast the bbc and npr are both good places to get solid world news since both are publicly funded

as well these books supply even more information about the topics that you have read about in magazines go to museums look at art pieces and engage with what you see try to take your time with several pieces as you look at these art objects try to comprehend what makes them special and individual this should take time art appreciation is about contemplation 3 x research source engage with each art object with a different lens a painting is different from a photograph and vice versa you should not look at a contemporary work in the same way that you would look at a classical one therefore a contemporary oil painting deserves a different way of seeing than an oil painting from three hundred years ago remember that periods matter as do movements take a tour the guide will tell you

notepad handy so you can scribble down notes about the themes and ideas in these texts you don t want to get bogged down in every last detail writing down the most significant portion of what you ve read is a great way to avoid becoming lost as you try to tackle these important works watch films try to watch art house films there are many excellent films out there take the opportunity to watch a few of them if it helps try to pick one director and watch as much of their filmography as possible then read criticism about films that you have seen when you do this you will be able to pick up on how that director decides to edit and shoot their films read criticism read magazines like sight and sound and cahiers du cinema both have contemporary art house film reviews and essays they also publish articles about older classic films by film scholars the av club is also a great resource on films both old and new individual critics websites can be helpful as well listen to music of course you probably listen to music however if you don t already listen to a variety of different genres you should try listening to a type of music that you haven t listened to before for example if you mainly listen to rock music you should try listening to classical or if you only listen to classical try listening to rock music you want to have a diverse range of musical tastes this shows that you are willing to explore talk to people who are reasonably educated get into conversations with people who have learned whether through school or work a great deal about life speak to them and try to understand how they obtained that knowledge ask them questions about subjects that you don t understand talk to people from a variety of professions education takes its form in a variety of ways an educated man realizes this your mechanic can as knowledgeable as your professor go to public lectures find out if a scholar or writer is giving a talk in your neighborhood go to the talk and listen to what they have to say often after a talk a question and answer session is held not only will you learn about a subject but you will also be able to ask the lecturer questions directly again try to take accurate notes this will make it easier for you to come up with good stimulating questions that will allow for an invigorating discussion of course don t tire yourself writing down every word remember you just want to mark down key concepts and ideas stay open minded during the course of your conversations you will almost certainly end up disagreeing with the person you are conversing with try to understand their viewpoint this does not mean that you need to agree with everything you hear this would be foolish however an educated man does not dismiss someone based on a disagreement actually arguments and debates show that you are willing to entertain ideas that are different from your own they help you to develop your own point of view if you disagree with a perspective you could say i see why you would think this however i have a different take on the matter keep your composure the mark of an educated man is a calm exterior 6 x research source don t be quick to anger for example don t start screaming because someone has angered you simply react calmly and try to resolve the issue you don t necessarily need to disguise your emotions you might be angry but don t let that feeling affect the way you behave if you find yourself becoming angry try to center yourself meditation is a good way to do this speak in a level tone of voice don t raise your voice you should still talk to people but you do not want to be loudest person in the room as this can make it seem like you are trying to call attention to yourself however you don t want to be too quiet either if you are very quiet you may seem timid an educated man will aim to strike a balance in his speech be humble an educated man is well mannered and gentle try to avoid seeming arrogant or braggadocios contribute to the conversation by putting forth your point of view but do this selectively after all you don t need to show off your learning in every social situation ask questions when you don t understand something ask for an explanation don t be afraid to do this this shows that you are willing to learn it is better to make a mistake while learning something new than to remain in ignorance due to a fear of embarrassing oneself an inquisitive mind is an intelligent one if you did not understand a point say would you mind explaining your last point again,Education-and-Communications
how to make learning fun,as an educator or parent it is often a challenge to make learning appear fun to your students and kids if traditional methods of learning aren t engaging them it is time to think outside of the box capture their attention with individualized creative and tech based methods of learning,incorporate your students specific interests when you appeal to your students interests it is easier to engage them in the lesson and get them excited about the concepts as an educator take time to ask your students about their hobbies and interests if possible find a way to incorporate these interests into your lesson plans also allow your students to suggest topics and or bring in materials such as books games or apps that they enjoy and want to share with the class as a parent find ways to merge your child s interests with educational content if they are interested in trucks find books and educational games about trucks if they are into music use sheet music to explore fractions 1 x research source structure your students learning time to meet their needs it is irresponsible to assume that all kids learn in the same way and at the same rate as parents and educators evaluate the specific needs of each child determine if they have trouble sitting still examine how they learn best are they auditory learners visual learners or physical learners use this knowledge to structure your lesson plans and at home lessons if they have trouble sitting still give them plenty of breaks to move around if they are visual learners incorporate lots of images into your lessons 2 x research source if you are unsure about your students learning styles try using a quiz or quick assessment to get an idea there are a number of these available for free online if you have the resources you may even consider bringing in a specialist 3 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source provide your students with opportunities to teach each other when children are placed in charge of their own learning or the learning of others they are encouraged to learn the material as thoroughly as possible as an educator provide your students with opportunities to teach each other assign each student a topic and ask them to prepare a lesson on their topic it is now their responsibility to know that topic inside and out once they have prepared a lesson have them present the material to a small group or in front of the class have students work in pairs or small groups instead of asking you for help encourage them to rely on each other to solve any problems they encounter assign them group projects which allow them to engage one another and make learning more fun partner a student that is struggling with a student that has mastered a topic ideally the student that is struggling will ask the other student questions as a parent provide your child with the chance to teach you what they are learning if your child is struggling to solve a problem don t give them the answer instead ask them specific questions about the content such as how do you know ____ or how would you solve ____ 4 x research source get involved in your student s or child s learning when your students or kids are studying or taking part in an educational activity join in if you become an active participant in their education you will model study habits problem solving skills and the feelings of joy one feels when learning something new if they suspect that you do not enjoy the activity or the content they will assume that the activity or content is simply not worth their time spend one on one time with them most children like receiving individual attention because it makes them feel important when you meet a child s desire for affirmation they are more likely to be receptive to the lesson when the kids sit down for quiet reading time take the opportunity to do some reading of your own 5 x research source create hands on learning opportunities children retain information better when their hands and their brains are simultaneously busy or engaged this is accomplished by developing lessons and activities that require students to talk listen and move these types of lessons and activities will benefit active auditory and visual learners incorporate more arts and craft projects into your lessons have students move around to different learning stations group students by interests or strengths provide them with activities that let them explore a topic in a way that engages them 6 x research source take your students on field trips field trips provide students with the opportunity to connect the abstract concepts they are learning inside the classroom to the real world as an educator select field trips that promote hands on learning for example if you are studying your nation s government take them to your state s capitol building as a parent you have the luxury to use your time and resources a little more creatively take your child to an art museum out of state to see their favorite painting or to a distant historic site to experience your nation s history sign your child up for an engineering camp or have them shadow one of your friends at an office 7 x research source allow students to utilize their imaginations instead of limiting or checking their imagination allow their creativity to run rampant foster their creativity by designing lessons that encourage the use of arts and crafts role playing or a range of similar activities when teaching students about the judicial branch have your students hold a mock trial when younger students study historical figures ask them to dress up as their subject for a formal presentation provide your children with the freedom to express themselves through a variety of forms let them choose how they express their learning by giving them multiple options for projects you could for example let them pick between a writing a story drawing a picture or performing a reenactment for a history lesson play educational games after teaching a lesson to your students or studying a concept with your child allow them to play an educational game that will test them on their new knowledge find a relevant educational game through a quick internet search or download an app on your tablet create a review game based on a popular game show or hold a trivia tournament encourage your students or children to play board games or card games 8 x research source make abstract concepts relevant throughout their educational career students are introduced to numerous abstract concepts that seem irrelevant to their lives when you teach a new lesson it is important to explain how the concepts are used by people on a day to day basis to explore mathematical and business principles have the kids set up a store or lemonade stand encourage them to set prices keep track of the inventory and account for the money 9 x research source ask students to find recent news articles or tv clips that relate to what they are learning in school have your students role play conduct a mock trial host a salon and ask each person to come as an important historical figure reenact a famous battle hold a mini model un session assign digital projects today s children are born into a digital age they love technology and are very adept at using it capitalize on their desire to use technology by incorporating it into their assignments instead of writing a journal let them to document their experiences with a digital camera allow students to use computers and tablets to conduct research ask students to build websites create videos or develop a podcast allow kids to listen to required readings 10 x research source utilize technology in your lessons as educators and parents you can make learning more fun by capitalizing on children s love for all things digital in addition to lecturing use digital presentation tools to present your lessons if you are a teacher incorporate brief educational videos into your lectures if you are a parent use brief educational videos to explain concepts your child is struggling to grasp instead of learning a world language allow your kids to learn how to code 11 x research source watch or listen to educational programing as a teacher and parent consider supplementing lectures and traditional readings with educational videos podcasts and plays kids that may appear inattentive during a lecture may be captivated by audio visual materials 12 x research source show and listen to materials that are relevant to what the kids are learning as a reward for completing a great work of literature take your class or child to see the theatrical

how to impart stem education to your children,when it comes to technological innovation the united states remains number one yet among 15 year olds worldwide the us ranks 29th in math literacy falling behind finland croatia the czech republic and liechtenstein 1 x research source this means that the us delivers a less than excellent education in science technology engineering and mathematics stem education due to the declining quality of public primary and secondary education as well as an overall lack of financial and societal support only 10 percent of children s tv characters are scientists or engineers 2 x research source fewer young american students are showing an interest in stem education given that so many us students have shied away from stem studies american industry has been forced to continue its practice of outsourcing overseas this business strategy will not change unless a sufficient number of american students pursue college and graduate degrees in the sciences as of late there has been renewed attention to stem education as well initiatives and funding from the white house on its behalf to contribute to this new momentum parents and caregivers can play a significant role in exciting their children about stem education and its professional possibilities what are the steps in taking this proactive approach this article will help you to get your children more involved in stem education and loving it too font 1 note while this article relates in particular to the us situation the need to boost stem education is similar in many anglo countries and the methods outlined here are of great benefit to children in these countries too,discover your child s natural affinity and academic aptitude every child s constitution is different and even though the theory of neuroplasticity tells us that the human brain can adapt to almost anything some children are able to learn about the sciences more easily than others since it s clear that different forms of knowledge exercise different parts of the brain some students will probably require a little more time and effort than others to learn the same academic subject as a parent or caregiver it is most important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your child support him or her through the process and to try to alleviate unnecessary stress provide an environment that will instill a healthy balance among your child s iq intelligence quotient eq emotional quotient and pq physical and physiological quotient fundamental for your child is the pq a child will not be able to learn if he or she is hungry tired or indisposed eq also plays a very important role in a child s academic success if a child feels emotionally deprived he or she will not be able to learn iq blooms only when pq and eq are supported to be their best teach children about the ways in which science and technology add value to the quality of human lives if children understand all of the wonderful things technology has done and can do for example the cell phone the internet video games cures for diseases for example then they are much more likely to get excited about what they can achieve by pursuing an education in science and technology make sure children can relate to the examples you pick talk about curing illnesses rather than relating technological progress to something like cancer stem cell research young children will not understand highly technical language if you can base your discussion of scientific progress in a story about someone or something a child is already familiar with such as a family member or friend who has been ill your message will be much more effective create a science and technology environment outside of school this can be accomplished in many ways view science and technology tv channels with your child engage in discussions about what you viewed afterward try an experiment that you saw demonstrated on tv or in a video part of the fun can be gathering the items needed to perform it as well as setting up the experimental lab conduct internet searches on performing fun experiments there are many sites dedicated to science projects for kids make home experiments fun occasions organize groups of kids to participate at your home in your backyard garage or another safe place join or organize science and technology s t related groups on social networks like facebook and linkedin in order to brainstorm with other parents and caregivers you might even be in contact with teachers in s t through these online communities find or start a supplementary school like the saturday math school in a boston suburb established by russian immigrants 3 x research source become a member of the local science museum and keep a watch on activities for kids incorporate regular visits into your family s activities use building blocks puzzles and games for family activities leave these in obvious places so that kids pick them up play with them and view them as part of their everyday surroundings most importantly engage in conversation about science related topics with children in way that pertains to everyday life experiences bring science and technology closer to life by pointing out its daily applications help children understand how science and technology have led to such things as running water electricity and cars create a before and after scenario in order for your child to realize that people did not always have running water electricity or cars by explaining the history of technology your child will begin to comprehend that technology is related to progress and serves a very important purpose in day to day living on a regular basis conduct a task analysis in relation to metacognition standards this way you can help teachers correctly evaluate the cognitive abilities of your child and match the mode of instruction to his or her skill level explain that science and technology can lead to fame and monetary gain appeal to children s fantasies and tempt them provide examples of great scientists and achievers you can easily find examples by conducting an online search consider making a home project out of researching the lives of famous scientists and innovators show your child how to find age appropriate resources on the web or in books and magazines to find interesting facts have him or her report back with findings work with your child to create a poster powerpoint video or interactive presentation why not use technological media to display knowledge about science and technology teach critical inquiry skills to your child in the early stages of his or her life start by demonstrating how to observe ask questions create hypotheses and test those hypotheses inquiry is the basis of science math and technological activity when one is interested in how something works inquires into it and then makes discoveries the desire to learn more ignites curiosity leading to inquiry provides the best foundation for perpetual self improvement through study and experimentation encourage children to ask questions try not to brush aside their queries even if they don t make sense or are not good questions turn the bad question into an interesting and relevant question and then engage in discussion you don t necessarily need to know all of the answers an important part of the process is helping your children learn how to find answers themselves through your guidance,Education-and-Communications

how to make an open educational resource,open educational resource oer is something for teaching or learning from that has been created to share freely online it could be a lesson a quiz a whole project or anything else that helps stimulate learning or inspire teaching getting started on making an oer can feel like a daunting task but it needn t feel this way reusable simple and desirable oer can be produced in just a few hours based on your existing knowledge and know how the suggested approach here provides a foundation for a small oer approximately 4 hours of activities but is designed to scale the longer you allow it to develop and the more ingredients you put in the bigger the resource can become,crack open your idea and mix in the creativity you ll be coming to this development with an idea it could be anything take that idea and flip it on its head think to yourself this idea would never work as an x then challenge yourself and make it work or take a random idea generator examples are explored below in part 3 the step commencing with immerse yourself think whether your activity could be inspired by something in that resource alternatively look around you and find a random item e g a spoon and apply it to the learning activity you have in mind e g cultural analysis and comparison through the use of a culture s cutlery or poetry about common objects displayed in their shape to make interesting art works choose a suitable platform when making an oer you need to think not only about the suitability of the delivery platform for the initial intended content use but also its suitability for future re use delivery needs to be open freely accessible no password protection and ideally editable at the very least able to be copied you do not need to always make a new website you could develop and upload a text based document create a bank of new images in an existing space edit an existing space like a wiki create a closed resource but share how you made it openly through social media or you could develop a new webpage these are just a few examples give yourself plenty of time good learning resources often take a lot of time to develop through reflection and sourcing content this is especially true with oers as finding open content or authoring your own images and text etc can take a lot of time that said it s well worth the effort often you will find yourself stumbling upon something new and unexpected through your development journey in turn this may inspire you to decide to completely change what you initially had in mind no worries just run with it the time you had spent up to then was not wasted it helped you achieve your new and exciting plan do not fear the not yet tried things can seem scary then you put flowers in it be prepared to take risks and try something new you have nothing to lose but a lot to gain from giving a new idea a go immerse yourself learning resources are everywhere and so are ideas for new ones jump in at the deep end and fully immerse yourself in different spaces and resources for inspiration and potentially sourcing content check out the following ideas blogs mailing lists stumble upon websites moocs oer and cc content banks and search engines online articles social media etc often the first jump is the hardest then it s a lot of fun recycle repurpose reuse do not feel like you have to make everything from scratch there are loads of great ideas and resources out there available for use in a new context it is important to note that content can be used in various ways if forming part of the core activity open access content can be pulled out and reused directly partially or simply be inspiring there is also the opportunity to use or sign post to other non cc content providing you have obtained the author s direct permission to use it in this context and there is no harm in asking however should the content be supplementary to the core activity for example you might also like to look at this link the sign posted content is not necessarily required to hold a cc license too however should high volumes of traffic be expected such as for use in a mooc it is polite and thoughtful to give the author a heads up as it could be sitting on a personally hosted server be careful what you open not everything on the internet is an open resource just because it appears open does not mean there is an open license to use it this is particularly true for images where the image may be found in multiple places with different licenses available it is important to try to find the original image or at least show that you made every effort to find it rather than simply choosing the version with the most open attribution if in doubt try a different image start from a position of open using creative commons search engines to source images where you do not hold the license personally makes the development of open content easier although do double check the licenses just to be sure keep an eye on the particular license of the content for example share alike which stipulates you must use the exact same license for the final work the resource is incorporated into more information available in the video remember attribution attribution attribution if someone has taken the time to create a n open resource acknowledge their effort through attribution even if it is not a requirement of the license it is a good habit to develop and a nice way to say thank you it also makes it easier for others to use the resource after you assemble the layers of your oer so you ve immersed yourself in exciting resources you ve been inspired you have a list of content to use now all you ve go to do is link it back to your vision for the learning activity applying all the steps and insight previously gained again leave yourself plenty of time set your newly created oer free and open don t forget to apply an open license to what you produce creativecommons org helps you build a suitable cc license for your content which can be embedded into your resource in lots of different forms displaying an open license badge signifies to other users that your content is part of a growing community of open practice and resources lovely,Education-and-Communications

how to stop backpack straps from slipping,in addition to being an annoyance having backpack straps that keep slipping off your shoulders can lead to shoulder neck or back pain in many cases the culprit is an improperly fitted school or outdoors backpack which can be solved by choosing the right size of pack and cinching up the straps properly alternatively you may be able to troubleshoot the problem by making quick fixes to the straps buckles or shoulder pads,tighten the shoulder straps by pulling on the loose ends with the backpack on grab the loose ends of the shoulder straps that come out of the adjustment buckles located a little below your armpits pull firmly and evenly on each strap so that the backpack pulls up against your back snugly but not uncomfortably tightly the pack should end up somewhere between your shoulder blades and hips 1 x research source don t over tighten the straps you should be able to slip your hand between each strap and your underarm if you ve tightened the straps as far as they ll go and the pack is still sagging down so far that it touches your backside the backpack is almost certainly too large for you cut how much you carry to less than 10 15 of your body weight if your backpack is too heavy the straps may slip off of your shoulders more easily even worse the heavy pack may cause back pain neck pain or bruising where the straps press against your shoulders 2 x research source kids should not carry a backpack that weighs more than 10 of their body weight for instance a 75 lb 34 kg child should not carry a pack that weighs more than 7 5 lb 3 4 kg adults should also stick to the 10 threshold whenever possible with 15 as the safe maximum connect the shoulder straps across your chest with a sternum strap most outdoors backpacks already have sternum straps but they re less common on school backpacks connecting the shoulder straps with a sternum strap across your upper chest makes slippage nearly impossible so consider adding them to your pack 3 x research source look online for backpack sternum straps they usually are made of the same kind of material as shoulder straps and often have the same type of snap together buckle to hold them together whether you have a built in or added on sternum strap proper placement is important the buckled strap should rest high on your chest about 1 in 2 5 cm below your collarbone tie or tape the shoulder straps if the buckles keep slipping backpack shoulder straps typically loop through plastic buckles that make the straps adjustable in length if these buckles fail to hold properly the straps will loosen up and slide off your shoulder while you wear the pack replacing the buckles is one possibility but there are quicker alternatives as well 4 x research source one option is to use the free end of the strap below each buckle to tie a simple knot like the first part of tying your shoe up against the bottom of each buckle or wrap a sturdy tape like duct tape or electrical tape several times around both the free and attached sections of strap right below each buckle replace or add to the backpack s current shoulder pads while the main job of the shoulder straps pads is to prevent the straps from digging into your shoulders they also help to prevent slippage straps with a grippier texture on the underside do a better job of keeping the straps in place search online for backpack shoulder pads if your backpack has built in shoulder pads that aren t removable you can still probably slip another set of pads over top of them they often attach with snaps or hook and loop velcro closures replace low quality buckles that simply won t hold the straps some backpack buckles are poorly made and are too smooth to effectively grip the straps in place even higher quality buckles may smooth out due to wear and tear and lose their grip over time if this happens replacing the buckles may be the best solution to your problem 5 x research source strap buckles come in different shapes sizes and styles your best bet is to bring the backpack with you to a retailer that specializes in camping and hiking gear a store associate can help you find the right buckles for your needs choose a outdoors backpack based on your torso length grab a flexible cloth tape measure and have a friend hold it to your spine making sure it follows the contours of your back have them record the measurement between the base of your neck the c7 vertebra and the vertebra that s even with the tops of your hip bones 6 x research source bring this measurement with you to an outdoors store or use it to shop online if your measurement is shorter than 16 in 41 cm for instance you may need an extra small pack while you may need a large pack if it s longer than 20 in 51 cm put on the loaded pack without tightening any of the straps load up the backpack with the gear you plan to put in it when using it placing heavier items in first so they rest closest to your back if the waist belt or sternum strap are buckled undo them so you can slip the pack over your shoulders 7 x research source outdoors backpacks are made to carry a lot of gear but the loaded pack shouldn t weigh more than 10 for kids or 10 15 for adults of your body weight for example a 150 lb 68 kg adult shouldn t carry a backpack that weighs more than 15 22 5 lb 6 8 10 2 kg clip and tighten the waist belt so it s at the top of your hips snap together the buckle on the waist belt that runs between the bottoms of the shoulder straps pull on the loose end of the strap until the belt is snug but not uncomfortably tight against your hips and abdomen 8 x research source the waist belt should go right over the tops of your hip bones called the iliac crest if it s above or below this point adjust the positioning of the belt and or backpack once secured the waist belt should carry the majority of the backpack s weight this way the larger muscles and bones in your legs do most of the work tighten the shoulder straps and load lifters to secure the pack pull on the loose strap ends coming from the shoulder strap buckles positioned to the sides of your chest snug them up until the backpack generally conforms to the shape of your spine but don t make them so tight that they re uncomfortable then pull the loose straps for the load lifters which are located above your collarbone 9 x research source cinching up the load lifters brings the top of the pack closer to your upper back as with the shoulder straps tighten them until you have a snug but not uncomfortable fit secure the sternum strap and test the pack s fit clip together the buckle on the sternum strap then adjust the positioning of the strap if needed so that it runs between the shoulder straps about 1 in 2 5 cm below your collarbone pull on the loose end of the strap until you have a snug but not uncomfortable fit 10 x research source at this point the backpack should feel comfortable and secure with most of its weight distributed to your legs take a short walk around with the pack on your back if the pack feels uncomfortable or if the straps feel like they re slipping fine tune the buckle tightness until you get the right fit buy a backpack that s suited to your age and size while hiking and camping backpacks are sized based on your torso length school backpacks usually come in more general size categories like small medium and large or youth teen and adult use these categories for guidance but base your purchase on the age and especially size of the wearer 11 x research source if the backpack is for you or the intended wearer is with you hold the pack up to your or their chest it should fit between the bottom of your collarbone and the top of your hips the straps on a pack that is too large may not cinch up enough to keep them in place resulting in strap slippage load heavy items in the pack first but don t overload it fill the pack with the typical materials you ll be carrying like books and a lunch bag for comfort and safety place heavier materials in the pack first so that they re closest to your back when the pack is on 12 x research source a loaded backpack should weigh no more than 10 of the body weight of a child or 10 15 of the body weight of an adult in other words a 50 lb 23 kg kid shouldn t carry a pack that weighs more than 5 lb 2 3 kg slip the loaded pack over your shoulders with the straps loosened the straps on a newly bought backpack are usually pretty loose so just leave them that way for the moment if the straps are already uncomfortably tight loosen them by lifting up on the side of each shoulder strap buckle where the loose end of the strap exits it 13 x research source feed some of the excess strap back into each buckle if they don t loosen up on their own pull the shoulder straps tight so the pack snugs to your back grab the loose ends of the shoulder straps one in each hand and pull firmly cinch up the straps until the pack slides up against your back between your shoulder blades and the tops of your hips there should be very little slack in the straps but you should still be able to fit your hand between the strap and your underarm 14 x research source the backpack shouldn t be touching your butt if it is the backpack is either too big or too heavy for you or you need to cinch up the straps some

how to choose between private and public school,choosing whether to send your children to a public or private school can be a very hard decision to make knowing what matters to you in terms of your child s educational experience the differences between public and private education and taking some practical action to explore possible schools can make the process a little easier,determine which subjects are important to you when you re weighing the difference between public and private school curriculum is a good place to start almost all public schools follow the same curriculum because they re bound by federal law but private schools are not public schools tend to emphasize core subjects like math science english and social studies this well rounded education is good preparation for your child s college career private schools are not bound by the same curriculum requirements that public schools are so they may emphasize different subjects or specialize in a particular type of curriculum like the arts 1 x research source determine what accommodations if any your child needs if your child has a learning or physical disability knowing what accommodations or help your child requires to succeed in the classroom can help you decide on a school private or public all schools that receive government funding are required to abide by the americans with disability act whether they are private or public private schools run by religious institutions are not subject to the ada but some states have passed laws that regulate those schools in other ways although private schools can have admission requirements they cannot refuse a student based solely on a disability private schools also must amend any policies or procedures that deny access to students with disabilities decide how important diversity of student body is to you when deciding what matters to you about the school your child attends you might want to consider the diversity of the student population do you want a school that reflects your child s own background or one with more diversity most studies show that private schools are more accepting of a diverse student body and tend to mount more stringent anti bullying campaigns however while private schools are more accepting of a diverse student body public schools tend to actually have more diversity among their students 2 x research source decide if you want co ed or single gender education whether you send your child to a single gender or co educational school is a personal decision but make sure you know the pros and cons of both types of education before you choose a school some studies show that girls do better in single gender educational settings particularly in math and science courses because they are free from the gender stereotyping that might convince them that boys are better at those subjects however some studies show that co ed classrooms and schools more adequately prepare students for life after school the world is after all co ed additionally there isn t a lot of research to support the idea that single gender schools always result in higher test scores or less gender stereotyping 3 x research source take into account teacher quality because public and private schools are governed by different federals laws and regulations the quality of teachers can vary knowing how important teacher quality is to you and your child can help you weigh the difference between public and private schools public schools are required by law to employ certified teachers this means that every teacher your child has will have a teaching certificate private schools are not required to employ certified teachers this can be great for your student if for example their history teacher has a phd in history but no teaching certificate but depending on the school the teachers might not be as good as those you would find in some public schools 4 x research source because private schools are not required to accept students with special needs although some do they might not have a special education teacher on staff 5 x research source keep in mind that this is a very general view on public vs private school teachers there are fantastic and not so great teachers in both systems ask about testing scores although you shouldn t put too much stock in a school s online ratings you should still ask about individual schools testing scores students at private schools tend to outscore public school students on standardized tests which can affect your child s ability to get into college however there is some debate about this general assessment researchers have used the same data to come to conflicting conclusions and other factors like socioeconomic status can influence of student s scores regardless of where they are educated 6 x research source decide how important extra curricular activities are to you and your child the number of extra curricular activities including sports offered by public and private schools can vary greatly knowing how important a variety of activities and sports is to you can help when assessing the differences between schools public schools tend to have a greater variety of activities clubs and sports teams than private schools because they get a certain amount of funding for this public schools are also required to abide by title ix which requires equity in activity and sport funding so whether you have a son or daughter they ll have a good chance of having a number of teams to choose from for tryouts 7 x research source private schools will sometimes offer sports and activities that public schools don t which is important if the sport your child plays is not very common in public schools take into account class size in general public schools tend to have larger class sizes than private schools if you need a school that can give more attention to individual students you might consider a private school or a smaller public school 8 x research source make a list before you start searching for schools make a list of the things you re looking for in a school this list will help you keep your priorities front and center as you choose a school find out what district you re in the most basic place to start when choosing a school is knowing which district you live in this will greatly narrow down the schools you can choose from for your child some school districts have what s called school of choice which means your child can choose which school in the district to attend regardless of its geographic proximity to your home other districts have agreements with neighboring districts that let you choose a school outside of the district you live in find out if your district allows either of these options if they don t your student will attend the public school associated with your neighborhood 9 x research source decide how far you re willing to drive if you decide ahead of time that you re not willing to drive more than 20 minutes to take your children to school you can narrow down your search for a new school public or private right away work out a budget before you even begin to choose between public or private you ll need to know how much money you can spend on your child s education public schools are taxpayer funded so you won t pay tuition at a public school private schools are privately funded and the main way they raise that money is through charging tuition working out how much you have to spend on your child s education can really help you when you make your decision 10 x research source decide if your child needs a specialized program your child might need a program that specializes in teaching students with certain disabilities or one that focuses on a particular area of their education like an art school knowing what sort of program your child needs can help narrow down the list too 11 x research source find out how much tuition you ll pay tuition rates at private schools vary widely from state to state from 3 600 to over 20 000 per year make sure you know what the average is in your state before you begin looking private school review is a website that can be helpful in finding this information for your state 12 x research source you might not necessarily have to pay full tuition for a private school if your child gets a scholarship some private schools offer internal scholarships and there are a variety of national scholarships that are awarded based on everything from religious affiliation to socio economic status some states also offer vouchers to defray the cost of private education you ll need to find out whether your state does so and how to apply for them again private school review can direct you to that information 13 x research source talk to other parents before you decide on which public school you ll send your child to talk to other parents and ask for their honest opinion about the school most parents will be honest about their and their child s experiences if you don t know anyone who currently attends the school you can ask for contact information for the school s parent teacher association pta 14 x research source talk to the principal consider chatting with the principal of the school you re interested in for your child the principals are in charge of the school and you can get a good idea of how the school runs and what they prioritize by talking to the person in charge 15 x research source ask how tuition is spent it s easy to assume that higher tuition rates mean a better education when it comes to private schools be sure you find out how the tuition money you pay is allocated does it get spent on the buildings or on your child s education a clean inviting cheerful learning environment is important but you child probably doesn t need to study somewhere that looks like a castle to get a good education 16 x research source meet the school s faculty because teacher quality can vary so much from school to school ask to meet some of the faculty at the schools you re considering this can give you a much better idea of the general quality of the school s faculty than just reading online bios or cvs can give you tour the school schedule a tour of the private schools you re interested in you can learn a lot from these tours do the students look happy and engaged are the learning spaces bright and clean you can learn a lot about a school based on your gut reaction when you visit taking your children along gives them the chance to see the school and decide if it feels like a comfortable environment to them don t put too much stock in online ratings schools in lower income neighborhoods might have a lower rating on online rating websites but they could also have fantastic teachers and principals talking to other parents will help you figure out if this is true so don t write a school off just because its ratings are a little low 17 x research source,Education-and-Communications
how to accomplish a school goal,setting goals can help you stay on top of your studies and earn good grades but it s important to set the right kinds of goals setting unrealistic goals could set you up for disappointment and frustration while setting goals that are too easy will not challenge you to your full potential that s where s m a r t specific measurable action oriented realistic time bound goals can help learning how to create and work towards attainable goals can help you succeed in school and in life,determine what type of goal you want to set there are many possible goals you could set but the type of goal refers to how you ll measure your progress and success the two main types are process goals and outcome goals process goals focus on the work that you ll do within a given time period an example of a process goal would be to complete and submit all of your assignments on time this week outcome goals focus on the results of your work an example of an outcome goal would be to earn a grade of at least 90 on your next test identify the reasons why your goal is important having a goal may not be enough to keep you motivated if that s the case it may be important to remind yourself of why that goal is meaningful to you and why you hope to achieve it reflecting on the outcome of that goal both the positive results if you succeed and the negative results if you don t may help you stay more focused and driven over time 1 x research source do you need to do well in a class to pass are you trying to improve your grades overall perhaps you want to do well in a class so that you can eventually seek employment in a related field if this is the case you ll want to learn as much as possible in that class set up a reward system to stay motivated some people work best when they know there is some type of reward to be had having a self imposed reward system helps you stay motivated and track your progress so you ll know whether or not you deserve your treat for the day week month or semester 2 x research source consider setting incremental rewards set smaller rewards for minor mile markers and bigger rewards for accomplishing the hardest parts of your goal imagine climbing a set of stairs each stair is a mini goal that essentially leads you to the main goal at the top decide on some type of reinforcer that will help you stay motivated it can be a favorite snack an event you want to go to a physical object you d like to buy or even a vacation or time off from your normal schedule use that reward to motivate you agree in advance that you won t get to enjoy your reward unless you accomplish your goal 3 x expert source alexander ruiz m ed educational consultant expert interview 25 june 2020 consider asking a close friend to either help you stay motivated or prevent you from indulging in your reward without success make your goal as specific as possible having a vaguely defined goal can make it difficult to follow through on your efforts and track your progress however having a clear well defined goal will help you stay driven and know how far you ve come 4 x research source your goal should be as clear and actionable as possible remember to focus on either a process goal or an outcome goal keep in mind though that you can work toward multiple goals at once for instance you might have an outcome goal of getting an a in english and process goals along the way that help you earn that a for example instead of just saying your goal is to get through your math class figure out what you hope to accomplish do you want to become more proficient in math a process goal or earn a good grade an outcome goal ensure that your progress is measurable whenever you set a goal for yourself it s important to recognize how you ve progressed in working towards it that s why you should always set goals with clear measurable progress marks and keep track of your efforts every step of the way 5 x research source determine in advance how you will measure success ask yourself how will i know when i ve accomplished my goal you can mark off successes when you reach checkpoints along the way you can even use a reward system choose both short term and long term measures of success for example you might measure success in the short term by looking at how much studying and homework you get done in a week and in the long term by watching how your grades improve over the course of the semester decide on action oriented steps to accomplish your goal even a good well defined goal could be difficult to achieve without a clear action plan when you set your goal make sure you include action oriented steps as part of your goal development that way you ll know what you re trying to accomplish and more importantly how you ll get there 6 x research source be very clear in how you intend to achieve your goal having action oriented steps means developing clear guidelines that lay out what specifically you will need to do at every step along the way think about the steps your goal will require both in the short term and in the long term focus on what specifically you will need to do for example action oriented steps might include completing your homework ahead of time reviewing your notes every day after class and arranging a meeting with your instructor make sure your goal is realistic it s important to dream big but it s also important to know what you can realistically accomplish with the materials you currently possess and the time frame you re given don t bite off more than you can chew but at the same time don t give yourself a task that s too easy 7 x research source an example of a realistic goal would be to improve your course grade by one letter before the end of the semester an unrealistic goal by comparison would be to turn an f into an a by the end of the semester be aware of what could potentially hinder your success and plan accordingly so that these obstacles do not impede your progress towards accomplishing your goal for instance if your goal is to get a good grade on an essay you ll want to be aware of other assignments that could affect the amount of time you spend working on the essay give yourself a reasonable time frame if you re working within a school calendar the end of that semester might be the end of your time frame however there s still plenty of flexibility in terms of what can be done and when it needs to be done by 8 x research source decide in advance when your goal needs to be accomplished once you have a firm deadline work your way backwards to determine when you need to begin your work and when various milestones along the way must be met for example if you re working within the time frame of a semester you might decide that you ll accomplish your goal before finals week that means working backwards to figure out what needs to be completed and when be aware of your deadlines a well planned smart goal is meaningless if you don t keep track of your deadlines and do the necessary work along the way you ll need to put in a lot of effort if you hope to accomplish that goal but with proper planning you should be able to balance that work very comfortably 9 x research source if you have a longer timeframe be sure to schedule checkpoints along the way if you want to improve your grade find out how to monitor your progress such as by paying attention to progress reports and assignment grades schedule your work time and your deadline on your calendar get into the habit of setting aside work and study time each day and sticking to your routine remove distractions or remove yourself from distracting situations if you can t work at home or in your dorm room due to distractions there study in the library and keep your phone turned off let your friends know that you may not be available as much for social events while you work to meet your deadlines you ll need to avoid temptation by simply avoiding those social events altogether that would interrupt your studies make sure you give yourself enough time before each important deadline to get the necessary work done you ll still have the same amount of work to do if you procrastinate but you ll have less time and more stress if you put it off until finishing is not just important but also urgent 10 x expert source alexander ruiz m ed educational consultant expert interview 25 june 2020 identify any potential obstacles even the best of plans are susceptible to pitfalls along the way most of the potential obstacles you ll face are likely of your own creation but by being aware of them in advance you can reduce the risk of failure 11 x research source some common obstacles to school success include conflicting deadlines extracurricular activities spending too much time with friends and distractions like tv the internet and video games set limits for yourself it s okay to spend some time doing fun things but you have to balance work and play time for example you might decide that you ll allow yourself 30 minutes of video games or an hour with friends but only after two hours of studying once you ve identified the potential obstacles to your success you can work around them accordingly on your own schedule triage your work sometimes it makes the most sense to start your work where it s easiest however if you re worried about budgeting your time you may find it helpful to focus on the most difficult or time consuming tasks first rather than saving them for last alternatively you might want to get easier assignments out of the way first in order to reduce your stress just make sure to allot enough time to finish the more demanding tasks 12 x research source the difficult parts of an assignment may require additional periodicals assistance from an instructor and other resources that could be difficult to attain on short notice in addition to doing the difficult work up front you should also be aware of any assignments that build off of other assignments these may require you to complete other work before moving on to that assignment remember that the more time you give yourself the easier it will be to get your most difficult work done on time find support from friends family and teachers having support can make a huge difference in your success rate not only will the people in your support network help you stay motivated they can also celebrate with you once you ve accomplished your goal 13 x research source once you ve identified people who can help support you along the way let those individuals know what you need from them some people might be better at offering kind words of encouragement while others may be good at getting you to stay focused or getting you back to work when

how to teach children liberal values,a liberal person believes that the government should take action to help improve the lives of its citizens 1 x research source although you may have your own specific opinions about certain politicized topics if you want your children to learn values that are typically liberal take time to understand the stance of liberal people on political issues learn how you can help children understand and decide what makes sense for them,teach body autonomy it is important that your children understand that they are in control of their bodies and they don t have to hug kiss touch or be touched if they don t want to 2 x research source liberals believe that people should have control over what happens to their bodies whether they are a man or a woman or whether they are young or old don t tell your children whom they have to show affection to for example don t say kiss grandma before she goes home instead let them decide how they feel comfortable saying goodbye to grandma conversely it is also important to teach your children that they need to ask permission before touching anyone else encourage them to ask grandma if they can give her a kiss when they have said that they would like to do so avoid policing your child s gender expression don t reinforce the gender stereotyping that leads boys to believe that they shouldn t show emotions and girls to believe that they have to be dainty and wear dresses all of the time instead let them find out who they are and what they like without injecting your own biases into the situation 3 x research source for example let your daughters engage in physical activity and let them do it the same way that boys do if that s what they want don t discourage them from climbing on the monkey bars because you re worried they re too fragile conversely don t discourage a boy from liking something because it s pink and don t say things like big boys don t cry when he feels sad about something teach empathy for others being empathetic about the experiences of others plays a big role in liberal ideology your child will need to develop their own skills of empathy and research suggests that parents can play a big role in helping develop this skill 4 x research source for example research suggests that children who feel secure and loved are more likely to be empathetic spend time talking with your child about different emotions and about how emotions can affect our behavior it doesn t matter how young your child is talking to them about their own feelings as well as your own will help them understand that everyone has different experiences set a good example for your children being empathetic yourself is a great way to teach children about empathy if you and your child witness someone who is going through a hard time e g a homeless person on the street talk with your child and ask them how they think that person must be feeling expose them to different types of people help your children see that people can be quite different when you venture outside your own group of friends expose your children to the different cultures and experiences that the world has to offer for example you could take them on a trip to a foreign country while you are visiting that country ask them to identify what is different about the local people however also ask them to notice how they are similar to those people teach you children to be tolerant one of the core values of liberalism is tolerance 5 x research source it is important to teach kids that being tolerant doesn t mean sacrificing their own beliefs it means that children should learn that it is good to be open to learning about the uniqueness of others 6 x research source this applies to more than merely political values it also refers to cultural and religious differences as well as the other ways in which people can be different explain the need for social support programs many liberals believe that it is important that the government fund programs that help people in need this could involve a range of different programs for example if you are fired from your job in the u s you are able to get unemployment benefits that will help you take care of your family while you search for a new job you can demonstrate why this is important by pointing out ways that you or someone you know has been helped through a tough situation by a social support program you can use an example like this last year aunt sarah was fired from her job and she was very worried for awhile about how she could take care of her family without a paycheck however she was able to get money from the government to help feed her family while she looked for a new job you can demonstrate the value of social support programs by asking a child what they think should be done in a particular situation for example if you see a homeless person asking for money on the street ask your children how they would help that person compare their response to something the government might do be in favor of peaceful resolutions liberal people tend to be against war as a means of solving problems war results in unnecessary loss of life pain and suffering and money being spent on the military that could have been spent on other things such as education one good way to talk about this topic with your kids is to ask them about how they have been taught to solve problems with friends at school emphasize that violence is never an appropriate means for solving problems point out that many governments resort to violence when trying to solve problems but in the end leave many families feeling sad because they have lost someone they care about support immigration american liberals are generally in favor of immigration laws that make it possible for people to immigrate legally to the united states additionally liberals are typically in favor of extending help to undocumented immigrants who wish to stay in the united states you can talk with your children about your own family history unless you are a native american your ancestors immigrated to the us from somewhere else point out how many families would like to come to the us to have good lives just like your children have support women s rights perhaps one of the biggest debates in politics these days is the issue of pro choice vs pro life typically people with liberal values tend to support the pro choice side of the argument this is the notion that a woman has the right to choose what she does with her body and if she wants to have an abortion that is exclusively her decision similarly be in favor of offering women several methods of birth control taking a pro choice stance doesn t necessarily mean you think women should get an abortion whenever they feel like it it does mean however that you support giving women and men lots of different ways to prevent unwanted pregnancy this may be a difficult topic to discuss with your child directly but you can demonstrate that every one should have the right to choose what to do with their body for example you can remind your child that they don t have to touch or kiss anyone if they don t feel like it point out that everyone has this right no matter their gender recognize that marriage is something everyone is entitled to another hot debate in the united states in recent years is gay marriage liberals tend to support marriage for all people whether they are heterosexual or homosexual the point is that love is love and people should have the right to choose whom they marry as long as it is with another consenting adult talk with your kids about sexuality you can explain to them that just because they are a girl doesn t mean they have to like boys and vice versa explain how there are many boys who like boys and girls who like girls and some who like both boys and girls ask your children what they think about gay marriage and why they think what they think ask them if they believe that a person should be allowed to marry the person they love regardless of their gender as long as the other person also wants to get married showing your child that you are open to conversations and questions on any topic will make them more open to discussing topics that they find difficult be clear with yourself and your partner about what you want to teach there are likely many values that you want to instill in your child think about which values are the most important to you it is important to realize that you have only so much influence on your children focus on the values that mean the most to you 7 x research source for example you may feel very strongly about raising children who are tolerant and open minded but you may not care too much about what religion they follow if they follow any religion at all you can talk with your children about religion but don t make it the most important thing instead focus on setting examples of tolerance talk about what can happen when people are narrow minded and intolerant in one study liberal parents reported that teaching tolerance was of primary importance 8 x research source if you have a partner with whom you are raising a child spend time talking with your partner about what values you want to instill this could be challenging if the two of you have differing political views try to find a middle ground or at least a few areas you can agree on don t force your values on your children there is research that suggests that if you constantly push your beliefs onto your children there will be a tendency for them to rebel 9 x research source if you consider yourself liberal and want to raise liberal children don t force them to accept that position as though it is the only right way to live this doesn t mean you can t talk to them about your political beliefs and why you hold them instead it means that you should avoid being dogmatic about your beliefs and try to avoid saying negative things about conservatives in front of your children explain both sides of the story and talk about why you feel liberal values are best for you ask them their opinions about things without first telling them what you think learn about who they are and how they feel without applying pressure they might come to resent answer questions with patience your child may come to you with lots of difficult questions about why you believe what you believe and they may even ask questions that challenge your beliefs do your best to avoid losing patience and getting angry 10 x research source for example your child may come home from a sleepover and tell you that jimmy s dad told jimmy s mom that anyone who believes gay marriage is acceptable is an idiot your child may ask you why that is in a situation like this you may feel very angry that jimmy s dad was saying this in front of your child instead of getting angry however say something like well jimmy s dad might think that is true and he is entitled to believe that but gay people are entitled to love whom they love and marry the person who wants to marry them do you think that people should be able to marry the person they love or that they shouldn t be allowed to because someone else doesn t like it presenting your response as a conversation in which you explain your own beliefs as logically as possible helps your child to make the idea their own and decide what makes sense to them answer questions honestly both sides of the political spectrum have their faults and being liberal doesn t make you perfect when your child asks you a question give an honest answer talk about both sides of the issue and why you have chosen to believe what you do 11 x research source for example many people start out somewhere on the political spectrum and then move to the other side for some reason talk to your children about your early views and why you eventually became a more liberal person give examples of events that led you to believe in more liberal values keep in mind that when it comes to values there is not usually an objectively correct answer there is only a belief in a morally correct answer keeping this in mind will help you avoid being dogmatic avoid speaking hatefully about those with whom you disagree if you are a very political person you might have strong opinions about those with other points of view you may think conservatives are nothing more than racist bigots however one important value of liberals is tolerance thus you should set an example for children be tolerant of those who don t agree with you you can explain to children why you don t agree with conservative values but do so respectfully without using hateful or derogatory language set a good example the best way to help instill liberal values is to set a good example for your children by living in accordance with those values whenever possible set a good example of what you think it means to be a liberal person 12 x research source for example be tolerant of people who are different from you don t criticize someone just because they disagree with you try volunteering for a political movement that you support and bring your kids along opt for peaceful movements where your child will be able to see liberal people at their best avoid movements that are violent as this may frighten your child talk about why politics is important for most children politics is a confusing subject take time to explain why it is important to have an opinion about politics 13 x research source for example explain to them the two main parties in the us democratic and republican as well as some of the other parties e g green party tea party libertarians etc talk about the values of these parties and give some examples of members of each party explain how in the us everyone over the age of 18 is entitled to vote in elections that will help decide who will run the country explain how elected leaders are supposed to represent the will of the people who elected them reinforce your ideas through social interactions with like minded people have your children spend time with friends and family who have similar values hearing about why other people have similar beliefs will help children decide on their own beliefs this doesn t mean that you should keep them away from people who have different values as they grow older children will have to learn to deal with the fact that people are different since tolerance is a liberal value showing them that there are people who think differently is important if they spend time with someone who has strong conservative values address the matter with your child for example you can say today you are going to spend time with grandpa grandpa is a good and kind man but sometimes he might say something that you don t think is right try to remember that even though he has some different ideas about things he loves you very much and you love him too we don t have to agree on everything to be a close family,Education-and-Communications
how to mentor a teenager,all teenagers experience troubled times some more serious than others even though they might not show it or even know it all they sometimes really need is someone to listen to them and guide them in the right direction mentoring teenagers isn t always as hard as it seems but at the same time not everyone is up for it and it takes serious dedication with the right morals attitudes and experience you could potentially combat some problematic teenage personalities and provide guidance and advice in order to motivate them and help them feel better about themselves and succeed the way that they want to,really think about why you want to be a mentor before you actually take it on realise that some teenagers are easier to work with but others will be a handful at first or even from time to time you really need to be clear with yourself on whether you have the time patience mentality and maturity in order to mentor a teenage because you never know what their situation may be evaluate the reasons why you want to be a mentor and be honest with yourself on whether they are good enough reasons or not you might for example feel motivated to help out teenagers with their education if you particularly struggled with education but managed to overcome that struggle talk to mentors who have experience with teenage mentees you can talk to people that have previously mentored teenagers or even currently mentor teenagers ask them questions about how they find found the job and how they handle handled different situations so that you have a better understanding avoid asking them questions based on hearsay that not only relates to but also identifies an individual i e i heard that kid john was insert problem here what exactly was his situation and how did you deal with it even if they aren t reluctant to discuss it with you unless john himself is present and doesn t mind talking about the benefits of mentoring to you it s best to respect the confidentiality aspect of the mentoring process a more appropriate question would have just been what was your experience with insert issue here and how did you deal with it those questions were much better to ask because they don t refer to a particular person and don t suggest that an individual s name has to be mentioned either but if the mentor does mention names make a good start and keep it to yourself talk to mentees about their mentoring experiences this means that you can talk to people who were mentored as teenagers or even teenagers that are currently being mentored once again ask them questions about what they found helpful and what helped them feel comfortable about talking to their mentors think about questions that you could ask beforehand that could help you get an idea on whether you may be capable of becoming a mentor for a teenager or not arrange some form of schedule of appointments in which you will see your mentee s and make sure that you re keeping to said schedule this means making sure that you and your mentee are seeing each other when and where you both plan on seeing each other and also making sure that the time is spent efficiently by giving them the opportunity to talk about what s going on for them and any problems that they may have if you re mentee isn t turning up then you should find out what s really going on they might not be turning up because something is happening you will need to be seen as a reliable person so make sure that you turn up too and show them that extra mile of respect too by being punctual build up trust with your mentee this is a two way thing not only do you have to trusted by your mentee but you will need to trust them too you can start off by making sure that you re at least on friendly terms with each other you can achieve this by for example contacting each other every now and then and start talking about general things and or things that aren t too personal for them you could even try to encourage them by mentioning any problems that you had during your teenage years once you re at that level with them keep your promises tell the truth be reliable and most of all motivate them and give them advice where ever and whenever possible listen to what they have to say with respect and understanding wait until they ve finished speaking until you start speaking yourself show interest in what they re saying and empathise with them where necessary some teenagers don t really want too much pity but to know that they can just talk about it anyway can make them feel that little bit better it will then up to you to give them guidance and it will furthermore be up to them to listen to you and take on your words of wisdom in order to make them feel better ask them about anything that s concerning you even if they don t say it first if you notice any change in their behaviour or any signs of physical harm encourage them to talk about it to you and take action by intervening where and when necessary let them know that you do care about them and that you ll always be prepared to listen to them no matter what encourage them this could be a lot of things you could encourage them to for example plan their career stop smoking start attending school daily have faith in themselves etc with encouragement comes confidence the confidence that they can change and be exactly who they want to be some teenagers wouldn t mind if you set them with challenges that come with rewards while others may find it childish find out what methods works best for them and adapt to it it helps to give them the mindset that if they live their lives the right way good things will come their way have faith in them believe that they do have the power to change and that it sometimes takes more than just a push but a great leap showing that you genuinely believe in them will help you build your relationship with your mentee which will give them the confidence to confide in you more often and listen to what you have to say which in turn would motivate them to become a step closer to change and or figuring out their problems,Education-and-Communications

how to create an unschooling high school transcript,unschool is a nontraditional approach to education that focuses on a child s curiosity interests and strengths unlike homeschoolers people who are unschooled don t follow any set curriculum therefore it can be very difficult to come up with a transcript if you need one to apply to college to develop a transcript figure out what you need for your state and the potential college you should also follow the guidelines of a transcript and organize your educational experience into subject specific categories,know the state s requirements for graduation some states require a transcript of high school work while others don t however if you decide to make a transcript it needs to adhere to the state guidelines where you are graduating your transcript should take the work you have done and place them into the correct courses needed for your state s requirements most states have a set number of required credits in english math science

how to teach summary writing,summary writing is a really valuable skill but it can be tricky to teach new students if your pupils are young kids or esl learners they may not understand the purpose of summaries or have some difficulty expressing themselves in a concise way with a bit of time patience and repetition you can guide your students through the summary process while providing support and encouragement along the way,explain what a summary is to start your lesson describe a summary as a brief overview of a story article or other piece of writing note that summaries are completely factual and don t involve any opinions or arguments before you jump into the lesson let your students know that they ll be learning the basics of summarizing and practicing easy exercises 1 x trustworthy source read write think online collection of reading and writing resources for teachers and students go to source be encouraging throughout your lesson summarizing can be confusing and stressful to new students and your support and knowledge will help put them at ease it may help to use a projector powerpoint or other visual aid while you re explaining the basics of summarizing read a short story or essay with your class choose a short passage that won t take a long time to go over you can read the passage to your class or encourage your students to read it aloud if they so desire select a text that s easy to understand so your students don t get confused during the summarizing process 2 x trustworthy source reading rockets online resource supported by pbs providing research based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers go to source for instance if you re teaching younger kids consider using an excerpt from a children s book if you re working with older kids use an article biography or other passage that s easy to understand help your students highlight any important sentences or ideas as you read encourage your students to highlight or underline any important information that helps describe the passage overall invite them to look for essential information that answers the questions of who what when where why and how 3 x research source you can find useful templates online like readwritethink s website give an example summary to help your students use a popular story or passage to help your students understand what a proper summary looks like don t use the passage you just read instead choose a movie or tv show that your students are familiar with then offer an example summary based on that explain how your summary includes the basic information without including unnecessary details 4 x research source for instance if you were to summarize the movie titanic you may say something like a wealthy woman and a poor man meet on an expensive cruise ship as the ship sets sail they both fall in love despite extra complications their journey ultimately ends in tragedy as the boat sinks in the middle of the atlantic ocean remind your students that they ve probably summarized a story before like whenever they describe a movie or tv show to a friend ask your class to share the sentences they highlighted invite individual students to share sentences or phrases that they thought were important use a whiteboard projector or other type of technology to record your students answers into a collaborative list continue going around the class until everyone has shared their ideas 5 x research source for instance if you were reading a story like cinderella some main ideas could be how cinderella s stepsisters ruined her dress or how the fairy godmother gives her a new dress to wear if you re working with older students and reading a book like the pearl you may want to focus on when kino first finds the pearl as well as when he tries to sell it choose 5 main ideas that really sum up the main story go through the list of ideas that you ve collected from your students while you ve probably received some duplicates you may have some ideas listed that are more or less important than others invite your students to choose points that really capture the essence of the passage without lingering on unimportant details 6 x trustworthy source reading rockets online resource supported by pbs providing research based strategies for assisting children to become confident readers go to source for example in cinderella the fairy godmother giving cinderella a dress and carriage would be more important info to include in a summary than the fact that cinderella had a dog and cat if you re working with older students you may work with a story like the great gatsby in this case a main idea would be the pursuit and failure to find happiness as opposed to a statement on what gatsby s home looked like include transitional words to connect the ideas together separate the 5 main ideas into a list then start figuring out how to connect the points together encourage your students to use transitional phrases like next after this or at this point to make their summary sound smooth and polished work on an example summary together so your students have a clear idea of what they need to do 7 x research source if you re summarizing an article or passage where someone is stating their opinion use phrases like according to to keep your summary unbiased if you re summarizing a story like jack and the beanstalk try writing a summary like this jack uses his family s money to buy a packet of magic beans to prove to his annoyed mother that he didn t waste their money jack plants the seeds and climbs the beanstalk that grows at this point he finds a giant s kingdom and steals their golden egg which provides lots of money for jack s family in the end encourage your students to reword and paraphrase in the summary remind your class that they don t want to copy the words from the article verbatim which counts as plagiarism instead show them how to paraphrase sentences in their own words give your students time to practice rewriting their own sentences using the example passage and summary 8 x research source if the original text says something like the girl ran through the woods to escape her attacker you can paraphrase it to a wolf started chasing the girl so she ran very fast to get away if an essay or article says something like the government will try to pass the new law next year you can paraphrase it to according to members of the government the traffic law will be passed relatively soon add a concluding sentence to tie up the summary ask your students to come up with a sentence that helps tie up any loose ends in your communal summary explain that the sentence should wrap up the summary without restating any of the original information which would make the summary seem repetitive 9 x research source for instance a concluding sentence for a summary of star wars episode 6 could be luke leia and han reflect on the past before focusing on everything the future holds for them offer another passage for your students to read and mark down offer an article biography or other easy passage that your students can read quickly give them time to go through the passage and mark down 5 main ideas that can be included in the summary as well as the who what where when why and how try to let them figure out the information on their own so they can become more confident in their summary writing skills 10 x research source remind your students that you re there to help if needed for instance if you and your students are reading romeo and juliet you could mark down the who as romeo and juliet the what as a tragic love story the where as verona the when as shakespearean era the why as a family feud and the how as a pair of tragic suicides invite your class to write a practice summary after your students have collected the key points and information from the passage invite them to write a short summary that s only a few sentences long once they re finished writing review the summaries to see how well your students did give feedback whenever necessary and help your pupils to streamline their writing whenever possible 11 x research source for example a summary of three little pigs you can write something like three pigs have their lives frequently disrupted by a villainous wolf who destroys their home they are finally safe when they seek shelter in a sturdy house that the wolf cannot blow away a summary of the outsider might sound like this several boys are involved in a gang conflict that threatens to tear apart their small community encourage your students to try verbal summaries first if your students are hitting a roadblock ask them to verbalize what they ve just read in a few sentences this exercise may give them some helpful clarity and provide them with ideas for their written summary 13 x research source a verbal summary may sound like this star wars starts off in a galaxy far far away where a galactic war is currently going on the heroes of the franchise luke and leia fight against their long lost father who s the main enemy give your students practice questions to answer about summaries hand out a worksheet to your pupils along with some sample passages encourage students to work together to write practice summaries on the worksheet using the samples provided once they finish writing

how to use a two way radio policy to protect school students and staff,ensuring the safety of children and staff in america s schools is the single most important issue school boards and administrators must address police departments and other law enforcement cannot be left to deal with the issues of safety unique to centers for education alone or in concert with each other school administrators must make financial allowances for create and implement programs and strategies in coordination with law enforcement to better protect their facilities staff and the children they have taken responsibility for this guide will help administrators fulfill this weighty responsibility,purchase two way radios and chargers for use by each staff member administrators must calculate the number of staff employed and having access to their facility then order a corresponding number of two way radios and chargers plus ten staff should be counted as every single adult in regular attendance of the facility the extra ten radios should be distributed to anyone given access to the school facility for things such as contract work parents meeting with staff and law enforcement or security visits inspections purchase surge protectors that will accommodate all of the radio chargers plus ten additional the one time cost expenditure for this equipment for 70 individuals will be well under 3000 00 based on 1800 for radios and 280 for surge protectors at market value without a contract set up a secured room and stock it with all of the two way radio chargers select a small locked room in which to store radios while they are being charged at night and when not in use maintenance will be responsible for the management distribution and upkeep of this room and its contents assign each radio a number and mark each radio accordingly make a list of all the currently numbered locations in the facility this list should include each numbered classroom gymnasiums cafeterias outdoor locations where training takes place etc if there is no currently assigned number for a location excluding restrooms hallways closets and various storage facilities assign numbers and place them prominently at the physical location and then mark the appropriate radio with that number create a master list on a facility layout diagram use the same one provided to incoming students and staff and make sure all the location numbers are present on this diagram note the default channel the facility will be using for communication make copies of this diagram and distribute one copy should be given to the local police department one copy should be given to the local fire department one copy should be prominently displayed in the administrative office for each department including the cafeteria maintenance medical staff etc one laminated copy should be affixed to each entry exit point in the facility where it can be read easily additional copies will be used for daily clear logs for check in reporting by each radio operator and should be placed in the administrative office files for easy access all copies used for logs must be filled out with the date school name log in overseer name and must never be reused all logs are to be kept for the entirety of the school year in their original form establish a file for used log sheets and a file for blank copies select a reliable member of the facility s office personnel as the facility hub this individual will get their radio from the locked room each working day and after ensuring that it is in proper working order will take it to their workspace provide this individual with a log sheet copy daily and have them affix the date school name and their own name at the top of the layout sheet prominently assign a minimum of two reliable back up hubs for this responsibility this responsibility must be assigned to an adult employed by this facility not a trusted student or volunteer for legal purposes responsibilities for the hub will include coordination with maintenance supervisor responsible for two way radios chargers and surge protectors outlet extensions to ensure that necessary repairs requiring disbursement of funds or outside expert consultation are carried out satisfactorily day long interaction with each radio operator keeping the log for each radio communication with operators the hub will document the full name of each radio operator who checks out a radio each morning and the times that radio operator calls their check in clear as well as making a notation of the content of each radio transmission oversight of the operation of radio communication within the facility interrupting any chatter between users then documenting offenders coaching radio operators as necessary to ensure proper radio usage and reporting any malfunctions to administrative staff and documenting accordingly reporting emergencies to 911 operators and coordinating with law enforcement and emergency personnel during emergencies this hub is to provide the officials with their log sheet upon first contact so emergency officials will be aware of the exact location of the emergency report and all access points relative to that location in the event of an emergency the secondary hub person is to provide emergency workers and the tertiary hub with ongoing information regarding the completed evacuations via their copy of the clear and clear prepare for names school radio facility layout diagram the tertiary hub is to coordinate with law enforcement to offer information instruction and support to users in the process of evacuation visually checking the locked room area for broken door or window locks missing radios broken equipment and compromised electrical equipment then documenting conditions of the location on the log sheet before filing each end of day this is not a full time position the assignees should be familiarized with the process of filling out the logs alongside any other visitor log data sheet maintained by office personnel disburse two way radios to adult staff during a scheduled training meeting conduct a brief meeting with staff distribute radios based on the location to which each staff member is assigned demonstrate the proper use of the radio to attendees explain the rules of two way radio operation as follows the two way radio is to be used strictly for the purposes of securing the facility and its occupants never to be used in place of a telephone for private chatter between users each individual must go to the locked room and check out a radio upon arrival for work in the morning afternoon evening and return radio immediately prior to leaving the facility upon picking up radio user is to turn it on and go directly to their workspace upon entering their workspace the user must put down any items being carried except the radio and conduct a thorough visual inspection of their workspace after ensuring that workspace is safe for occupancy the user should press the microphone button when they don t hear anyone speaking through it and call out the number assigned to that two way radio and the word clear user may then place radio where it is visible and can be accessed easily at all times and prepare themselves for the workday upon initiation of class the user if a teacher with an assigned class must take the roll of students present and record properly on their paperwork then press the microphone button when no one can be heard speaking from it and clearly state the two way radio number and the word present or if necessary prepare for list when they hear confirm from the radio the user must clearly say then spell the name of any student unaccounted for so the absence can be noted by the hub user is to follow this procedure at the beginning of each scheduled class throughout the day when the user is ready to leave their assigned area at the end of the workday the user is to visually inspect their workspace area exit and lock any appropriate doors then press the microphone button and state the number assigned to the radio then the word clear the user is to then go directly to the locked room and turn the radio off place the radio on the appropriate charger see that the charging light displays then exit the building instruct teachers to pass along all instructions to their homeroom classes immediately and demonstrate proper use of the radio by checking in following the procedure this will ensure that should anything happen to a teacher students will be aware of the simplest means of immediate contact with help outside their physical location teacher should then place the radio in a visible and accessible location within the classroom with a firm warning to students to use it should an emergency arise teachers should remind students to maintain radio contact with others outside the location in the event of an emergency if at all possible instruct all staff members to report any unusual dangerous or suspicious activity through their radio immediately but succinctly user is to press the microphone button and first call out the radio number then state their location if they are not where they are assumed to be based on the radio number then state their emergency and let go of the microphone button emergency instructions to staff three channels will be used to communicate channel one is the default the user is to stay on this channel while inside facility channel two is for successful evacuations and evacuated without all charges reports channel three is for evacuation assistance instructions by direction of assigned hub user only press the microphone button state the radio number clearly state the word emergency if there is a fire tornado roof collapse etc then release the microphone button hub individual is to call the emergency services immediately and upon contact with operator state the name of the school and the two way radio user number of the user who has reported an emergency regardless of response heard user is to press microphone button again and briefly describe the emergency if possible users in the immediate vicinity of that radio users location should immediately take precautions to protect their charges by getting them out of the building and to their evacuation point users who have evacuated students must change their radios to the predetermined secondary communication channel and without interrupting other transmissions press the microphone button and state clear when they have moved their charges to their assigned evacuation point the assigned hub individual will use this channel to communicate instructions to evacuated staff so communication with those in potential danger will be uninterrupted on the default channel evacuated users should maintain their presence on this channel only and await instructions upon first responder arrival police the hub individual who is in direct contact with the user experiencing the emergency is to hand a two way radio to the officer even if the only radio at hand is their own and allow the officer to establish contact with the user experiencing the emergency the hub is to follow any instructions given by officers after getting another usable radio if time and the situation permits users of two way radios who remain in the building should turn their radios down upon hearing emergency and hold them close to their ear to prevent compromising their safety and revealing their location to potential intruders if possible they are to stay on the default channel that the emergency was reported on unless there is opportunity or need to switch channels and offer information relevant to the emergency itself they are to use what they hear and see to determine their best course of action users are to interact with officers to verify their location and condition upon request any user not experiencing the emergency due to proximity from disturbance report must evacuate and change radio frequency channel to the secondary channel upon successful evacuation any charge not accounted for while evacuating should be reported on the secondary channel upon arrival of evacuation point by radio number first following with the words clear or clear prepare for list upon hearing confirm user is to clearly state the name of any student they were unable to evacuate and their last known location within the facility the back up hub radio user should take a copy of the radio roster facility diagram from the file and record a check mark or highlight beside each radio user who reports clear and make notation of names and last known locations of missing students reported upon class evacuation users experiencing difficulties and or confusion following an emergency call by another user may check the secondary channel periodically and if hearing other users communicating wait until radio quiet then pressing microphone button state the radio number following location if different from radio assignment then ask for advice assistance to evacuate in the event of an emergency report from a user the tertiary back up hub should use their radio to direct staff reporting difficulties evacuating to the third designated channel for instructions if this radio user does not know what the emergency is or the location of the emergency at the moment a user requests assistance they are to instruct the user to maintain their presence on the default channel and wait for assistance or instructions notify local law enforcement of the radio procedure and the channels your facility intends to use for communication this will allow the law enforcement personnel to monitor and or use those frequencies to offer instructions to facility staff and each other without radio interference or confusion ask a local police official and local fire official to visit the facility introduce them to your three communication hubs and show them the two way radio roster facility diagram that you ve posted on each entry exit point tell them and provide them with a copy of the procedure you will follow during reported emergencies and what channel they should use to communicate directly with radio users within the facility using the two way radio policy conduct a tornado fire drill to ensure that all users are able to use the radio effectively and understand the new process stress the importance that every user maintain proper protocol throughout the exercise and troubleshoot resolve any conflicts discovered immediately

how to teach cause and effect to your kids,the concept of cause and effect seems obvious and natural to adults but for children especially younger ones the idea can be a bit more difficult to grasp it s important to teach cause and effect early though as it will be crucial for academics and even before that for daily life parents can play a significant role in helping children master the concept,interact with your child even young babies can begin to understand cause and effect they cry for example and someone comes to feed change or comfort them maximize this natural way of learning by responding to your baby and interacting in various ways make faces to get your baby to laugh pick your baby up if he or she reaches out for you offer toys babies and toddlers learn through play so offer a variety of toys suited to your child s developmental level your baby can learn that shaking a rattle creates a sound your toddler can learn that pressing certain buttons may make a toy light up or make a noise reinforce cause and effect through conversation as your child grows and understands more and more you can enhance their understanding verbally so for example you can say oh you didn t eat your lunch and that s why you re hungry again already or oh you were too rough with that balloon so it popped demonstrate toddlers can grasp cause and effect best with a practical demonstration puncture a balloon with a pin and see what happens or go to the kitchen sink with your toddler and pour water into a cup until it overflows ask your toddler what happened and why repeat with other household objects and procedures teach your child the vocabulary of cause and effect explain that a cause is an event or action that makes something happen an effect or consequence is a thing that happens as a result of that cause as your child gets older add additional vocabulary words like influence results and factors for example as well as words that will help with cause and effect sentence construction therefore consequently thus and others use the word because reinforce the relationship between causes and effects by using the word because in conversation it makes for better understanding for many kids so for example say your shoes are dirty because you stepped in the mud or the house is cold because we left the windows open explain why cause and effect relationships are important as your child grows you can point out that the principle of cause and effect is significant in a number of ways we try to discover the causes of things that are bad so that we can eliminate them and make the world better we try to discover the causes of things that are good so that we can apply them and maximize the results once your child starts school it s important to emphasize the academic uses of cause and effect scientists use it all the time what is causing global warming why did these plants die what will happen if we mix vinegar and baking soda and so do historians why did the american colonies revolt what happened after cortes conquered the aztecs make a t map a t map is a simple table with two columns on one side you can write causes on the other you can write effects for example on the left side write it is raining have your child brainstorm possible consequences it gets muddy flowers grow the school has indoor recess there are traffic jams write those on the right side of the table you can also use t maps for individual cause and effect relationships to illustrate language so in this case you would write it is raining at the top instead of on the left then on the left you d write it gets muddy because it is raining on the right you d write it is raining so it gets muddy this method teaches the two main forms of stating cause and effect the because form and the so form it also reinforces the concept play cause and effect games one example is the cause and effect chain choose a consequence say pants are dirty then have your child think of a potential cause for example i fell in the mud then you or another child follows up by saying the cause of that consequence it was raining and slippery continue as long as you can this game will help your child develop his or her understanding of cause and effect you can also play a simpler game where you offer an imaginary effect say the dog barked loudly and have your child think of as many possible causes as he or she can examples might include the dog barked loudly because the mailman came the dog barked loudly because someone pulled on its tail or the dog barked loudly because it saw another dog read books look for themed picture books designed to tackle causes and consequences read them with your child and talk about the situations presented in them create a timeline for older children draw a timeline on paper choose a historic event like a war and mark its important moments on the timeline connect those moments based on cause and effect teach analytical thinking as your child grows his or her understanding of cause and effect will get better and better and you can begin pushing for deeper more analytical thinking ask why something occurred and then follow up with how do you know or what s your evidence try asking what if questions to engage your child s imagination what if we accidentally used sugar instead of salt in this recipe what if the american colonies didn

how to prepare for the every 15 minutes program,every 15 minutes is a program for juniors and seniors in high school to reduce drunk and distracted driving it involves a mock drunk driving crash and students dying or being withdrawn from class every 15 minutes from there all participants are taken to a retreat for a multitude of activities been chosen to participate and don t know what to do read on,keep quiet if you ve been chosen chances are the rest of the student body doesn t know about the program in any case giving away the fact that you are to die will ruin the effects on your fellow classmates research the program your school may wish for you to not know much about the program to keep things a surprise but unless it s forbidden look up the program plenty of schools videotape and post the videos of their mock crashes online so you can watch to know what to expect there are also online news articles and websites that describe the program at lengths tell your parents your parents will most likely need to fill out some paperwork before you participate and be sure you give them proper notice beforehand pack because of the retreat at the end of the day you ll need to have extra clothes toiletries e t c be sure to have everything you think you ll need you will be cut off from the outside world it s also a good idea to pack tissues even if you don t consider yourself an emotional person you may be caught off guard by the events of the day get your hair out of your face whether you are in the mock crash or will be pulled out your face will probably be painted if necessary make it easier for the makeup artists by getting your hair away from your forehead and cheeks unless you have intentional facial hair a shave can t hurt either arrive for school a little early your luggage will stick out in the before school crowds and lots of people will notice if you don t arrive early you ll also have a little time for last minute questions and makeup if needed take the program seriously since you are a participant many of the outside students may be watching you to know how to react to the events of the day if you react to the crash and withdrawals seriously others are more likely to as well it s all fake but it will seem realer with realistic reactions be ready to write your letter at the end of the day you will receive a letter written by your parents and other relevant people in your life saying the things they wished they had told you before you died you will be asked to write letters back you are not required to write anything but if you wish to be thinking about what you d like to say have tissues ready during the second day you will be reunited with your parents and friends again making for some possibly emotional moments be sure your face is washed well the longer facepaint is left on the more stuck it gets stay serious the school will most likely have an assembly during which a video of the crash will be played and a memorial service for the dead students will be held again the student body will watch participants to know how to react so be a leader and stay solemn know what happened during the past day lots of students will ask you questions what it was like what happened after school at the retreat e t c know how to answer in advance it will come in handy between classes when you only have thirty seconds to explain remember the program the point is to reduce distracted and drunk driving so don t choose to forget the whole thing and text and drive the next week it will mean the whole program was useless spend some time thinking about what you learned what affected you most your worth to others how choices affect you whatever it was have it in mind and think of it so it changes who you are not just for a few days but for a lifetime tell others about your experience only a few students are chosen to participate in the program others are influenced but don t receive the same effects that participants do if you share your experience feelings and discoveries chances are that the program will be more effective revisit your letters and other mementos from the program as needed you may have times when you forget what you learned but use these souvenirs of sorts to bring you back and help you remember,Education-and-Communications

how to draw root locus of a system,a system with feedback becomes stable when equations describing that system possess roots that follow certain patterns otherwise the system will become unstable example of such an unstable system is when microphones create screeches part of the loudspeaker voice feedbacks to microphone and becomes amplified by amplifiers and then goes into the loudspeakers and again feds into the microphone and loops again and again until it saturates amplifiers into creating a high pitched noise feedback sometimes keeps the system just in the margin of instability and starts to make the system oscillating this might be useful in electronics and elsewhere to have a steady oscillation in a device such as a clock but if the margin has not been carefully calculated a small change might devastate the system into the destruction this is seen when some bridges have collapsed due to become oscillating and then into the instability runaway when people or cars or trains are passing over them a newly constructed london bridge opened for pedestrians for millennium was near to this runaway in the first day of its inauguration but as it was still under careful observation of the constructors was shut down and disaster did not happen root locus helps engineers to predict specification of their system to meet stability criteria although all academia are full of a plethora of software for drawing the root locus still it is fascinating for all learners of engineering to know the conceptual sketch of this method,know that the simplest system has an input and an output system comes between these two input goes into the system then becomes altered and then goes out as the desired output a system is built to create such a desired alteration for the output

sign for the input and a minus sign for the feedback output comes and through a feedback path goes to change the input when output y s comes out of the feedback it becomes y s times h s that is y s h s and becomes subtracted from the input x s therefore actually x s y s h s goes into the system x s y s h s goes into the system and becomes multiplied by the system function and comes out as x s y s

independent block it is correct that now this g s is not the same as previous g s as its gain k has been removed from it but it is convenient still to use the same notation for it as if we had a k

is not easy to find roots of a polynomial of degree greater than three or four and write it out in its roots factors as it is done in equation 5 this is one hurdle in drawing the root locus anyway for now it is assumed that such a factorization is known thus for a polynomial of degree n we have n complex roots ri begin from the simplest system the characteristic equation turns to be s k 0 changing k from 0 upward changes s from 0 to downward remember from high school you had questions such as to determine a parameter β such that a quadratic equation x2 x β 0 has two equal roots such or similar questions that was a basic root locus problem parametrized with β you knew you should calculate discriminant and put it equal to zero to meet the prescribed condition δ 1 4β 0 and hence β 1 4 solve a similar root locus for the control system depicted in the feedback loop here instead of discriminant the characteristic function will be investigated that is 1 k 1 s s 1 0 a manipulation of this equation concludes to the s2 s k 0 ask questions regarding k begin from k 0 you have two real roots s 0 and s 1 since characteristic equation is s2 s 0 increase k you have still two real roots until k 1 4 where two roots will be equal that is s1 s2 1 2 increase k 1 4 discriminant will be negative you have two imaginary roots as complex conjugate to each other but the real value of both roots remain the same and equal to 1 2 increasing k has no effect whatever on this only imaginary parts will become larger the root locus is drawn in heavy lines there are two roots for this quadratic polynomial and definitely they join in one point on the real line for certain value of parameter k that makes discriminant equal to zero and creates a repeated root the portion of the real line between these two roots is part of the root locus this point is called σ point or branching point of the asymptotes of the root locus up to this value of k system damps without overshoot undershoot does not quiver before stopping at k 1 4 system damps critically after that increasing k only increases the imaginary part of the created conjugate roots that makes the branching of the root locus perpendicular to real line theoretically all along this line system damps but with tremors practically increasing gain can make the system unstable tremors might become so persistent that trigger unwanted frequencies

easier if you could just take your child s existing iep with you especially if the program is benefiting your child unfortunately it s not always that easy while all ieps must meet the requirements in

transferring your child s school records to their new school should be relatively easy if you are moving within the same district the two schools likely have similar records systems and management you still need to request the transfer as early as possible to make sure the records are there before the child s first day provide both schools with the date your child will start at the new school if at all possible transfer between terms so your child has time to acclimate and perhaps tour the new school before starting for normal changes within the same school system such as if your child is graduating from middle school to high school records will be automatically sent up to the next school you shouldn t have to do anything attend an iep meeting at your child s new school even within the same district your child s new school will hold an iep meeting to go over the child s iep this will also be an opportunity for you to meet your child s new teachers as well as specialists who work at the new school if possible have your child s teachers or specialists from the old school come to the iep meeting and talk to the new teachers and specialists they can offer insight into how to work best with your child make any necessary adjustments your iep is created at the district level therefore if your child transfers to a different school in the same district your child s iep won t change however adjustments may still be necessary depending on the resources available at the school 2 x research source many specialists work district wide so your child may be working with some of the same people however their schedule may be different since they are at a different school while the iep itself won t change some of the details may have to be altered to fit the new school for example they may have special classes on a different day than they did before talk to your child about these changes and make sure they understand it may take your child some time to adjust particularly if they are attached to their routine have your child s current school transfer records to the new school let your child s current school know your child s first day at their new school and make sure their records will be there before that date try to start this process at least 2 to 3 weeks before you move allow at least a week for the transfer then call your child s new school and find out if the records are there if not call the child s current school and find out if they ve been sent when the records are sent write down the date they were sent for your records you also want to get a full copy of your child s records for yourself ask your child s current doctor for referrals if you re moving far enough away that your child will no longer be able to see the same doctors and therapists you ll have to find new ones locally your child s current doctor may know comparable professionals they can recommend 3 x research source a full written referral will provide new doctors or therapists with information about your child and how best to work with them get a full copy of your child s medical records before you leave so you have them if necessary discuss your child s iep with staff at

how to choose a school,choosing a school can be a very stressful experience parents and kids alike have deep worries about finding a place where the children will be healthy happy and be prepared for a bright future here is how you can find a great school this guide is primarily targeted at people looking for schools for those 5 18 years old not universities,get the test scores test scores are not the whole picture but many parents will start out there determine the online source for school rankings it is different in different states and countries but you will find it if you search online for school rankings for your location for example in california usa every school has its ranking by test score listed on california department of education website 1 x research source in the uk you can find these rankings at ofsted 2 x research source you can also find more subjective ratings on other websites like greatschools and many others know that test scores don t tell the whole story there are many factors that influence test scores and not all of these truly indicate the quality of the overall learning experience or the experience your child will have wealthier areas have parents that can afford coaches and tutors so if you find a school in a poorer area that is above average for its income level you may have a real winner note that test scores are typically reported by school there will be test score variation by teacher and by set of students getting a teacher at a school is sort of like getting a lawyer from a law firm it doesn t matter if the law firm is the top one if they give you their worst lawyer visit the website of the school if their school has won awards for excellence you can bet those will be listed ensure the school offers the classes your child wants larger schools are more likely to have a diversity of classes offered also ask about other electives extracurriculars find out if the school offers the non academic things you might be looking for such as band sports debate theater ask students who study in that school about its role in their lives i e are they motivated in other activities besides studies talk to others find parents and children that are currently at the school and talk with them about their experiences you should be able to find people to talk to you in most cases by friends of friends or just online if you are far away you can ask the school for references if they did not want to help you that is probably a bad sign get a tour of the school simply visit the school s website to inquire about tours almost any school will allow prospective parents and students to visit if they simply ask tours can be for both parents and children most times parents would want the child to see the school as well many schools will also have the opportunity for a child to visit an actual classroom which is very helpful make sure you see lunch and recess time ensure non classroom time has adequate supervision and the kids look happy non supervised time on a playground is a big stress factor for many children ask about teacher credentials experience and turnover rate these factors are not necessarily good or bad but can inform your decision credentials are not always important many of the best teachers at private schools do not have them experience in class management matters even more than qualification a high turnover rate of teachers is rarely a good thing experience in teachers is usually good but some experienced tenured teachers are not engaged similarly a lot of young teachers is not necessarily good or bad some are very enthusiastic and energetic others inexperienced and not good at classroom management know if there are any accommodations for any special needs your child may have special needs parent groups online or offline can be useful most places require schools to accommodate special needs but not all are eager or willing gifted children also can require special accommodations some parents seek out particular programs for their children parents may look for stem science technology engineering and math focused schools language immersion schools and others make sure your child will be safe at school you can rule schools out by neighborhood a great school may not be great for your child if the school is dangerous others may be too far from your house or not have good transportation walk around the school try to get a feel for the overall campus environment is it clean well maintained does it feel safe stop by the school office to get a pass to come on campus or arrange a tour many schools do not allow people to come onto school property unannounced while school is in session for security reasons this does not mean they have something to hide check transportation options make sure transportation to and from school is convenient and safe if transport to the school is by bus take the bus to school during commute time buses can be dangerous or just very rowdy by experiencing you will feel and know what it will be like if transport by car go by the school during drop off hours to ensure it is doable for you if transport is by foot or bicycle ensure there are good safety precautions such as walkways or bicycle paths once you have decided on a school you can attempt to enroll most schools offer both online registration and in person registration see the instructions for the things you will need to enroll many local schools will require proof that you live in the area of the school elite schools may require more detailed applications and or aptitude tests in the usa publicly funded schools are not allowed to choose which students they can accept but they instead have regulations for how they choose when they have limited space if you do not live in the area of the school you may have different or special instructions find if the school you want has space available for new students some schools will take new students any time others do not have space if the school has limited space available read up on when enrollment starts you will want to be first in line or first online during the registration period for best chances if your child has any special needs consider if you want to discuss them with the school when applying in some cases you want to ensure the special needs will be met before applying in other cases you may not want to disclose the school may be required to provide services that are expensive,Education-and-Communications
how to keep kids engaged in a remote classroom,having the right tools and technologies to run a remote classroom doesn t make a difference if the kids aren t engaged and actively learning fortunately there s plenty you can do to keep your students engaged even though they re not sitting in front of you in a physical classroom kids need structure but their minds also need to be stimulated so they re focused and the material sticks they also need to know that they can reach out to you for help and that you care about them despite the distance and impersonal nature of the internet,tell your kids an interesting fact at the beginning of your lessons whenever you post a lesson or assignment for your students lead with an interesting fact that will perk up their interest and get their brains working right off the bat chances are the fact will stick in their heads so choose one that s relevant to your lesson to help reinforce the entire lesson 1 x research source for instance in a lesson about stars you could say something like did you know that when you look at a star you re looking back in time because of how long it took the light to travel to your eyes start live classes with a warm up activity to get them engaged if you do live video classes with your students get their brains warmed up with a simple 5 minute assignment at the beginning of your remote class when they re finished have a question and answer session where you ask individual students questions or have a group discussion where the students talk about the assignment 2 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source use a quick class warm up to break through the impersonal and distant feeling that remote classrooms can have for example you could put up 2 similar pictures and have the students spot the differences between them you could also do a short journal assignment where the students talk about their weekend and then have them read their entries aloud use movement activities to keep the kids focused staring at a book or a screen can lull anybody to sleep so to keep your kids actively engaged add some movement activities that relate to the material so they re using their bodies and focusing their minds find ways to include movement into a lesson to get your students blood pumping and to help reinforce the material 3 x research source for instance you could include a hand clapping pattern that goes along with multiplication tables ask the kids to stand up and stretch for a few minutes whenever they finish a lesson or assignment so they aren t stuck in a chair the whole time include musical elements in your lessons to help the kids learn there s a reason commercial jingles get stuck in your head use musical elements to help facts and information stick in their brains and to keep them engaged in the class look for music videos and songs that talk about a subject you re teaching in class and include a link to them in your assignments so your students can listen and learn more about the topic 4 x research source a classic example is schoolhouse rock which has a ton of educational songs about topics such as conjunctions electricity and even how a bill becomes a law search online for songs that talk about science history or math that you can incorporate into your lessons add creative exercises and activities to break things up include activities that allow your students to use their creative energy so they re excited to learn and are more engaged in the class use a creative project or activity as a way to reinforce or illustrate a concept or idea that you re teaching them to help it stick in their minds 5 x research source for example you could have your kids draw a picture of the sun s rays feeding plants to help illustrate photosynthesis make the activities fun as well for instance your students could draw and design their own cells and include structures from real cells so they re also learning their functions assign group projects that get students to collaborate with each other because your classroom is remote it s more difficult for your students to interact and collaborate with one another so it s important that you include projects and assignments that require them to communicate and work together put your students into groups and give them each an assignment that they have to complete they can use your learning management system lms a messaging app or a video conferencing app to work together 6 x research source have your students assign parts of their project to each other for instance if you assign a group project about shakespeare 1 student can talk about his sonnets 1 can talk about his plays and another can talk about his life set up an online space for your kids to interact with each other social skills and collaboration are important elements of learning and using an online forum chat room or a video conference is a great way for your students to talk to each other use an online space that s designed for students or set up a video conference that your students can log in to so they can see and talk to each other 7 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source a few examples of online spaces for students include newcomment where students can upload their work and discuss it with other students and yo teach which is a program that allows you to create and moderate a chatroom for students you could also use video conferencing apps like zoom microsoft teams or google hangouts to let students see and talk to each other get your students familiar with new technology to help them engage avoid overwhelming your kids with tons of new apps and technologies at once teach them how to navigate the lms so they can find links and assignments explain how to use online chat rooms forums or video conferencing programs so they feel confident using it if your students feel confident they re much more likely to engage in your class 8 x research source if a student is struggling to access a program or technology ask their parents to help them spend time in the first 1 2 weeks of your class getting your kids familiar with all of the tools you ll be using break up content into smaller pieces so it s easier to absorb learning in a remote classroom environment can be more taxing physically and intellectually than a traditional classroom setting avoid assigning long text passages large sections of material at once or even playing videos longer than 10 minutes or you may lose your kids focus instead chunk the content into smaller pieces so your students are better able to understand and retain the information 9 x research source for example rather than assigning an entire chapter to be read during class assign a few paragraphs at a time then check in with your kids before assigning more material so they stay focused on the task a transition to remote learning can be stressful try to give your students a bit more leeway than you normally would which will help them feel more comfortable in the new environment 10 x expert source jai flicker academic tutor expert interview 20 may 2020 send regular feedback to your students so they can track their progress keep your students updated with how they re doing in your class so they ll more actively participate send them a short message or email their parents periodically to let them know how they re performing and what they can do to improve 11 x research source if they have additional questions or want to know what they can do to improve their grades ask them to reach out during your office hours so you can assist them give parents tools they can use to help their kids learn include links in your learning management system and in your weekly emails to parents that provide resources and materials that parents can use to help their kids learn at home enlisting the help of your student s parents can help them be more engaged in class and retain the material better 12 x research source it s always helpful to encourage parents to get involved in their children s education and you can really help them out by giving them resources and materials they can use make sure your students know how they can reach you it s important that you re available and that your students and their parents know when and where they can reach you so they participate in your class more effectively make sure they know when you re available for office hours and how they can send you a message or get in touch if they need you 13 x research source a student is more likely to be engaged in your class if they feel like they can reach you when they need you because it s easy for students to feel disconnected or distant online try your best to be present in their lives and show them that you want them to engage with you give clear directions so your students know what they need to do make sure your written directions are clear and explain the assignment in detail so your students don t feel lost or overwhelmed if your students get frustrated because they don t understand an assignment they may not want to do it 14 x research source write your directions using a warm informal tone as though you re speaking to your students and not like they re reading from an old stuffy textbook email updates and information to the parents once a week parents can make useful allies when it comes to keeping kids engaged but only if they re kept in the loop and know what s going on in the classroom send a friendly email at least once a week that gives parents a brief overview of the material you re going over and directs them to any new content or information you ve added to the learning management system 15 x research source mention upcoming assignments and any other reminders so the parents are aware of any deadlines include your contact information and availability for easy reference in case they need to get in touch with you don t single out individual students or family members in your weekly emails send group messages to your students for quick reminders if your students are old enough to use group messaging send them short messages to remind them of upcoming deadlines or to check in and make sure they don t have any questions about assignments keep the messages short and invite the students to reach out to you if they re having any issues or they need help with something 16 x research source checking in with your students will keep them focused and engaged hold office hours so students and parents can reach out to you set a 1 2 hour period each day where students or their parents can contact you to ask about their grades assignments material or anything else they have questions about during your office hours stay close to your email or phone so you can quickly respond to messages or calls 17 x research source be sure to let your students and their parents know if you need to cancel your office hours for the day reach out directly to a student that s struggling if you have an individual student who is falling behind or struggling with their grades reach out to them directly and ask if they re having any issues with the remote class or with the material show them that you care about them and you want them to learn and they re more likely to want to participate and engage 18 x research source sometimes it can be as simple as a student struggling to access the material or the technology and if you give them a hand it can make world of a difference if a student continues to struggle try reaching out to their parents individually by email as

the types of extracurricular activities available to them by doing your research and knowing what to look for you can make sure you choose a great school for your child,define your ideal school before you even start looking it s important to decide what is most important to you for your child you can use criteria like foreign language opportunities strength in arts and sciences or a variety of other factors you find important to narrow down your choices once you decide what is important use the school s website information available in pamphlets or in person visits to make sure the prospective school has proper offerings 1 x research source create a list of values you re looking for in a school with your parenting partner or even with your child if they are older a great way to understand how important something is to a school is to look at their available faculty and resources schools that have a lot of teachers and a demonstrated willingness to invest will be more likely to be strong in an area also keep in mind things like travel time if it is a public school find out whether where you live has available bussing if you are going to need to drive your child to school every morning make sure the distance and start times work with your own schedule keep an open mind to multiple options if your area has a variety of school types ranging from public private or charter schools don t limit yourself how a school receives its funding whether government or privately funded does not necessarily correlate to quality of education look around online go to a school district office or attend an information fair to get a closer look 2 x research source know the numbers schools should have statistics available to prospective parents that demonstrate performance on tests student teacher ratio and how many of the students continue on to college or employment depending what you find important contact the school s main office and request this information for public programs states will make available school district performances 3 x research source visit your possible choices no amount of research reading or calling can substitute for an in person examination call the school and ask for a your bring your child with you when you go to the school and make sure you talk to the principal teachers and if possible other parents this is a great time to get an overall feel for what sorts of people run and attend the school to decide whether it s a good fit look at the classrooms the artwork on the walls and if possible watch a teacher in action so you can see what sorts of interaction and activities your student will get 4 x research source if a school doesn t encourage pre enrollment visits this may be a red flag to inquire about this may mean that they are not transparent about their teaching methods and it could be predictive of how responsive they will be in the future to any concerns you may have choose a school that is transparent and tries to assuage your concerns ask why they do not allow pre enrollment visits ask the right questions before you visit the school create a list of questions based on the values you think are important when you visit the school ask your questions make sure you know about the school s hours for your own schedule what sorts of lunches they serve their foreign language offerings and sports teams 5 x research source if you want to get even more in depth you can ask how their teachers are trained details on homework and how they handle poor behavior ask around for school recommendations you may have friends who already have children in a particular school find out from them you may want to consider enrolling your child into the same school know the details of application and enrollment there can be a lot details that help dictate your decision if it is a private school find out about financial aid offerings whether your child will need to be interviewed or whether admission is lottery based and whether you ll need to secure recommendations on your child s behalf make sure you are able to financially afford tuition prices 6 x research source if you want to move forward you may need to secure paperwork verifying your child s age identity vaccinations and residency if you are unable to do any of this you ll want to know to avoid any unexpected surprises have a backup plan even if you have a dream school sometimes there are waiting lists a rigorous application process or even financial obstacles make sure you have other options waiting so that you are not shut out of all your options and forced to send your child to a less than ideal school decide the environment you want for your child for preschool there are a lot of different options and approaches you may want something that is more play centered versus something that is educational you may also have an opinion about whether you want your child in a busy environment with lots of activity and classmates or more individual oriented environments that focus on developing particular skills 7 x research source decide on the educational structure you want there are many approaches to young child education 8 x research source play based programs are activities aim to use play to develop skills this is also known as child centered many times these classrooms are broken up into different sections such as home or kitchen science area water table reading space and a space with blocks and toys this encourages students to gain skills through play academic focused programs are typically teacher led and provide more structure this is similar to a kindergarten setting and aimed at preparing a child for their next steps in school this is also for parents who want more structure and fear the chaotic environment of play based programs decide on the educational philosophy important to you there are different philosophies for how to best teach children and prepare them for success 9 x research source montessori this is a method that was developed in rome this focuses on letting children learn at their own pace and allows them to work at whatever educational level they are at it has less emphasis on teacher directing the children and lets children explore puzzles and toys on their own being rewarded by the successful completion of a task and not verbal reinforcements from an adult this is great for parents who want their children to develop leadership skills and independence 10 x research source waldorf this is a method emphasizes reading creative learning reading singing and acting there is also a great emphasis on cooperation amongst students one thing that is unique about this method is the exclusion of media such as computers videos electronics and no focus on academic tasks like tests homework or even desks this method is great for parents who want their child to develop individualism 11 x research source reggio emilia this is a style that encourages students to explore and engage in project based learning lessons are based on the interest of the students instead of the teacher directing questions it might ask the student to explore outside and to ask questions and pursue education through their own encounters and interests the projects are then framed by the student to encourage this 12 x research source investigate the staff and administration this is important because they will be the ones directing the curriculum instilling values and disciplining your child meet with them and find out their methods and views on things of importance tour the school bring your child with you when you visit the school to determine if it would be a good fit for them inspect the facilities ask about the teachers qualifications and get a feel for what kind of environment the school has find out what the daily schedule is and ask about parent involvement 13 x research source take into account social and emotional factors whereas a younger child may not have built up a lot of friends older children looking for a middle or high school will have important social and emotional factors that affect their well being if your child already has a group of friends that have a positive impact on their life you may want to not break this arrangement up also things like bullying can become more prominent in older children find a school that has a strong anti bullying policy and helps your child build up solid social skills 14 x research source finding out what sort of guidance counselor availability a school has can be one important factor in limiting bullying take elective offerings into consideration around this age your children will start to be developing interests and schools will have offerings beyond the basics of education like math english and writing technology courses foreign languages and other special offerings can really distinguish one school from the next ask to see what electives the school has and sit down to talk to your kid and see how they may align with their interests it is also a good idea to ask the school specifics about their programs such as student to faculty ratios faculty training and funding available to support students ask about their post graduate planning program in high school your child may be starting to consider whether they want to continue on to college or pursue a trade schools that offer ap classes for college credit a guidance program for navigating the application process and even internship options are great for someone looking to continue on to college 15 x research source if your child is interested in a trade see if the school has an option to receive hands on or technical training in various fields ask for statistics about where graduate go to college and what sorts of schools they get into this can give you a general idea how well prepared students are for continuing on to college see if they have options for students who are advances or excel at subjects a high school with flexibility and a willingness to challenge students who go above and beyond can be great preparation for academic excellence down the road see what extracurricular activities they offer by the time your children reach middle or high school they may have interests in a particular sport playing a musical instrument or perhaps as a budding thespian schools that are able to financially support your child s interests outside the classroom can provide a more edifying educational experience and help make them into more rounded maturing adolescents find out how prospective schools rank in any competitive sports your child is interested in decide whether you want a private or public school while where a school receives its funding does not necessarily make it better or worse than another school there are differences between public and private schools worth paying attention to perhaps you want the structure of a religious education in which case a private religious based school may be a good option you ll also want to take into consideration other factors like whether your child has friends in the community already how far you are able to drive and what you are able to financially afford 16 x research source the main difference between public and private school options is funding this can play a role in deciding the type of education your child will get public schools are funded by the government and thus typically have to follow set curriculums this will mean it will be largely standardized and have to adhere to certain standards private schools do not have to adhere to these and their independence can be a strength if your child has special needs public schools are mandated by law to accommodate whereas private schools will vary from one institution to another 17 x research source,Education-and-Communications
how to help achieve universal primary education,achieving universal primary education is one of the un s eight millennium development goals substantial progress has already been made in 2000 only 83 of children attended primary school by 2015 it was up to 91 while universal elementary education isn t a goal one person can achieve alone it is achievable after all in most of the developed world universal primary education is mandatory you can help realize this goal by supporting programs that help advance the goal becoming an effective advocate and working in the field,research programs and agencies there are a multitude of un governmental and intergovernmental programs actively working toward universal primary education you ll be better prepared to support programs advancing the goal when know which agencies are most active in the field some of the major organizations are 1 x trustworthy source united nations official site for the united nations an intergovernmental organization devoted to maintaining peace and building relationships between all nations go to source the united nations girls education initiative ungei is a un agency focusing on education among women because women and girls around the world are far more likely to be unschooled than men and boys ungei partners with agencies in individual countries offering technical support in the design and funding of schools 2 x research source abriendo oportunidades opening opportunities is another un initiative this time based in guatemala which focuses on the education and mentoring of school age girls 3 x research source the global education cluster is the premier un agency addressing the difficulties associated with providing education to those in conflict zones it aims to make the provision of educational resources a standard practice in the dispensation of humanitarian aid it isn t now 4 x research source donate if you ve found some private agencies that share your vision the most straightforward way to help them is by giving a donation your donation can be monetary or in kind 5 x research source there are dozens if not hundreds of private nonprofit groups active in assisting education in developing areas you can see a partial listing of highly regarded nonprofits at http campaignforeducationusa org members vote to increase nonmilitary foreign aid the un has no independent authority to tax individuals contributions to goals set by the un are determined by individual countries and disbursed through the un when you hear the term foreign aid it s a blanket term describing all types of aid including aid to help advance the millennium development goals 6 x research source while you can t pick exactly where foreign aid will go most nonmilitary foreign aid will at least help advance educational goals indirectly for example malnutrition poverty and disease are big reasons why any particular child isn t attending elementary school support efforts at reducing military conflict while more children overall are in primary school compared to fifteen years ago the opposite is true when it comes to children in conflict zones in conflict zones the proportion of children out of school has increased to 36 from 30 a discrepancy high enough to indicate a relationship between the types of wars fought today and the disruption in educational services 7 x trustworthy source united nations official site for the united nations an intergovernmental organization devoted to maintaining peace and building relationships between all nations go to source therefore it should be clear that military solutions to global problems are not solutions to problems of school enrollment whatever their other merits may be spread the word amongst friends and associates talking to your friends colleagues and family about barriers to universal worldwide enrollment can prepare you for more serious advocacy explain to the people in your circle the importance of primary education and just how close the international community is to solving the problem even if they don t care about the issue as much as you do they should walk away from the encounter understanding why it s important yet solvable problem as always tailor your appeal to the individual think about their experiences and sympathies so your pitch sinks in for example imagine your friend is a person who prides themselves on being self made even though you care about universal primary education in a way they don t you can make them care about the issue talk to your friend about the ripple effect a nonexistent elementary education has on a person s life you could open by saying something like this you ve managed to go out and achieve a lot which is pretty exceptional but can you imagine how hard it would have been if you didn t know multiplication tables the scientific method or how to read would you have been able to achieve what you ve managed to achieve if you hadn t it s easier to influence a new opinion than change their mind try to talk about unfamiliar subjects or by approaching new subjects in unfamiliar ways take advantage of social media twitter instagram facebook and other social media platforms are a cheap way to raise awareness of any type of issue you can reach large audiences with comparatively little effort plus there s always the possibility of an issue going viral remember kony 2012 8 x research source use social media to promote articles videos and memes that tackle issues relating to problems caused by inadequate primary education and initiatives designed to stop it sometimes the reach of social media is larger than its impact remember kony 2012 even though it s a low cost way to broadcast a message social media by itself doesn t create change in fact relying too much on social media can turn your activists into slacktivists or people who are constantly hitting the share button to spread a message but do nothing else 9 x research source transform your opinions into media you can take your advocacy one step further by creating content centered around achieving universal primary education content creation just means creating any type of media like hosting or contributing to podcasts blogs and vlogs 10 x research source while creating your own blog podcast or youtube channel is more work if you want complete control over messaging it s the only way to go see start your own podcast and start a blog to learn more join a preexisting group by joining a group that s already established the message is amplified in accordance with the strength of the group even though you sacrifice control over the message the group helps give you credibility and access you wouldn t ordinarily have in addition to the aid agencies and programs outlined in the first section there are several private entities devoted to addressing this issue such as the jesuit refugee service books for africa results school girls unite and the united methodist board of church and society 11 x research source saying i advocate with a group called results which addresses global poverty and educational resources i d like you to know a few things we do has a much better ring to it than you know what i think reach out to people in power take your message to people who have the power to make the changes you want to make with an international effort to address primary education there are many different decision makers and many ways to communicate with them for example you can write a letter to the editor of your local newspaper your congressman senator mayor or other political figure let them know how close the un member states are to achieving the goal of universal primary education and how increased foreign aid could make a serious dent in the problem advocate in support of diplomatic efforts to broker peace treaties or simply highlight the efforts of a group you belong to 12 x research source start an online petition and publish it on social media if you don t think you own voice is enough amplify it sometimes change isn t possible until elected officials understand how many people care about an issue 13 x research source if you gather enough signatures printing out a hard copy can be a very dramatic gesture the big stack of papers is more visually impressive than a pdf with a few thousand signatures be a voluntourist voluntourism means planning a tourist experience around volunteer activity and it is a growing sector of international travel instead of your vacation revolving around pleasure activities it centers on service activities 14 x research source while voluntourism is well intentioned it isn t a cure all for the world s problems if it puts a native worker out of a job it can even cause more problems

how to reduce sedentary time in schools,everyone realizes that skyrocketing obesity rates not just among adults but also children present a global health hazard efforts to reduce obesity among children tend to focus on healthier eating and more exercise but cutting down on sedentary behavior sb like screen time or simply sitting on the bus or in school needs to be a point of emphasis as well 1 x research source because children spend a significant amount of time in school making changes there to reduce sedentary time can offer health benefits on its own as well as help to change overall behavior patterns,break up sedentary time most children are by nature active beings but being required to sit for long stretches such as at a school desk can help to ingrain more sedentary behavior sb patterns there has to be some amount of sedentary time in order for learning to take place but interspersing sit down time with even brief activities is an important step toward altering sb patterns 2 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source brief activities or energizers interspersed throughout the day not only help reduce the overall amount of sedentary time per day they also can benefit health focus and academic achievement for instance students who take a 10 minute walk before a test have been shown to display better focus increased relaxation and thus better scores adjust your class schedule if necessary aim to alternate between sedentary activities and activities that encourage movement for example begin with a math lesson schedule in free play teach a reading lesson then engage in an activity that encourages gross motor skills 3 x research source create active lessons and assignments for teachers reducing sedentary time in school often boils down to basic alterations like designing class activities that require students to stand instead of sit or move around instead of remaining still active lessons and homework require students to do more than watch a video work on a computer or read a textbook they require them to get up and get moving 4 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source consider for instance the difference between learning how paper is made by watching a video as opposed to getting your hands into some mushy wood pulp the first option reinforces sb patterns like staring at a tv or other screen device while the second promotes active hands on engagement beyond the possible health benefits many children will gain more from more active forms of learning anyway schedule group projects that incorporate movement as well when planning for a certain unit aim to find activities that will keep your students active for instance have your students measure their body parts during an anatomy lesson or practice multiplication using jumping jacks stand instead of sit some workplaces have begun to transition from traditional desks to taller chair free standing desks or even the so called treadmill desk should this concept take off widely in schools it would no doubt significantly reduce daily sitting time it may seem like a small difference but the simple act of standing instead of sitting can offer several health benefits 5 x research source the cost involved in switching to standing desks is not inconsequential of course but teachers can work to increase standing time in other ways as well recurring or random times when the students must stand at their desks instead of sitting can be incorporated into the daily routine for instance you can encourage movement in your classroom by having an empty open area that is accessible to all students move chairs and desks away from this area so the children can use the space to stay active 6 x research source give kids options kids like adults tend to respond better to changes when they feel like they have some measure of choice or control over the process rather than simply dictating a set list of changes to reduce sedentary time it is preferable to offer a range of alternate activity options from which the kids can choose if they feel like active agents of change at school they may be more likely to carry such positive changes home as well 7 x research source for instance teachers can offer a set of daily physical activity dpa bins from which students can choose from a variety of games and activities or a greater emphasis can be placed upon offering a range of intramural activities including sports but also activities like dancing yoga etc that emphasize fundamental movement skills offer incentives and rewards it is important to let kids know that decreasing sedentary behavior can help improve overall health reduce obesity and enhance academic performance however such concepts can be a bit abstract especially in comparison to some old fashioned age appropriate rewards for smaller kids simple incentives like stickers or bracelets can spur enthusiasm for making changes for older kids providing pedometers or accelerometers can act as a combined reward and self monitoring device one of the numerous programs established in schools to reduce sb emphasizes replacing sedentary screen time with physical activities that focus on mastering six core skills running throwing dodging striking jumping and kicking in this case the reward itself achieving mastery reinforces the desired behavioral change 8 x research source join the larger battle against obesity school focused programs to improve healthy eating increase daily exercise and reduce sedentary behavior especially screen time often exist separately even though they are by and large working toward the same goal reducing childhood obesity rates combining these efforts into a coordinated integrated program can add consistency and focus to the overall effort and thereby increase the likelihood of support from kids and families 9 x research source combining efforts does not mean minimizing the importance of addressing sedentary behavior sb however while eating healthier and exercising more can seem more important on the surface reducing the amount of sedentary time is important on its own and serves as a gateway to making those changes as well less sedentary time naturally leads to more exercise and usually decreases unhealthy eating activities like mindless snacking on junk foods recognize the stakes fortunately for school administrators and other interested parties seeking to change sb among students ample evidence exists regarding the negative impacts of excessive sedentary time and the benefits of decreasing it kids and perhaps more importantly parents may be more likely to respond positively when presented with clear evidence of the value of reducing sedentary time 10 x research source repeated scientific studies have shown that increased sedentary time decreases fitness metabolic rate self esteem and academic performance and increases hunger stimulus obesity rates and aggressive behavior in turn decreased sedentary time which for instance in canada is estimated to entail 62 of the waking hours for an average child has the opposite effects make an effort to communicate these facts and the school s progress toward the goals for active times on a regular basis integrate programs regarding sb throughout the curriculum while programs to reduce sedentary time seem like natural fits for physical education classes and recess periods for instance they are more effective when they are incorporated into the entire school day from standing up during math lessons to doing hands on activities during history class to scheduling activity breaks before tests changing sb needs to be seen as a total team effort 11 x research source one of the early efforts at reducing sb in schools known as the planet health program was integrated throughout the curriculum in its test sites and subsequent programs such as switch play and active for life have tended to follow suit researchers have understood that changing behaviors as ingrained as sitting in on a bus at a desk or in front of a tv or computer screen cannot be effectively changed piecemeal but only as part of a holistic approach that addresses core behavioral patterns you can create an anti sb committee with representatives for administrators educators parents and students hold regular meetings and work toward reducing sb time during the school day get families and the community involved like most school based programs and education in general parental involvement is critical to the success of programs intended to address sb to truly succeed programs must involve intense behavioral interventions to address the core behaviors that tend to increase sedentary time behavioral changes made in school can carry over into the home and community but only with the support of those outside the school walls 12 x research source 13 x research source parents need to be informed and involved in every step of the process when sb programs are initiated explain why students are standing up more taking activity breaks and being advised to reduce screen time provide activities and alternatives for the home setting and opportunities for parents to get actively involved in the program both in and out of school make it clear that changing sb is beneficial for everyone kids and adults alike,Education-and-Communications
how to choose activities for your duke of edinburgh s award,the duke of edinburgh s award here abbreviated to dofe is an award for 14 24 year olds done all over the world but mainly based in countries of the commonwealth there are three levels bronze 14 silver 15 and gold 16 each comprises of four sections of activities which must be done for an hour a week for a set number of months exact numbers can be found in the references and you must bear in mind that it will be different if you are a direct entrant and an expedition however this is a little different in gold where you must undertake a further residential section a list of suggested activities can be found here,if you already practice a sport outside of school you re safe you will just need to get your coach teacher to confirm that you do it think about sports you have done before if you liked them why not see if there are any classes or teams in your area if there aren t you can always set one up yourself start something new do something that you might not normally get the chance to like capoeira or belly dancing it s fine as long as you get some marginal amount of exercise and you might as well have fun while you re at it the dofe authority allows all sorts of weird and wonderful sports for example underwater rugby join a class most fitness centres will have a wide range of classes that you can attend if that doesn t appeal there are also teams for more competitive people and more informal groups especially for beginners there are also things like boot camps which are a great source of exercise and are often run in places like public parks get a personal trainer it may cost more but they will know a lot about what kind of exercise is best with a personal trainer it is also more likely that you will be worked harder and hence will improve your general fitness level invest in a membership to your local gym fitness centre this may cost a small amount but will give you unlimited access to a range of fitness activities so you don t have to stick to the same activity each week go running or cycling by yourself if all else fails this will be free but make sure to get someone to witness that you ve done it find a person or organization in need of help this shouldn t be about badgering people to take you on but more about providing help where it is needed apply to a local charity shop the ubiquitous dofe volunteering choice these are a good option they could usually use some help and you can arrange your work timings and days with them more or less when you d like them however these are pretty popular and so you should probably move fast many local council s also have a team responsible for coordinating volunteers as well as youth workers that should be able to work with you to find an opportunity don t be put off by the myriad of departments on a council website ring the main switchboard number and the operator should be able to connect you to the right person talk to scout or guide groups they are often in need of help especially with their younger members however some groups require you to be a member of the scouting guiding movement and their meetings may last quite a bit longer than an hour remember that there are many different branches of these organizations which could be a better choice if you have a particular skill e g sea scouts or air scouts look for people in need of help search around in your area for people who are currently looking for some assistance some good places to offer your aid would be at a school for the disabled or an old people s home for example learn a musical instrument this is always a good skill to have and opens the doorways to things like orchestras and ensembles you don t have to have formal music lessons things like playing in a band can also count towards this learn a new language this is becoming increasingly desirable in the modern world will open doors to fantastic travel opportunities and be a lot of fun learn more about a subject there are myriad groups and this is especially important if you desire to study a mostly non curricular or obscure subject take the opportunity to do some of the odder examples allowed by the dofe authority these will likely have added cost but will be extremely interesting and amusing examples include go on a course there are many summer schools or courses which are at least 5 nights long and you can learn things at the same time too this can also be an asset to your personal statement if you do something related to your intended course of study e g medlink for medicine jact summer schools for classics etc ask your teachers for ideas they will probably have some information on some courses that could be useful for you and some teachers even teach also at these events do some volunteering there are loads of great volunteering opportunities wherein you can fulfill your requirements for the residential section and do some good at the same time you could go abroad and help with a project like building a school or look for some smaller projects again like with the elderly or the disabled you could also see if there s a school scout guide group that wants to do something like a summer camp who would appreciate your assistance research online if you don t find anything related to your academic interests or you don t have any especial academic interests search online for fun things you could do there are many many places that offer week long activity residentials e g the national trust so search around until you find something that catches your

has standard parts and knowing those parts beforehand can help you handle the meeting better of course it will have things about where your child is at right now including the ways their disability affects them it will also have goals for your kid 3 x research source there ll also be info on what services your child will get as well as how long each day your kid will be apart from nondisabled children it will also lay out whether or not your child will be included in standardized assessments the dreaded standardized tests as well as how your kid s progress will be measured gather information from those who can t be there evidence is always helpful when it comes to this type of meeting so don t be afraid to back yourself up with some help even if certain people can t be at the meeting you can still bring statements from them for instance if your child s doctor has something important to contribute you can ask them to jot something down about it for you to take review the evaluation before the meeting your child will be evaluated to determine what help they need you should be given access to this information and it can be helpful to read this ahead of time you may find that you disagree with certain parts and that s important information to bring up at the meeting be ready with goals part of the meeting will be setting goals for the year you should think about that ahead of time so you can be ready to speak up when the time comes 4 x research source think about your child s abilities what do you think they can do in the next year what would you like to see them do try to be realistic it might help to write down the goals to bring to the meeting ask for an interpreter if you don t speak english as a first language the district will usually provide an interpreter for you you must ask at least 3 days ahead of time though so don t be afraid to speak up call the school to request one get the time and date the school has to make it so you or your

with the evaluation the evaluation is the professional assessment of your child if you think something about the evaluation is wrong you have a right to speak up you may think that your kid has more ability than what was determined by the evaluation on the other hand you may think your child needs more help than what was established by the evaluation keep in mind though that school is likely to want some kind of support from you to back up your claims advocate for adjustments to the iep usually you help create the iep at the meeting sometimes though the school will have written out an iep ahead of time you may also be revising the iep from the previous year if you feel like something is wrong with it let your voice be heard you are your child s advocate 6 x trustworthy source

course you don t want to take your child kicking and screaming to the meeting if they don t want to go wait until the next year or whatever age they seem ready alternatively maybe some kids just want to listen in the meeting and not speak up discuss what s going to happen ahead of time talk to your child about why the meeting is happening if they don t know they are receiving extra help the

not discriminatory on their face the ocr still may find the school is not in compliance with federal anti discrimination laws if the rules are applied in a discriminatory manner or if the application of the rule has a discriminatory impact as part of the investigation ocr staff also may visit the school and observe teachers and school administrators as they carry out their duties review the findings of the investigation when the investigation is complete the ocr will make a determination of whether the evidence it found was sufficient to constitute a violation of federal anti discrimination law 11 x research source both you and the school will send you a letter of findings that explains the ocr s determination the letter breaks down your complaint into allegations that each cover a single fact for each listed allegation the letter will state whether the investigation has uncovered insufficient evidence to show a failure to comply with federal law or that a preponderance of the evidence shows a failure to comply with federal law keep in mind that the letter of finding you receive is only available to the parties in the investigation and is not a general policy statement it only applies to the facts alleged in your complaint negotiate a voluntary resolution agreement when the ocr determines that the school violated federal anti discrimination laws it will request that you and the school participate in voluntary negotiations to resolve your complaint 12 x research source through voluntary resolution you meet with the school and ocr officials in an attempt to negotiate a settlement to the complaint resolutions may include changes in school policies and procedures if the school refuses to participate in negotiations the ocr may begin

against the school is appropriate if the school does agree to negotiate a voluntary resolution agreement you will meet with school officials and ocr staff to resolve your complaint once an agreement is reached it is legally binding however the ocr does not monitor or enforce the school s compliance with the agreement rather if the school fails to follow the agreement it reached you must file another complaint with the doe speak out publicly regardless of the outcome of your complaint you may be able to force a change in the school s policies or administration by raising awareness of the school s discriminatory discipline in your community and among parents 13 x research source you can always start by talking to friends about the discriminatory discipline you ve witnessed if you re a parent speak to other parents with children similar to yours to find out if they ve noticed the same things you also might consider bringing up the issue of discriminatory discipline at the meeting of a parent teacher association or organization meeting talk to teachers as well and find out if any of them have noticed the same things you have and would be willing to speak out against discrimination in the application of discipline file reports with nonprofit organizations there are many nonprofit organizations that take action against discriminatory behavior and violations of civil rights in the educational setting find a local or regional office where you can report the discrimination taking place at the school 14 x research source organizations such as the american civil liberties union have chapters in each state and are dedicated to fighting discrimination and advocating for equal opportunity to education while you can take action on your own nonprofit organizations already have substantial networks and resources that they can use to fight for you and help you change discriminatory procedures in your school write letters to state and local elected officials bringing discriminatory discipline to the attention of state and local lawmakers can motivate them to pass new laws or regulations to address the issue 15 x trustworthy source kansas university center for community health and development community based research center focused on supporting public health development and education go to source you typically can find contact information for your elected representatives including school board members by visiting your state or county government s website try to keep your letter brief and focus on the facts of the situation and any efforts you ve made so far to remedy the discrimination you ve observed end your letter with a call to action if there is currently a law or rule pending you might mention that if not focus on the need for strong rules

how to create a mini makerspace,for several years the idea of the steam science technology engineering art math has been a major topic in education and business along with the creation of makerspaces what exactly is a makerspace it is a space where inventors have the material available to complete a task using innovation problem solving and shared resources 1 x research source many schools and libraries would like to include makerspaces in their buildings but are hampered by a lack of room and funds fortunately it is possible to create a space to encourage inventors of all ages and interests as thomas edison once said to invent you need a good imagination and a pile of junk 2 x research source,create a preschool drawing space ever notice how children prefer boxes and wrappers to the toys inside them you don t have to have a lot of expensive equipment to interest a young child in making things here are some ideas that will keep your preschooler engaged use a wall as a drawing area with contact paper or self adhesive whiteboard paper available online or at most craft stores and dry erase markers a wall can be a kid friendly drawing area if you want to create a permanent drawing area paint an area accessible to your child with chalkboard or dry erase paint create a playroom makerspace an existing playroom can become a makerspace with the addition of a few materials include age appropriate furniture for a small area a play table of approximately coffee table height would be the appropriate height for preschool age children consider tables with drawers or shelves for storage provide storage with easy access it is nearly impossible to prevent playrooms makerspaces from getting messy but providing floor level baskets and bins will make it easier for your preschool maker to put their things away when they are done using them you can find storage bins at your local craft store or office supply store or online by googling storage bins provide material for creating things reuse items like packing boxes construction paper and wrapping paper provide material such as crayons stickers ribbon and duct tape for decorating the kids creations always make sure kids have adequate supervision when they are using the makerspace create a makerspace for elementary school age children many people associate makerspaces with high tech equipment like 3d printers but you can create a low tech makerspace that holds the kid s interest and is more appropriate for a first or second grade student set up your furniture try to find tables with adjustable legs to accommodate children of different ages and heights if you plan to include power or hand tools use furniture that is sturdy and you won t mind being damaged yard sales can be a good source add plenty of storage space a rolling storage cart can be bought online for approximately 50 00 find a space that you won t mind getting messy a corner of a basement or rec room might work well encourage your children to help in the planning are they interested in painting or sewing bring them along when you shop for materials and furniture create a makerspace for teens and adults the maker movement has a lot in common with the diy do it yourself movement gather your tools edsurge com has a list of tools and materials to stock your makerspace ranging from items from around the house to specialty tech items 3 x research source gather your materials you don t need to spend a ton of money to obtain material for your projects you can find items at greatly reduced prices or even for free encourage input from older students when one charter school 4 x research source decided to create a makerspace for their kindergarten class they sought input from their seventh and eighth graders for ideas this provided the opportunity to learn design thinking 5 x research source give the students a task to solve the teachers asked the seventh and eighth graders to repurpose old dressers after interviewing the kindergartners they determined how best to do a redesign of the dressers teach your students how to use the necessary tools some of the dressers were falling apart and the students needed to use hammer and nails drills and circular saws to make the necessary repairs adapt the furniture to the makerspace the students determined several ways to adapt the dressers to become usable makerspaces including put the dressers on locking casters attach a pegboard for tool storage build a step stool to help students reach high tools secure a milk crate to the space for extra storage build a handle to help transport the space 6 x research source keep reviewing and improving the design as the kindergartners began using the new makerspaces it became obvious where improvements could be made for example although the design included step stools a better design would be to lower the shelves so the dressers counters could be used as work areas involve the patrons in planning ask for input from your patrons from preschool to adult and take note of comments made in passing use the materials you have available the reading pa public library has a designated area known as the teen loft when they have extra material available they place it in a designated area for teen patrons to use however they wish 7 x research source ask for donations from the public many people have cardboard boxes glass and plastic containers and other material available encourage them to bring them to the school or library instead of throwing them away start small one way to make the most use of limited space is to have a mobile makerspace while there are dedicated maker carts available 8 x research source you can use any type of cart and adapt it to your classroom or library needs apply for corporate sponsorships many corporations support education by making grants available makerspacelabs com 9 x research source has a list of corporations that provide educational grants for teachers and schools enlist the community start a fund drive for your classroom or public library use local public forums like your school district s or municipal website start a crowdfunding drive crowdfunding is a way to raise funds online through donations from a large group of people the balance small business website 10 x research source has a list of reviews of the best crowdfunding platforms to suit your

how to research a topic,with so much information potentially available at your fingertips having a research assignment can be daunting however if you approach your research methodically you ll be able to answer any research question in a thoughtful and comprehensive way develop a research question that is narrow enough to be addressed within the scope of your paper then use keywords to find sources that have the information you need once you ve found several sources you ll be ready to organize your information into a logical report that adequately answers your question 1 x research source,read through your assignment instructions carefully how much leeway you have to develop your research question depends on how tightly your assignment is structured make sure you understand what your instructor wants so you can find a topic you re interested in learning about that best suits the assignment 2 x research source if you don t understand any aspect of the assignment don t be afraid to ask your instructor directly it s better to get an explanation about something than to assume you know what it means and later find out your assumption was incorrect brainstorm some topics that interest you and fall within the assignment s parameters typically an instructor will provide a broad topic area then expect you to find a more narrow topic to research that falls within that broad area 3 x research source for example suppose your instructor assigned a research paper about a public health concern you might make a list that included such public health concerns as teenage vaping anti vaxxers and drunk driving from your list choose one area in particular that you want to look at this is where you ll start your research for the purposes of this example assume you chose to research vaping among teenagers look up general information about the topic once you ve got an idea for a more narrow topic you want to focus on do an online search to see generally what information is out there about it at this point pay attention to the amount of information available and the issues raised by some of that information 4 x research source if you re doing a general internet search on your topic and not getting back a lot of strong results there may not be enough information out there for you to research that topic this is typically rare though unless you ve started off with a topic that s too narrow for example if you want to study vaping in your high school you might not find enough sources however if you expanded your search to include all high schools in your state you might have more luck if you don t know a whole lot about your topic look for a resource that will provide a general overview so you can become more familiar with possible questions you could answer in your research paper decide on the question you want to answer through your research after you ve done a little preliminary research you ll likely have some idea of the kinds of issues that are pressing in your chosen area form a question based on one of those issues that you can answer through research 5 x research source for example if you wanted to look at teenagers and vaping you might decide to ask the question are teenagers who vape more likely to smoke than teenagers who don t how you frame your question also depends on the type of paper you re writing for example if you were writing a persuasive research essay you would need to make a statement and then back that statement up with research for example instead of asking if teenagers who vape are more likely to smoke than teenagers who don t you might say teenagers who vape are more likely to start smoking look for information about your specific question at this point you re ready to do some preliminary research based on the question you ve chosen it can help to type your exact question into the search engine then go through the results you get 6 x research source look at the number of results you get as well as the quality of the sources you might also try an academic search engine such as google scholar to see how much academic material is out there on your chosen question refine your question based on the information you find you may find that your question is too broad or too narrow based on the number of potential sources you find to adjust the scope of your question look at who when and where 7 x research source for example if you ve chosen teenagers who vape the who would be teenagers if a search of that topic yields too much information you might scale it back by looking at a specific 5 year period the when or only at teenagers in a specific state the where if you needed to broaden your question on the same topic you may decide to look at teenagers and young adults under the age of 25 not just teenagers identify the types of sources you ll likely need the types of sources you ll use for your research depend on your grade level or education level generally you can use short journal articles or webpages for a shorter paper for a longer paper you ll likely need to look at books and longer scholarly articles while the requirements differ based on your assignment and the topic you re researching you may find these guidelines helpful 8 x research source 1 to 2 page paper 2 to 3 webpages or short journal articles 3 to 5 page paper 4 to 8 journal or scholarly articles webpages or books 5 to 10 page paper 6 to 15 journal or scholarly articles webpages or books 10 to 15 page paper 12 to 20 journal or scholarly articles webpages or books use topical keywords to find your initial sources the success of your research depends on searching the right keywords especially in its initial stages brainstorm a list of keywords including synonyms 9 x research source for example if you re researching the prevalence of vaping among teenagers you might also include adolescents and youth as synonyms for teenagers along with tobacco use or e cigarettes as synonyms for vaping take advantage of academic databases available online through your school in addition to the internet evaluate potential sources using the craap method the letters stand for currency reliability authority accuracy and purpose point of view this method provides you an easy way to quickly and uniformly evaluate the quality of potential sources you find by asking specific questions about the source 10 x research source currency how recent is the information when was the source last updated reliability are there references for facts and data is the content mostly opinion authority who is the creator of the content who is the publisher are they biased in any way does the creator have academic credentials in the field accuracy has the content been peer reviewed or edited by a third party is information supported by evidence can you easily verify facts in another source purpose point of view is the content intended to teach you something or to sell you something is the information presented biased mine reference lists to find additional sources you can use when you find a good source for your topic chances are that source cites other valuable sources that you can look up the biggest benefit of this is that you don t have to do as much work evaluating the quality of these sources the author of the source that cited them has already done that for you 11 x research source if an author mentions a particular source more than once you definitely want to read that material the reference list typically contains enough information for you to find the source on your own if you find that you can t access the source for example because it s behind a paywall talk to your school or a public librarian about it they may be able to get you access take notes about each resource you find using a set of index cards enables you to place each note on a separate card which will make it easier for you to organize your notes later there are also computer apps such as evernote microsoft onenote or scrivener that will allow you to do this digitally some of these apps are free while others require you to purchase a subscription 12 x research source list the citation information for the source at the top of the card then take notes in your own words include the page numbers if applicable that you would use in your citation if you copy something directly from the source put quote marks around those words and write the page number if applicable where that quote appears you may also want to distinguish quotes even further for example by having quotes in a different color text than your own words this will help protect you against accidental plagiarism create a spreadsheet with bibliographic information for all of your sources a spreadsheet allows you to quickly organize and find the citation information for your sources as you work on your paper having this information ready allows for the least disruption of your writing process 13 x research source include columns for the full citation and in text citation for each of your sources provide a column for your notes and add them to your spreadsheet if you have direct quotes you might include a separate column for those quotes many word processing apps have citation features that will allow you to input a new source from a list so you only have to type the citation once with a spreadsheet you can simply cut and paste categorize your notes into groups of similar information as you were taking notes you likely grouped those notes by the source where you found them now look at the information covered by each source and come up with categories of information then you can start stacking or grouping note cards together that fall into the same category 14 x research source for example if you were writing a paper on teenagers and vaping you may have notes related to the age teenagers started vaping the reasons they started vaping and their exposure to tobacco or nicotine before they started vaping if you used a digital note taking app you typically would categorize your notes by adding tags to them some notes may have more than one tag depending on the information it covered order your categories in a way that answers your research question look at your categories and try to formulate a logical order that answers your questions or tells the persuasive story that you want to tell through your research you may have to rearrange them more than once to find the best fit 15 x research source for example suppose your research indicated that teenagers who vaped were more likely to switch to regular cigarettes if someone in their household smoked the category covering teenage vapers exposure to tobacco or nicotine before they started vaping would most likely be the first thing you talked about in your paper assuming you wanted to put the strongest evidence first draft a basic outline for your paper based on your order of categories now that you ve put your categories in order you re ready to create a rough outline of your paper keep in mind this may change when you start writing but for now it will give you a roadmap and help you identify any problems or weak spots in your research 16 x research source unless your instructor has specific requirements for your outline you can make it as detailed or as simple as you want some people prefer full sentences in their outlines while others have sections with just a word or two working through the outline methodically can help you identify information that you don t have yet that you need to support your thesis or answer your research question review your notes and adjust your research question as necessary as you researched you may have found that you weren t asking the right question you may also have found that there was more information available than you previously thought and you need to narrow your focus 17 x research source even at this late stage don t be afraid to change your question to more accurately frame your research because of your research you know a lot more about the topic than you did when you first wrote your question so it s natural that you would see ways to improve it search for additional sources to fill holes in your research when looking at your notes and outline you may realize that some points are more well supported than others you may also find small issues that you hadn t noticed before that need to be addressed 18 x research source for example when outlining your paper about teenagers and vaping you may realize that you don t have any information on how teenagers access e cigarettes and whether that access is legal or illegal if you re writing a paper about teenagers vaping as a public health concern this is information you would need to know it s also likely that as you formulated your outline you discovered that you didn t need some sources you previously thought would be valuable in that situation you may need to look for more sources especially if throwing out a source took you below the minimum number of sources required for your assignment,Education-and-Communications
how to conduct audience analysis,to make any type of writing as effective as possible it is important that the writer understands his or her audience what the reader wants needs knows and feels about a topic are important factors in how the work will be received and the more you know about the reader the more effective your writing can be this is true regardless of whether you are writing a speech a scientific article or instructions for someone applying for a loan or installing a piece of software these instructions will help you analyze your audience and develop a strategy to target your writing appropriately,decide who your audience is in other words who will be reading this document you probably won t be able to provide a detailed answer to this question yet that s why you re doing an audience analysis you should however be able to answer the question in general terms for example will your document be read by someone trying to install some shelves employees of a certain company computer programmers trying to work out a bug in some new software consider why this audience will be reading your document what task will it help them perform or what do they need to know decide what you need to know about your audience depending on who you re writing for there are different types of information that it will be helpful for you as you work to make your document as useful and or persuasive as possible you will almost always want to ascertain your audience s levels of knowledge about and interest in the topic 1 x research source depending on the audience the situation and the type of document you are preparing there are many other pieces of information that might be valuable such as where the audience is likely to read your document and a variety of demographic factors such as age gender education professional background cultural background and so on 2 x research source decide how to conduct your analysis your audience analysis can be formal i e using a survey or other questionnaire structured interviews etc or informal i e based on more casual conversations with members of the audience the best method will depend on the audience you are trying to reach how much information you need about them and what resources you have available for conducting your analysis 3 x research source sometimes you may be able to find information that someone else has already collected in the form of surveys or marketing research that can stand in for collecting your own data create your analytical tool your analytical tool is the instrument you ll use to gather your information e g your actual questionnaire or interview questions the content should be driven by your brainstorming in step two try to avoid creating questions that lead your participants toward a given answer even if you think it is correct for example now that we ve shown you how effective our product can be how likely are you to buy it or how do you feel about the president s oppressive tax policies avoid double barreled questions questions that ask about more than one thing at a time may confuse your participants or result in unreliable data 4 x research source for example you shouldn t ask how often do you read articles about science and share them with other people instead break this into two questions how often do you read articles about science and how often do you share articles about science with other people if you use a survey keep it as simple and short as possible 5 x research source select your sample once you ve decided which questions to ask it s time to decide who you should ask them to if you can t include everyone in the audience in your analysis try to select a group of individuals who you think are representative of the audience you hope to understand for example if you think your audience is mostly women try to select a sample that reflects that other characteristics that might be useful in selecting participants could be their occupation or employer especially if you are writing something for people in a particular field their ethnic backgrounds the city or neighborhood in which they live or their membership in a particular organization which characteristics are most important will vary based on the type of document you are producing and the audience you are hoping to reach collect your data conduct your survey interviews or conversations with potential audience members if you are using a survey you may want to let your participants remain anonymous especially if you are asking them about anything sensitive or personal this can lead to more honest responses if you are interviewing participants in person you may find it useful to ask clarifying questions or probe for more information by saying things like can you tell me more about that or tell me why you feel that way at the same time how you conduct the interviews can affect how people answer your questions so you ll need to work hard not to show your own biases or make your participants feel like they should answer in a particular way 6 x research source for interviews or informal conversations it s often a good idea to record the conversation for later reference if your participants agree to this never record anyone without their permission as this may be a violation of state law analyze your findings now it s time to have a look at the information you ve collected and see what it tells you about your audience how knowledgeable or interested are they about the topic you ll be writing about how old is the average person in your sample what proportion of them subscribe to the publication you are writing for if you need to conduct in depth statistical analyses of your data there are software programs that can help you such as stata or spss these programs are costly though and for most purposes calculating simple percentages is more than adequate common applications like excel can help you with organizing and analyzing your data putting your questions across the top row in a data sheet and then placing each participant s responses in the rows below will allow you to quickly summarize the range of responses you got for each question if your analytical tool used open ended questions i e questions that do not specify a limited range of possible answers for example how do you feel about company x you will probably want to classify people s responses into categories for example skeptical hostile uncertain or positive so that you can summarize how large numbers of your participants responded e g the majority had a negative impression of company x create an audience profile once you ve analyzed your data collect your findings into a single document that summarizes who your audience is and what their needs are putting this together will help you organize your thoughts and create a coherent picture in your mind of who your audience is 7 x research source the sample document at the top of this article is a good example of an audience profile consider your format depending on your audience some formats might be more effective than others if this decision hasn t already been made for you by your employer pick a format you think will be appropriate for your audience if your audience will be reading your document while carrying out a task a technical manual or instruction sheet made up of bullet points and possibly diagrams may be most effective 8 x research source on the other hand if you are hoping to inform professionals about new research in their field an article or newsletter format might be best 9 x research source create an outline before you actually write your document create an outline to organize and plan your content this will not only make writing easier it s also a good way to ensure that the information you have deemed most important will all be present and that it will be organized in a way that will make sense to your audience 10 x research source outlines are also a good way of developing headings for the different sections in your document which will be useful in helping readers identify the key pieces of information they are looking for 11 x research source set the tone one of the most valuable things about audience analysis is that it allows you to select a writing voice that will be compelling and effective for reaching your audience the right choice of words and sentence structure can make a big difference in getting your message across to your audience for example if your audience is highly educated and or well versed in the topic you are writing about the use of highly specific and technical vocabulary may be acceptable or even helpful if your audience is not well informed about your topic such language should be avoided likewise if your audience is likely to be reading your work while carrying out a specific task or in a work environment with many distractions the use of short simple sentences is advisable if they ll be reading your work at home and giving it their undivided attention varying sentence length and structure will make your writing more compelling and enjoyable 12 x research source address the audience s needs and objectives most importantly knowing what your audience hopes to learn from the document you are crafting will allow you to make sure that the information they need most is presented in a way that is easy for them to locate and understand 13 x research source,Education-and-Communications
how to start a revolution,to create a revolution you need to unite people around a shared purpose it s possible to start a revolution although it can take a lot of patience organization and passion it will be more likely to succeed if you don t wing it a revolution from the latin revolutio a turnaround is a significant change that usually occurs in a short period of time,find a central theme around which to organize your revolution if you re a marxist this may be a central belief that capitalism is the root of all evils because it exploits the working class you need to find such a central truth whatever the revolution you are seeking find a way in a simple sentence to articulate your cause as a theory find a common purpose and define it create a clear and eloquent message what does your revolution stand for what does it want to accomplish and why create a simple and powerful message that you can push out consistently 1 x research source 2 x research source you will want a cause that connects to people s deepest passions and their sense of right and wrong anchor this in what really matters and how it will create a better world 3 x research source identify a need for reform you can only build your case for change if you articulate why the present is broken in addition to theory you can do this by seizing on a specific need or concern that is backed up with data essentially you are trying to articulate the reasons that change is necessary perhaps you want to change a single institution like a school target a need or concern that is high profile and compelling to use the educational example this might be a high drop out rate perhaps you want to change a government if you can explain specifically how that government is letting people down or endangering the environment or something specific like that people will rally more to your cause create concrete goals it s helpful for the revolution to know what it s seeking to change legislation a system of government itself a simpler shaping of minds about a certain concept like environmentalism breaking down your goals into smaller changes can help the revolution make actual change faster for example you might wish you could eliminate poverty throughout the world but helping some local families in poverty might be a better place to start you will see effects immediately 4 x research source you will need an action plan this should be a written and or visual model that can include responsibilities activities and timelines don t just wing it sit down and plan measure progress and use data constantly come up with a plan to secure resources perhaps you will need operational support you will need people who are willing to donate money or time to the cause having a funding backer could be useful access to raw materials can also help you will need to fund basic costs that you might not think of on the front end such as postage printing permit costs and a website seek donations you need partners people with resources people intellectual financial or otherwise who can join in and assist the organization don t try to do it yourself choose a leader and symbol put a charismatic face on the revolution revolutions can take off when there is a charismatic face of the revolution to rally the masses this can be someone already known or just a person who is particularly eloquent or who has standing on the issue you need someone or something to represent your rebellion like a symbol for example katniss is the mockingjay the leader can be the person with the original idea or just a person who is courageous enough to take the heat 5 x research source choose a spokesperson who is articulate and good on camera build rapport with tv and newspaper reporters to get your message out there are some who advocate making all decisions by group and staying anonymous with no clear leadership so leaders can t be targeted or jailed by the opposition remember though that having a charismatic leader can be another strategy and if that leader is targeted and jailed it can in some circumstances rally the masses to the cause as in the case of martin luther king jr recruit activists you need the people who will organize and lead the movement these people must be committed and willing to work in the trenches and to devote their hearts and time to the cause motivate people to join because they believe in the cause give presentations at coffee houses or music stores or other places where you think receptive audiences congregate the organizational team will require people with different skills and techniques they will know how to interact with the media and how to get the masses to turn out for a protest the average people might relate more to people like them than a charismatic leader if they see other people they know or relate to joining in they will feel more comfortable doing so themselves 6 x research source you cannot create a revolution with a single person you need to remember the ground game creating a revolution is a painstaking process that requires grassroots organization build support and consensus nothing is going to happen if the only rebels are you and your buddies this is an important step and the setup for either a successful revolution or a small civilian rebellion flop build partnerships with other people and groups seek supporters for your change you will need people both inside and outside the institution or societal structure in question to have a better chance at achieving change don t succumb to the temptation of competition identify these people and then seek their support pick people who are influencers and can themselves reach more people pick a mixture of people with different strengths build alliances and link with other partners and people who are already working on the same cause or one related to it 7 x research source to create change you will need at least 15 of the population to create a shift bring new people on board your team don t turn only to the people you know find people whose skills are needed try to reach out to groups that are already organized and have membership lists and ground operations unions are an example recruit intellectuals it s easier to start a revolution if its causes are supported by intellectuals this can mean professors researchers authors artists speakers and opinion writers 8 x research source intellectuals can help build the rationale for the revolution by articulating compelling theory they can provide facts that will build the case many revolutions ignite with a deeper seminal work such as martin luther king jr s letter to birmingham king wrote this letter while in jail in response to a public statement issued by eight white southern religious leaders it became a central document of the civil rights movement that defused the opposition and rallied support the intellectuals can also help create a coherent and clear vision that will excite the masses about what the future can hold intellectuals can articulate what the new world or system will look like turn to scientists polemics matters but grounding the movement in science and data can be particularly effective consider the global warming debate and how important science is to environmental movements as they seek to make their case ground the movement s cause in scholarly research that is respected in its field including from those who are not directly involved in the movement it will be much harder for the opposition to refute the movement s arguments remember the power of art and music the rationale for a revolution can come from all artistic realms and areas of pop culture you don t only have to focus on the written word spoken word poetry music and art including public art can advance your message and cause more effectively sometimes some art can be lasting consider a mural painted in a community music has the ability to influence minds all over the world try to humanize the movement make people care by telling the stories of real people whom the masses will identify with and care about embrace all of the potentials of the new media you can also start a revolution through the quality of your own ideas the internet has given anyone the ability to publish and reach the masses create a blog install wordpress or another blogging service write a blog and push it out to the masses in it create the intellectual foundation for why change is needed and explain how change will look and what it would mean for your audience consider other formats as well you might want to create a documentary this can educate and motivate an audience don t forget the power of shorter video a you tube series could help don t have a one prong media strategy use old and new media use the written word and multimedia like video use social media and blogs but plant your message in traditional newspapers and magazines push your message out through multiple formats and mechanisms use social media to organize remember to harness the power of social media social media is a great way to get your messages in front of a lot of people you can use social media to build attendance and events and to reach a targeted audience 9 x research source remember not to only have a social media strategy revolutions are more successful when they organize both off and on the computer screen build support by handing out flyers and pamphlets by word of mouth and advertisements and through today s technology frame the debate you can do this by choosing your words carefully choose your model of morality in america this is sometimes divided into nurturant parent or strict father consider how words like freedom create emotional response 10 x research source anchor your words to people s needs and your overall mission persuade through a mixture of pathos emotional appeal logos appeal to reason and ethos ethical appeal build your case with logical reasoning and fact while adding in an emotional element 11 x research source demonstrate the popularity of the movement to the people in power legislature and military the greater the popularity among society the more the likelihood of violent repression is reduced expect that people will react different ways to change researchers have found five stages in the process of change the first phase is called uninformed optimism and it s the honeymoon phase of the project there will be energy and enthusiasm at this point however problems will then crop up and informed pessimism results some change efforts may be abandoned in order to continue with the movement you will need hopeful realism the third stage this sets in when efforts succeed even though there were some problems informed optimism is when confidence comes back because things are still progressing finally rewarding completion develops when you can show concrete results and communicate them take action this is the most important step because the revolution dies without it you must take action whether it is a nonviolent protest or a sit in or a boycott your leader must motivate the support and dutifully work day and night to improve your revolution but at some point you need to do something not just write about it or talk about it the power in place will defend itself for that is the nature of power illegitimate governments are not happy about a rebellion from their people and will do anything to crush resistance remember your goal is the heart of your operation your consensus is the mind of the revolution and the actions you and your support take are the hands of your revolution work from within gain decision making positions in key institutions some of those who have studied revolutions like saul alinsky have argued that revolutions are slow and require patience penetrate institutions that have power in society some of those can be churches unions and political parties gain influence within the decision making ranks once in power use the new platform to create change within the system 12 x research source adapt and be flexible revolutionary movements must be adaptable to shifting political circumstances resilience can be important 13 x research source find a target you will need a foil to define your movement choose a target and then personalize it then polarize it do not choose violence in one research study it was found that non violent resistance campaigns are twice as likely to succeed freeze the target by centering on the target whether it s an institution or a specific leader match your strong points against your enemy s weak points that s according to sun tzu s the art of war perhaps the opponent has a stronger military but you are cooler 14 x research source don t ever cause harm to anyone else however you can create an eloquent case for change by focusing on the words and actions of a single target institution group or person study past revolutions you can create a revolution that is modeled on some of the principles that worked before history is replete with revolutions that succeeded the american revolution the french revolution the civil rights movement revolutions often start by disorganizing the old or established organizations in society disorganize them by challenging their foundations and principles revolutions have happened throughout human history and vary widely in terms of methods duration motivating ideology and the number of participating revolutionaries their results include major changes in culture economy and socio political institutions once the old is disorganized the new is able to better organize determine your tactics remember that power is what the enemy thinks you have keep the pressure on use ridicule hold the enemy to its own stated rules switch tactics because tactics can lose effectiveness if they drag on try civil disobedience sometimes people decide that political channels are not working so they take to the streets in a show of people power for example people have protested chemical factories in china and mining issues in washington d c they have taken to the streets to protest what they see as police abuse 15 x research source you can try to work within the system but when that s not working you can work outside of it but in a visible way a hunger strike a mass protest plan the protest research the rules of public spaces pick the time wisely probably on a friday so people are available to go pick a spot that is in an area of public interest pick a local political issue to activate people and find a public space that can hold a lot of foot traffic research permit requirements and local laws and stay within them make sure decisions are made by groups and make booths or art in order to generate messages from the scene consider

how to write a paper,writing papers for school can be challenging and time consuming in this article you will learn the format of writing a successful paper and tips on what every teacher is looking for the deadline is soon let s get started,review your assignment sheet and rubric your paper needs to fulfill your teacher s requirements so make sure the topic you re planning to write about fits the assignment then check that you re writing the correct type of paper and using the proper research materials you don t want to do all of the work to write a paper and find out you did it wrong 1 x research source if you have a rubric then you know exactly what to do to earn a high grade think of your rubric as a checklist for your paper research your topic to find your thesis learn about your topic and try to form your own ideas about it based on your research take notes as you find interesting points and follow what interests you shape your notes into a thesis about the topic 2 x research source the research you find will be used as your sources so make sure they re legitimate and can be shown to your teacher utilize the internet books and various academic databases to find solid primary and secondary sources if you ve chosen a topic that isn t quite amounting up to what you thought it would it s still early pick something else that you may find easier to write about brainstorm a thesis this paper will present your ideas as you do your research what questions do you find yourself asking what patterns are you noticing what are you own reactions and observations delve into yourself to find your thesis the string that ties it all together 3 x research source a good thesis will succinctly express the main idea of your paper in one or two sentences it should also touch on all the points made in your paper explain the significance of your argument be logically sound appear at the end of the introductory paragraph here s an example in his tale the pardoner shows his hypocrisy by admitting he satisfies his own greed committing the same sin he condemns and attempting to sell his pardon s after the story conduct additional research to back up your claims in most cases your first round of research won t be enough to write a great paper you need to do specialized research to find sources that back up the claims you plan to make you ll be switching from a general search about your topic to a targeted search aimed at finding information that backs your own ideas 4 x research source choose the sources that most strongly support your ideas check that your sources are reliable by making sure they re unbiased finding the credentials of the writer and verifying that the publisher is trusted books academic journals and online databases are the best places to find good sources make an outline this should organize your thoughts and be a skeleton of your points don t worry about citing examples now simply plan out how you want your paper to flow it ll save you loads of time in the long run 5 x research source write down what points come from where finding information a second time can be like finding a needle in a haystack organize your outline to address the introduction body and conclusion bring in the reader and state your thesis in the intro support your reasoning in the body and wrap it all up at the end develop your introduction think of your paper as a sandwich the introduction is the first piece of bread in the first paragraph the reader s attention should be grabbed and your thesis made 6 x research source introduce the topic in which you will be talking about start with a relevant quotation intriguing question or by addressing the counterargument make sure that your thesis statement is clearly stated and leads into your paper the reader should have a fairly good idea by the end of this first paragraph what they are about to be a part of build the body this is the meat of the sandwich the part where the true argument and taste of your paper lies it should be three paragraphs long all addressing a different yet related point 7 x research source make sure each point is logically sound and adds weight to your thesis a topic sentence generally the first sentence but not always should clearly say what this point is then introduce your first piece of evidence followed by 1 3 sentences that connect your evidence back to your thesis explain how your evidence supports your points next introduce your next piece of evidence for that point in most cases you ll have at least 2 pieces of evidence for each point but you may have more in a longer paper follow the same format for each paragraph the spotlight should dote on each point separately allowing you time to argue in favor of it how does it relate to your thesis are you leaving anything out three paragraphs is standard for the traditional 5 paragraph paper if your paper is longer support your points as need be if your points aren t all equally strong sandwich your weakest point in the middle end with a strong conclusion this is the bottom bun the last paragraph in your paper all you need to do in this paragraph is bring your paper to a close restate what you have already mentioned in the opening statement and leave the reader feeling satisfied end on a memorable thought quotation or call to action or if your paper calls for it allude to the consequences of your thesis if left unaddressed what should the reader walk away thinking or wanting to do know what your teaching is looking for they ve probably said it in class 5 different times but if anything is foggy ask do they want your paper in mla or apa format are they a stickler for third person what s their take on page numbers and margins how many sources do they require are there sources that are unacceptable check for grammar and content errors you ve been going over this paper for so long it may be difficult to truly see it in all its glory take a break for a bit go back and read it twice it s a good idea to get someone else to go over it for you your writing may be clear to you but difficult to understand for someone else what s more have them go over punctuation and grammar as well you may have read it so many times you stopped noticing use transitions an easy way to make your paper flow is to incorporate transitions even within points show the logical connections between your ideas transitions make it clear that one paragraph flows into the other what s more your topic sentences should ease into the evidence effortlessly 8 x trustworthy source

dozens to choose from but here is a short list in the first place comparatively likewise coupled with in addition in the light of by the same token etc write in the third person present tense though

or plagiarize the first will result in a fail and the second will result in a fail whatever you do avoid these two things a paper that summarizes is not your own work your teacher is looking for something coming from you some idea that would not be found in another reader because of that you cannot within reason be wrong stand by your opinion and use it to create a unique thesis all your own if you plagiarize your teacher will know each person writes differently and your paper will be interrupted by the change of style if you re thinking about plagiarizing the entire thing know that all teachers have access to sources that identify this in addition to being able to recognize when it s not your style of writing,Education-and-Communications
how to write a case study,there are many different kinds of case studies there are also various uses for writing case studies from academic research purposes to provision of corporate proof points there are approximately four types of case studies illustrative descriptive of events exploratory investigative cumulative collective information comparisons and critical examine particular subject with cause and effect outcomes 1 x research source after becoming familiar with the different types and styles of case study instructions and how each applies to your purposes there are some steps that make writing flow smoothly and ensure the development and delivery of a uniform case study that can be used to prove a point or illustrate accomplishments,determine which case study type design or style is most suitable to your intended audience corporations may choose illustrative case study method to show what has been done for a client schools educators and students may select cumulative or critical case study method and legal teams may demonstrate exploratory investigative case study method as a way to provide factual evidence whatever case study method you re employing your purpose is to thoroughly analyze a situation or case which could reveal factors or information otherwise ignored or unknown these can be written about companies whole countries or even individuals what s more these can be written on more abstract things like programs or practices really if you can dream it you can write a case study about it 2 x research source determine the topic of your case study once you ve picked your angle you need to determine what your research will be about and where it will take place your case site what have you talked about in class have you caught yourself coming up with questions during your reading start your research at the library and or on the internet to begin delving into a specific problem once you ve narrowed down your search to a specific problem find as much about it as you can from a variety of different sources look up information in books journals dvds websites magazines newspapers etc as you go through each one take adequate notes so you can find the info later on 2 x research source search for case studies that have been published on the same or similar subject matter talk to your professors go to the library surf the web until your bum falls asleep you don t want to replicate the research that has already been done find out what has been written before and read the important articles about your case s situation when you do this you may find there is an existing problem that needs solution or you may find that you have to come up with an interesting idea that might or might not work in your case situation review sample case studies that are similar in style and scope to get an idea of composition and format too select participants that you will interview for inclusion in your case study experts in a particular field of study or customers that have implemented a tool or service that is the subject of the study will provide the best information find knowledgeable people to interview they don t necessarily have to be on your site but they must be actively or in the past directly involved determine whether you will interview an individual or group of individuals to serve as examples in your case study it may be beneficial for participants to gather as a group and provide insight collectively if the study focuses on personal subject matter or medical issues it may be better to conduct personal interviews gather as much information as possible about your subjects to ensure that you develop interviews and activities that will result in obtaining the most advantageous information to your study draft a list of interview questions and decide upon how you will conduct your study this could be via in person group interviews and activities personal interviews or phone interviews sometimes email is an option when you are interviewing people ask them questions that will help you understand their opinions i e how do you feel about the situation what can you tell me about how the site or the situation developed what do you think should be different if anything you also need to ask questions that will give you facts that might not be available from an article make your work different and purposeful set up interviews with subject matter experts account managers in a corporation clients and customers using applicable tools and services etc make sure all your informants are aware of what you re doing they need to be fully informed and signing waivers in certain cases and your questions need to be appropriate and not controversial conduct interviews ask the same or similar questions of all subjects involved to ensure that you get different perspectives on a similar subject or service when you ask a question that doesn t let someone answer with a yes or a no you usually get more information what you are trying to do is get the person to tell you whatever it is that he or she knows and thinks even though you don t always know just what that is going to be before you ask the question keep your questions open ended request data and materials from subjects as applicable to add credibility to your findings and future presentations of your case study clients can provide statistics about usage of a new tool or product and participants can provide photos and quotes that show evidence of findings that may support the case collect and analyze all applicable data including documents archival records observations and artifacts organize all of your data in the same place to ensure easy access to information and materials while writing the case study you can t include it all so you need to think about how to sort through it take out the excess and arrange it so that the situation at the case site will be understandable to your readers before you can do this you have to put all the information together where you can see it and analyze what is going on formulate the problem in one or two sentences as you go through your data think about how you can put what you ve found into a thesis like statement what patterns have your subjects brought to light this will allow you to concentrate on what material is the most important you re bound to receive information from participants that should be included but solely on the periphery organize your material to mirror this develop and write your case study using the data collected throughout the research interviewing and analysis processes include at least four sections in your case study an introduction background information explaining why the case study was created presentation of findings and a conclusion which clearly presents all of the data and references the introduction should very clearly set the stage in a detective story the crime happens right at the beginning and the detective has to put together the information to solve it for the rest of the story in a case you can start by raising a question 3 x research source you could quote someone you interviewed make sure to include background information on your study site why your interviewees are a good sample and what makes your problem pressing to give your audience a panoramic view of the issue 4 x research source after you ve clearly stated the problem at hand of course 2 x research source include photos or a video if it would benefit your work to be persuasive and personalized after the reader has all the knowledge needed to understand the problem present your data include customer quotes and data percentages awards and findings if possible to add a personal touch and more credibility to the case presented describe for the reader what you learned in your interviews about the problem at this site how it developed what solutions have already been proposed and or tried and feelings and thoughts of those working or visiting there you may have to do calculations or extra research yourself to back up any claims at the end of your analysis you should offer possible solutions but don t worry about solving the case itself you may find referring to some interviewees statements will do the alluding for you let the reader leave with a full grasp of the problem but trying to come up with their own desire to change it 2 x research source feel free to leave the reader with a question forcing them to think for themselves if you have written a good case they will have enough information to understand the situation and have a lively class discussion add references and appendices if any just like you would in any other paper reference your sources that s why you got credible ones in the first place and if you have any information that relates to the study but would have interrupted the flow of the body include it now you may have terms that would be hard for other cultures to understand if this is the case include it in the appendix or in a note for the instructor make additions and deletions as your work is forming you ll notice that it may morph into an object you didn t otherwise expect if it does so make additions and deletions as needed you may find that information you once thought pertinent is no longer or vice versa go over your study section by section but also as a whole each data point needs to fit into both it s place and the entirety of the work if you can t find an appropriate place for something stick it in the appendix edit and proofread your work now that your paper is formulated look for minute revisions as always correct any grammar spelling and punctuation errors but also keep an eye out for flow and transition is everything placed and worded as efficiently as possible have someone else proofread too your mind may have become oblivious to the errors it has seen 100 times another set of eyes may also notice content that has been left open ended or is otherwise

how to put a stamp on an envelope,though it may seem like a simple procedure putting a stamp on an envelope correctly will ensure your letter reaches its destination the size of your envelope and the weight of your letter will affect how much postage or how many stamps you put on the envelope the standard rules for postage vary by country and may fluctuate over time so always consult your local post office for current postage rates,check the size of your envelope this should be marked on the packet of envelopes or on the envelope itself size 14 envelopes measure 5 x 11 5 and are considered the standard size they will be rectangular in shape and will often be sold in packages at your local post office you can also mail a letter in an envelope that is smaller than a size 14 such as a size 10 envelope 4 125 x 9 5 with a regular stamp if possible fold your letter so it fits in a standard rectangular envelope as this may cut down on the price of postage envelopes larger than size 14 are considered large envelopes or flats and will be more expensive to mail card sized envelopes made for small greeting cards or wedding invitations will also likely have additional postage fees this is because pieces of mail that have an odd shape or are square shaped and made of rigid card can jam mail processing machines and need to be processed separately weigh your letter you can do this at the post office or on a small office scale the weight and size of your letter plus the envelope will affect the price of postage or how much you will pay for a stamp often the heavier the letter is the higher the price of postage will be letters in a standard envelope that weigh less than 13 ounces can be sent via first class mail at one flat rate letters in a standard envelope that weigh more than 13 ounces will be upgraded to priority class mail and the price for postage will be more than the flat rate 1 x research source decide if you want to send the letter by first class priority or standard mail there are three basic levels of mail according to the us post office first class mail is often what is used to send letter size pieces that are rigid and square to send a letter first class it must weigh no more than 13 ounces the price for sending first class mail is the same regardless of the distance the letter is traveling the arrival time for first class mail is two to three days for destinations within the u s sending mail first class is ideal for a single letter as all you need is a standard stamp and access to a post box 2 x research source priority mail is ideal if you want your letter to get to the addressee by the following business day to send a letter by priority mail it must weigh no more than 70 pounds at the post office you can add on extra services to your priority mail item such as usps tracking and registered mail especially if your letter contains legal or sensitive information that must reach its destination the price of priority mail postage is based on the distance the mail must travel the further the distance the more you will pay for postage this is broken down by nine zones for example zone 1 is local or the area close to you and zone 9 is the furthest distance away from your location standard mail is used for larger quantities of mail at least 200 pieces or 50 pounds of mail at one time envelopes must weight less than 16 ounces large envelopes also called flats cost more than letters people use standard mail to send flyers advertising documents newsletters catalogs and bulletins you can only send domestic mail by standard mail and you cannot send one single envelope through standard mail buy postage based on the size weight and class for the letter if you need the letter to reach its destination fast send it by priority mail if you do not need the letter to get there any sooner than three to five business days send it by first class mail if you aren t sure what class is right for your letter ask the attendant at your local post office 3 x research source to send a letter that weighs less than 13 ounces in a standard envelope to a domestic address by first class mail it will cost 0 49 to send a letter that weighs less than 13 ounces in a standard envelope to a zone 1 local address by priority mail it will cost 5 75 the price of postage will go up based on the zone or area you are sending the letter to attach the stamp to the envelope if you are using sticker stamps peel the paper off the back of the stamp if you are using lickable stamps lick the back of the stamp put the stamp on the top right corner of the envelope this will allow the postage scanning equipment to read the envelope and process it 4 x research source make sure the address of the sender and the address of the receiver are not covered or obscured by the stamp place the letter in the mail do this by dropping the letter off at your local post office or by putting it in a post box in your area 5 x research source you can also put the letter in your home mailbox for your mailman to pick up any letters that weigh more than 13 ounces must be mailed at your local post office 6 x research source purchase postage based on the size weight and class for the letter send the letter by priority mail if it weighs more than 13 ounces and the letter needs to get to its destination by the following business day send the letter by first class mail if it weighs less than 13 ounces and the letter can get to its destination within three to five business days if you aren t sure what class is right for your letter ask the

how to write a progress report,progress reports are an important part of project management whether it s your dissertation or a project at work you ll need to use these to keep your supervisors your colleagues or your clients updated about the project you re working on you ll be focusing on what you ve accomplished and what still needs to be done,figure out what your purpose is for the proposal there are a variety of different reasons someone asks you to write a progress report obviously for any of them it s to show what kind of progress you ve achieved on a specific project however there are some different types of proposals that you ll need to consider 1 x research source progress report for a research program or project is going to be slightly different than for a project at work in this case you are more likely to need to cite information and are less likely to need to consider things like cost although not always a work report for a client is going to read somewhat differently than for a superior at work you ll need to consider why you re writing this report for them consider your audience when you ve sorted out the purpose of writing your progress report you need to consider the kinds of things that your audience is going to need to know in the report while all progress reports have general things they tend to include you ll need consider the specifics how are your readers connected to the project how will the outcome of the project affect them the connection and how they re affected is going to be different for your superior than for the client for example consider what decision your readers are going to need to make after reading the progress report what support money time are they investing for example consider the information your reader is going to need to know to oversee and participate in the project effectively what technical aspects of the project will they need to know are they comfortable with technical jargon decide on the best way to communicate with your audience a progress report isn t only a written document that you send to your superior or your professor it can take a number of forms depending on what is needed 2 x research source a progress report could be a brief oral report at weekly or monthly staff meetings it could be periodic emails to colleagues it could be formal or informal memos to supervisors it can also be formal reports for clients or government agencies check with your supervisor unless you ve written this specific type of progress report before in which case why are you on here you ll want to get as much guidance from your superiors there may be a specific format that your company uses in which case you ll want to be sure you follow the rules for that consider your tone not all progress reports need to be formal in fact internal reports for colleagues or supervisors often tend to be more informal in tone this is why it s so important to check with your supervisor for what they are likely looking for when it comes to information for a client or government agency or thesis review board you err on the side of formality no matter the formality or informality of your tone you want it to be clear focused and honest decide how you want to present your material by the time you start writing your report you ll already have figured out what the tone needs to be and the point of the report now you need to decide the best way or ways in which to present that information 3 x research source you might choose to do a bulleted list it s a very clear way to present the material and it s easy to skim and still get the needed information however it can be a slightly less formal way of writing a progress report so it might be better to use it for memos to supervisors and emails to colleagues you may also consider adding in graphs or tables this might be especially good if you re writing a progress report for a project in which you re trying to get funding or show why you deserve the funding you ve been given consider using subsections to write a successful progress report you want it to be as clear as possible splitting your report into subsections is a great way to cluster all relevant material together 4 x research source adding subheadings to your can make this even clearer because it lets your readers or audience know what to expect in each subsection if there is material that they are particularly interested in they ll be able to jump right to that part write the heading this typically goes across the top of the paper if you re using a page format again it will depend on what your company or university prefers so make sure you check in with them the heading should include the date when the report was submitted the name and the position of the recipient the writer s name and position and the subject of the report write the introductory section the introductory section goes below the heading it can often be set apart from the rest of the material through italics it gives a brief overview of the project and summarizes its status you will be establishing what progress has been made and whether certain goals have been achieved 5 x research source make sure to include the purpose of the report introduce the project remind that this is an update on the progress of the project do the body of the proposal the body of proposal whether it s broken into sections and subsections is basically just a more detailed version of the introduction consider the information you ve put into the introduction and make sure to expand on that information specify tasks that have been accomplished since the last report and what tasks are ongoing discuss problems that you ve encountered issues that need to be addressed and potential solutions for those problems and issues address changes that have happened and why they needed to be made you can also include things like personnel changes difficulty in obtaining material what cost overruns you may have encountered any delays or problems with technology or security address what is next for your project while this is still basically part of the body of the report you want to make sure that your audience understand where you re going with the project make sure that you state what problems might affect the deadline for completion the budget or the management structure you really do want to make sure say whether the deadline for the project has changed or not avoid sugarcoating any problems for your audience but don t alarm them unnecessarily or promise anything you can t deliver add in total hours worked you will need to show how much work you and your team if you have one have put into the project this will show your audience whether it s your supervisor your clients or a government agency who might give you money that you ve been working hard make sure you stay on topic as long as you stick the basic information outlined above you should be fine you really want to avoid wandering off into other areas only marginally related to the project interesting though they may be for example if your project is about reigniting a local nonprofit arts organization it might be tempting to go off into a discussion of the deplorable state of arts funding but it won t really help detail how your project is coming along keep it simple the point of a progress report is to get across the progress you re making without overwhelming your audience with words and ideas all you need to focus on are how a particular project is coming what still needs to be worked on and what changes made need to be made depending on who you re writing the report for you might be cut down to a specific page limit a good rule of thumb is to keep it as short as possible while making sure that you fit in the appropriate information try to avoid being too vague you need to make sure that you give specific details on where you re at in your project for example you would want to avoid saying something like we re making good progress on getting our arts funding and instead say with the two 5 000 grants from these different foundations we are just 2 000 short of our 12 000 goal cut down on expressive wording again you want your report to be clear and concise you don t want to overwhelm your audience with wording that doesn t add anything to the report for example phrases like complete catastrophe or giddy success are too emotional and too vague to be of use to clients or supervisors 6 x research source cite your sources any information you use that comes from an outside source any graphs or data needs to be properly cited you can add an additional sources cited page to your progress report,Education-and-Communications
how to communicate well with people from other cultures,to build good relationships with people from other cultures it is essential to learn how to communicate with them verbally and non verbally you can make things easier by also learning about their culture and practicing tolerance armed with the knowledge of how to communicate effectively you can learn from people from other cultures and share yours with them,learn about the culture beforehand 1 x research source a little knowledge can go a long way if you have time before embarking on a trip or meeting with someone from another culture try to take time to learn the basic do s and dont s of that culture you can find information on this from internet sources such as those provided by the national center for cultural competence 2 x research source expect differences different cultures will speak at different volumes be more or less direct in showing emotion may or may not expect to engage in small talk and exhibit other dissimilarities in communication 3 x research source when communicating with people from other cultures be prepared to encounter such differences including ones that you were not aware of understand hierarchies when communicating with a different culture there may be unwritten rules about social hierarchy that you are not used to 4 x research source 5 x research source for instance you may come from a culture where men and women are expected to communicate equally with each other but may have to interact with someone from a culture where men may do more talking in mixed company similarly you may be communicating with someone who expects that a younger person should let an older person do most of the talking while you expect people across age groups to communicate equally be upfront about difficulties in communication if you could not understand someone or think that he or she did not understand you say something about it avoid being rude or offensive but patiently explain the problem it s usually better to be upfront than to let a problem in communication go undressed since there may otherwise be bigger problems later if you think you did not understand what someone meant try saying something like i m not sure i understood you could we go over that again if you think that someone did not understand you try saying something like let s review things to make sure we re all on the same page you can also make sure to let the person know to ask questions be respectful and tolerant each culture has its own set of dominant values beliefs and prejudices signs of these may emerge when communicating with people from other cultures basic communication however it is not the time to judge people based on these differences instead respect them for what they are and tolerate them 6 x research source you may even learn something new even if cultural differences come up explicitly in conversation be tolerant and open minded instead of argumentative for instance if you are american and someone comments on americans tendency to be work focused say something like yes it s true that many americans take work seriously and there are a lot of reasons for that why don t you tell me some more about how your culture thinks about work be patient communicating with people from other cultures can be enlightening and rewarding but also have its difficulties expect that not everything will come out quite right or be fully understood be patient with others and ask them to be patient with you speak clearly and slowly if necessary refrain from shouting unnecessarily or treat others as though they do not understand 7 x research source raising your voice does not make you easier to understand and can be seen as rude likewise even if there are difficulties in communicating with people from other cultures do not treat other people as though they are unintelligent communication difficulties arise from cultural differences not because of matters of intelligence be proper be polite and use formal modes of address until it is made clear that you don t need to such as a business contact telling you to use first names 8 x research source depending on the cultures that are interacting this may include addressing others by first and last name by last name alone with a title such as mr or sir using formal pronouns if they exist in the language used for communicating brush up on your foreign language skills if you will be communicating with people who speak a different language try to learn a few basic phrases beforehand your situation may not require you or permit you to become fluent in a foreign language but you can still try to learn some practice the basics including hello please thank you how are you etc carry a phrase book or electronic device that can help you find phrases you need and don t know be patient when others are trying to use your language try to use the dominant language if you are in the linguistic minority if you are communicating with people who speak a different language try to use their language at first or as much as you can even if you can t say much more than hello and how are you in their language the gesture is usually appreciated avoid slang and profanity this is important unless you are absolutely sure how it is used in another culture using non standard or obscene language improperly can make you hard to understand and may be perceived as very offensive since a language s slang and profanity are complex and highly dependent on context it is best to avoid them altogether unless you are absolutely sure you know to use them properly use open handed gestures in some cultures pointing with an index finger giving the ok sign and other common gestures can be seen as offensive 9 x research source since you may not know which gestures could be mistaken in this way stick to open handed gestures 10 x research source for instance try using your whole hand if you need to point to something assume a formal posture at first 11 x research source keep your feet on the floor sit up straight don t use your arms too expressively and otherwise keep your posture more or less conservative this is because certain postures can be seen as offensive to others for instance showing your foot in some cultures is seen as a rude gesture so you would not want to cross your legs in a way that your sole sticks out 12 x research source if it becomes clear that a less formal posture is acceptable you can follow suit understand rules regarding touching some cultures may expect more physical contact between people when communicating than other cultures do for example some cultures may shake or touch hands more willingly than others 13 x research source don t take it as offensive if another culture is more or less physical than you are used to when communicating the exception is if you think you are being violated or abused if you are uncomfortable let others know it s a good rule of thumb to be conservative with the way you touch people from other cultures when communicating with them however if they appear to use more physical contact follow suit if you are comfortable doing so know how to make or avoid eye contact in some cultures looking another person in the eye when you speak is seen as a sign of honesty and interest in other cultures however it may be seen as disrespectful confrontational or a sign of sexual interest conversely some cultures think than not looking a superior person in the eye when communicating is a sign of respect 14 x research source expect different facial expressions 15 x research source it is common for different cultures to use facial expressions differently for instance americans may smile frequently while other cultures may see excessive smiling as a sign of shallowness when communicating with people from other cultures you may notice that they are more expressive with their face to show happiness sadness frustration etc than you are used to or you may notice that they do not show much expression at all much communication is non verbal no matter what the culture however you can focus on the content of what is being said and ask questions to clarify if you need to for instance if someone reacts to something you say with an unexpected smile or laughter you may need to say actually i m being i m serious respect the amount of personal space the situation requires some cultures may require more personal space than others if you are communicating with people from another culture and you find they get closer to you or farther away from you than you are used to it s not necessarily the case that they are invading your space or trying to avoid you just try to follow their cues regarding personal space and communicate as best you can,Education-and-Communications
how to write a conclusion,writing the introduction and body of a paper is a big accomplishment but you still need to write your conclusion writing a conclusion can feel difficult but it s easier if you plan ahead first format your conclusion by revisiting your thesis summarizing your arguments and making a final statement then re read and revise your conclusion to make it effective,begin a conclusion by revisiting your thesis to show how you proved it explain how you demonstrated your thesis as well as what the reader should take from your paper by reminding your reader of the ideas you expressed in your thesis you can more effectively show how your points and evidence support your thesis 1 x research source let s say your thesis reads allowing students to visit the library during lunch improves campus life and supports academic achievement because it encourages reading allows students to start assignments early and provides a refuge for students who eat alone you might restate it as evidence shows students who have access to their school s library during lunch check out more books and are more likely to complete their homework additionally students aren t forced to eat alone summarize your argument in 1 2 sentences these sentences should pull together all of your points and evidence for your reader don t simply list your reasons or the evidence you provided instead explain how your evidence works together to support your thesis 2 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source you might write according to data students checked out more books when they were allowed to visit their library during lunch used that time to do research and ask for help with homework and reported feeling less alone at lunch time this shows that opening up the library during lunch can improve student life and academic performance if you re writing an argument essay address the opposing argument as well you might write although administrators worry that students will walk the halls instead of going to the library schools that allow students into the library during lunch reported less behavioral issues during lunch than schools that don t allow students in the library data show that students were spending that time checking out more books and working on homework assignments 3 x trustworthy source purdue online writing lab trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines go to source end your paper with a statement that makes your reader think consider how you want your reader to feel after they finish reading your paper this is the feeling you want to create in your reader when they read the last sentence of your paper here are some techniques you can use to create this feeling 4 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source call your reader to action for example by working with school administrators greenlawn isd can increase academic achievement by letting students use the library during lunch end with a warning you might write if students aren t allowed to use the library during lunch they are missing out on a valuable learning opportunity they ll never get back evoke an image write next year students at greenlawn could be gathered around a table in the library reading or broadening their minds compare your topic to something universal to help your reader relate you might write everyone knows how stressful it is to have a planner full of assignments so having extra time to work on them during lunch would be a great relief to many students show why the issue is significant write giving students more time to spend in the library will help them become more comfortable spending time there which also helps the library s mission predict what would happen if your ideas are implemented say next year students at greenlawn could increase their academic achievements but results will only happen if they can use the library during lunch end with a compelling quote for instance as author roald dahl once said if you are going to get anywhere in life you have to read a lot of books talk to your instructor if you have questions about the assignment you might be writing a conclusion for a unique type of paper such as a post experiment report if this is the case your instructor or assignment sheet might provide you with different formatting instructions always follow the instructions provided by your instructor so you can receive full credit for your work 5 x research source you could also ask your instructor if you can see an example of a well written conclusion to give you an idea about what they expect you to write avoid using introductory phrases like in conclusion it s tempting to start off your conclusion this way but it s a big turn off to readers when you use cliches like this you don t need to use any special words to begin your conclusion if you want to use an introductory phrase use a stronger one like based on the evidence or ultimately you might also begin your first sentence with a word like although while or since 6 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source additionally avoid to conclude in summary or in closing model your conclusion based on your introduction your conclusion will be different from your introduction but they will share certain features for example you ll end your introduction with your thesis statement and begin your conclusion by revisiting that thesis additionally your conclusion can refer back to the ideas and information you presented in your introduction which brings your paper full circle 7 x research source for example you may have opened your introduction with an anecdote quote or image bring it back up in your conclusion similarly if you opened with a rhetorical question you might offer a potential answer in your conclusion include all of your points in your summary rather than focusing on one you might make the common mistake of only discussing your most persuasive point or the last point you made however this can undermine your argument as a whole it s better to provide an overview of how your points come together to support your ideas than to give your reader a thorough review of your strongest point 8 x research source for example you wouldn t want to end your essay about allowing students to use the library during lunch by stating as the evidence shows using the library at lunch is a great way to improve student performance because they are more likely to do their homework on a survey students reported using the library to do research ask homework questions and finish their assignments early this leaves out your points about students reading more and having a place to spend their lunch period if they don t like eating in the cafeteria make sure you don t introduce any new information conclusions are tricky because you don t want to simply repeat yourself but you also shouldn t say anything new read over what you ve written to check that you haven t introduced a new point added new evidence or tacked on extra information everything in your conclusion must be discussed in the introduction or body of your paper 9 x trustworthy source purdue online writing lab trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines go to source if you have introduced something you think is really important for your paper go back through the body paragraphs and look for somewhere to add it it s better to leave it out of the paper than to include it in the conclusion proofread and revise your conclusion before turning in your paper set aside your paper for at least a few hours then re read what you ve written look for typos misspelled words incorrectly used words and other errors additionally check that what you ve written makes sense and accurately reflects your paper 10 x research source if something doesn t make sense or your conclusion seems incomplete revise your conclusion so that your ideas are clear it s helpful to read your entire paper as a whole to make sure it all comes together,Education-and-Communications

how to do a case study,many fields require their own form of case study but they are most widely used in academic and business contexts an academic case study focuses on an individual or a small group producing a detailed but non generalized report based on months of research in the business world marketing case studies describe a success story presented to promote a company,define the subject of study a case study focuses on a single individual a small group of people or occasionally a single event you ll be conducting qualitative research to find specific details and descriptions of how your subject is affected for example a medical case study might study how a single patient is affected by an injury a psychology case study might study a small group of people in an experimental form of therapy case studies are not designed for large group studies or statistical analysis decide between prospective and retrospective research prospective case studies perform new studies of their own involving individuals or small groups retrospective case studies examine a small number of past cases related to the subject of study and do not require new involvement with the subject of these cases a case study may or may not include both types of research narrow down your research goal this may be given to you in advance by a professor or employer or you may develop it on your own here are the main types of case studies organized by goal 1 x research source illustrative case studies describe an unfamiliar situation in order to help people understand it for instance a case study of a person with depression designed to help communicate the subjective experience of depression to therapist trainees exploratory case studies are preliminary projects to help guide a future larger scale project they aim to identify research questions and possible research approaches for example a case study of three school tutoring programs would describe the pros and cons of each approach and give tentative recommendations on how a new tutoring program could be organized critical instance case studies focus on a unique cases without a generalized purpose examples include a descriptive study of a patient with a rare condition or a study of a specific case to determine whether a broadly applied universal theory is actually applicable or useful in all cases apply for ethical approval almost all case studies are required by law to obtain ethical approval before they can begin contact your institution or department and propose your case study to the people in charge of ethics oversight you may be asked to prove that the case study does no harm to its participants follow this step even if you are conducting a retrospective case study in some cases publishing a new interpretation can cause harm to the participants in the original study plan for a long term study most academic case studies last at least 3 6 months and many of them continue for years you may be limited by your research funding or the length of your degree program but you should allow a few weeks to conduct the study at the very least design your research strategy in detail create an outline describing how you will gather data and answer your research questions the exact approach is up to you but these tips may help create four or five bullet points that you intend to answer if possible in the study consider perspectives on approaching the question and the related bullet points choose at least two and preferably more of these data sources report collection internet research library research interviewing research subjects interviewing experts other fieldwork and mapping concepts or typologies design interview questions that will lead to in depth answers and continued conversations related to your research goals recruit participants if necessary you may have a specific individual in mind or you may need to recruit people from a broader pool who satisfy your research criteria make your research methods and time frame extremely clear to the potential participants unclear communication could be a breach of ethics or could cause a participant to walk out partway through the study wasting a great deal of time since you aren t conducting a statistical analysis you do not need to recruit a diverse cross section of society you should be aware of any biases in your small sample and make them clear in your report but they do not invalidate your research perform background research if studying people research information in their past that may be relevant possibly including medical history family history or history of an organization a good background knowledge of the research topic and similar case studies could help guide your own research as well especially if you are writing a critical interest case study any case study but especially case studies with a retrospective component will benefit from basic academic research strategies learn how to conduct obtrusive observation in a case study involving human participants ethics guidelines do not typically allow you to spy on the participants you must practice obtrusive observation where the participants are aware of your presence unlike a quantitative study you may talk with the participants make them feel comfortable and include yourself in activities some researchers do attempt to maintain a distance but be aware that your presence will affect the behavior of the participants regardless of the relationship you form with them establishing trust with participants can result in less inhibited behavior observing people in their home workplaces or other natural environments may be more effective than bringing them to a laboratory or office having subjects fill out a questionnaire is a common example of obtrusive research subjects know they are being studied so their behavior will change but this is a quick and sometimes the only way to gain certain information take notes extensive notes during observation will be vital when you are compiling your final report in some case studies it may be appropriate to ask the participant to record experiences in a diary conduct interviews depending on the total length of your case study you might hold an interview weekly once every month or two or just once or twice a year begin with the interview questions you prepared in the planning phase then iterate to dig deeper into the topic 2 x research source describe experience ask the participant what it s like to go through the experience you re studying or be a part of the system you re studying describe meaning ask the participant what the experience means to them or what life lessons they take from it ask what mental and emotional associations they have with the subject of your study whether it s a medical condition an event or another topic focus in later interviews prepare questions that fill gaps in your knowledge or that are particularly relevant to the development of your research questions and theories over the course of the study stay rigorous a case study may feel less data driven than a medical trial or a scientific experiment but attention to rigor and valid methodology remains vital if you find yourself drawn to studying a participant on one extreme end of the spectrum set aside time to observe a more typical participant as well 3 x research source when reviewing your notes question your chain of logic and discard possible conclusions that do not have detailed observation backing them up any sources you cite should be thoroughly checked for reliability collect all of your data and analyze it after reading and referring back to your original bullet points you may find that the data reacts in a surprising manner you need to pull your information together and focus it before writing case studies especially if your research was performed in intervals across months or years if you are working with more than one person you will want to assign sections for completion together to make sure your case study will flow for example one person may be in charge of making charts of the data you gathered while other people will each write an analysis of one of your bullet points you are trying to answer write your final case study report based on the research questions you designed and the type of case study you conducted this may be a descriptive report an analytic argument grounded in a specific case or a suggested direction for further research or projects include your most relevant observations and interviews in the case study itself and consider attaching additional data such as full interviews as an appendix for readers to refer to if writing a case study for a non academic audience consider using a narrative form describing the events that occurred during your case study in chronological order minimize your use of jargon ask permission from a client a marketing case study describes a success story between a business and a client ideally the client has recently interacted with your business and is enthusiastic about contributing a positive message choose a client close to your target audience if possible 4 x research source request high level involvement from the client s side for best results 5 x research source even if the client only wants to vet the materials you send them make sure the person involved is high up in the organization and knowledgeable about the company client relationship outline the story a typical marketing case study begins by describing the client s problems and background it then rapidly moves on to describe how your company strategically approached these problems and succeeded in fixing them to a high standard finish by describing how you can apply similar solutions across the industry the entire case study should divide into about three to five sections 6 x research source collaboration with the client is especially helpful here so you make sure to include the points that left the most impact and biggest impression if your target audience wouldn t immediately identify with your client s problem start with a more general intro describing that type of problem in the industry 7 x research source keep the study readable and powerful use bold text and headers to divide the case study into easy to read sections start each section with short action sentences and strong verbs 8 x research source include actual numbers use numeric examples that demonstrate how effective your solutions were make this as clear as possible using actual numbers instead of or in addition to percentages for example an hr department could show impressive retention numbers following a process change while a marketing team could demonstrate past sales boosts from its service charts and graphs can be great visual tools but label these with large letters that make the positive meaning obvious to people who aren t used to reading raw data 9 x research source solicit quotes or write them yourself you ll definitely want to quote positive recommendations from your client often however the person writing these will not have a marketing background ask the client whether you can write the statements for them although of course the client will sign off on these before publication 10 x research source these are typically brief quotes just one or two sentences long describing your service in a positive light add images include photos and other images to make your case study more attractive one tactic that can work well is to solicit photographs from the client an amateur digital photograph of the smiling client team can add a genuine touch 11 x research source spread the word make your marketing case study widely available try using amazon web services microsoft s business hub or drupal 12 x research source send copies of the study to the client you collaborated with as well along with a certificate thanking them for their involvement,Education-and-Communications
how to improve math skills,math can be a difficult subject particularly if you don t have the right skills in place but once you know how to approach it strategically you ll likely find it less frustrating and have much higher chances of success this article details how to evaluate break down and successfully complete math tasks and avoid getting stuck or overwhelmed,play math games math games are good tools for honing your math skills and are designed to let you have fun while doing it 1 x expert source daron cam academic tutor expert interview 29 may 2020 some recommended online math games that are in line with the new common core standards include dragonbox 5 which lets you gradually build your algebra skills until you re able to master more and more advanced equations 2 x research source prodigy a game targeted at elementary school students that integrates math practice into a role playing game that allows players to use math to make their way through an appealing fantasy world 3 x research source many other productive games are available online and as apps so do a little looking around and find those best suited to your needs and goals make math part of your life incorporate math equations into your daily routine to help keep your skills sharp and to help you recognize the many ways that math exists all around you 4 x research source take the time to apply math in common situations for example if say a sweater that s regularly 38 is on sale for 30 off what is the sale price or if you need to double a recipe that calls for 3 4 cup of flour how much flour will you need also take the opportunity to put your math skills to work in new and different situations outside your normal routine for example if you plan to hike a new trail that s 7 miles long and it takes you 20 minutes to walk a mile how long should you plan for your hike to take or if you need to drive 13 miles to pick up your friend at 1 30 and the average speed limit there is 45 mph 72 km h what time will you need to leave to arrive on time to get your friend learn about the big picture it s easy to become frustrated with math when all you re doing is memorizing a formula that at base means nothing to you but if you work to truly understand the principles behind the formula your understanding of math can become deeper and more productive 5 x expert source daron cam academic tutor expert interview 29 may 2020 start by doing some research say you re learning the pythagorean theorem who was pythagoras anyway what does he have to do with triangles how did he discover the theorem that was named after him and why does anybody care having a sense of the development and broader implications of a math concept can turn it from something you simply have to memorize into something you genuinely understand and can take an interest in translate the math principle into everyday language staying with the pythagorean theorem you know that the basic definition of the pythagorean theorem is a2 b2 c2 but what does that translate to in everyday language try to figure it out translating it might result for example in this the square of the longest side of a triangle c2 is the same as or equal to the squares of the other two sides a2 b2 added together translating the principle into everyday non intimidating language can help you more easily understand remember and apply that principle explore with that new principle in the pythagorean theorem example try applying the theorem to other shapes than triangles can it be translated and applied to other shapes like rectangles hexagons squares etc why or why not understanding why a principle specifically applies to some instances and not others will help you better integrate and apply that principle as you go forward set up a well organized binder or notebook designate a separate binder or notebook specifically for math class one binder or notebook per class if you re taking multiple math classes set up a section for in class notes a section for reading notes and a section for homework schedule study time set aside time in your schedule for math homework and study otherwise you may be tempted to procrastinate find yourself getting behind or end up studying at inopportune times like when you re tired or rushed make time each day to work on math even if you don t have a homework assignment every day set aside at least 15 minutes to spend working on sample problems and reviewing your notes studying every day will help cement your math knowledge in place and make it easier to access when you need it at the university level you can plan to need approximately 2 4 hours of studying per week for each hour of class instruction remember that studying math unlike some other subjects is about doing math so your study practice time is the most important to your success read ahead read ahead in the book to the chapter that will be covered in the next class knowing the main idea and general precepts of the chapter before going to class will help you better understand and keep up with the material in class review notes before class read back through the notes from the previous class before your next class so you ll be up to date and prepared for the new material 6 x research source reading your previous notes will help you make necessary connections between the old and new material and give you a more solid foundation on which to build new skills go to class and get there on time it should be obvious but it s hard to do well in a course if you don t show up to learn the material try to sit near the front and center of the classroom it will be easier to see and hear and harder to get distracted develop good note taking skills 7 x expert source daron cam academic tutor expert interview 29 may 2020 though it may seem like all you need to take notes is to write down what the instructor says successful note taking has as much to do with how you write them as what you write in them if the material covered in the class is closely related to the material covered in the textbook you can use what s called the 2 3 3 2 technique make a two inch column down the left side of the page for recall clues make a three inch column down the center of the page for lecture notes make a three inch column down the right side of the page for text notes and make a two inch horizontal space at the bottom of the page for your own observations and hints 8 x research source if the material covered in class is not closely related to that covered in the textbook use two different sheets of paper one for class notes and one for reading notes and use what s called the 2 5 1 technique for each make a two inch column down the left side of the page for recall clues make a five inch column down the middle of the page for lecture notes or reading notes and make an inch column down the right side of the page for your own observations and hints 9 x research source your recall clues should be key words or phrases that label the kind of information in each part of your notes these should be cues rather than extensive or repetitive notes so that you can easily glance through your notes and associate them with the relevant concepts ask questions 10 x expert source daron cam academic tutor expert interview 29 may 2020 don t be afraid to ask questions when you have them if you re intimidated by the idea of asking questions during the instructor s lecture write down your questions and speak to the instructor after class or during in class work time make studying math a priority set aside time to work on math at the same time and in the same place everyday doing so will help you avoid procrastinating and make it easier to get into math mode rather than sitting and staring blankly at the math book for 10 minutes after putting in your study time reward yourself by doing something you enjoy it will motivate you to get through your math work and help you associate it with something pleasurable take a break every hour don t try to slog through four unbroken hours of math problems you won t be able to maintain necessary focus and you ll quickly tire yourself out 11 x research source instead take a quick break to stand up stretch get a drink or use the bathroom every hour create good study habits your study habits have a huge influence on your success in math and it s not just about the quantity of study time it s about the quality work with a tutor or study partner having someone to whom you can address questions and who can help point out mistakes is often crucial to effective learning if you encounter questions neither you nor your partner can answer write them down and bring them to the instructor make note cards write out important concepts and formulas on note cards so that you can easily refer to them while doing problems and use them for study guides before exams study in a quiet place distractions whether aural or visual will detract both from your ability to pay attention and to retain information study when you re alert and rested don t try to force yourself to study late at night or when you re sleep deprived you won t be able to concentrate sufficiently which leads to unwitting mistakes and frustration read purposefully when sitting down to read a math section in the textbook read strategically 12 x research source first gather an overview read the title and headings then read the introductory remarks and summary paragraphs to give yourself a global view of the topic look for main ideas next look over the section to gather the main ideas look for and read bolded or italicized words bulleted lists pictures and tables read the full section next read the section in full from beginning to end this should move comparatively quickly because you already have an idea of the point and main ideas of the section read with a pencil in hand write down and complete each sample problem given this will help you actively absorb what s being demonstrated and help you recognize problem concepts early on set the section aside and write down the main idea and key ideas recall tends to fade immediately after reading so taking the time to recall what you ve just read after reading will give you a significant memory advantage make connections think about how the new material you ve learned relates to and builds on what you ve previously learned making these connections will help you better understand and integrate the new material review finally after reading reflecting on and completing the new material you ll need to return to it as time goes on and you get closer to taking a test or exam master one concept before moving on to the next in math each topic builds upon the next so much like reading it s difficult if not impossible to make forward progress if you haven t mastered all of the necessary steps if you re struggling with a particular idea or concept don t skip it and move ahead instead seek help from the instructor or a tutor until you ve mastered the idea 13 x expert source daron cam academic tutor expert interview 29 may 2020 do problems neatly and completely avoid trying to solve math problems in your head instead write out each step of the solution without skipping steps if you don t write out each step as you go you may miscalculate without realizing and be unable to retrace your steps when trying to fix and learn from your mistake don t do math problems in pen and work out problems vertically and neatly with only one step per each line 14 x research source not only will working neatly make it easier for you to systematically solve a problem and avoid mistakes but many teachers also grade math exercises based on the completeness of the steps to the solution not just the solution itself have a plan to tackle each problem it can be easy to freeze up when confronted with a math problem to solve but having a basic strategy of attack can help get you through

understanding of three basic rhetorical concepts ethos pathos and logos you will need to be aware of these concepts as you write your paper and demonstrate your knowledge of them through your writing here s what you need to know about ethos pathos and logos ethos refers to a writer s credibility or trustworthiness to convince your readers that your argument is valid you need to convince them that you are trustworthy you can accomplish this goal by presenting yourself as confident fair and approachable you can achieve these objectives by avoiding wishy washy statements presenting information in an unbiased manner and identifying common ground between yourself and your readers including the ones that may disagree with you you can also show your authority another aspect of ethos by demonstrating that you ve done thorough research on the topic pathos refers to your use of emotional appeals emotional appeals have a place in argumentative writing but overuse of them may lead a reader to reject your argument make sure that your use of emotional appeals is minimal and appropriate some ways that you can incorporate pathos into your paper without turning off your readers includes using descriptive language that evokes the desired reaction positive or negative to your subject especially when you use other people s language such as quotes to do so which avoids damaging your ethos with overly emotional language you can also invoke pathos by providing relevant examples that evoke an emotional response in your readers and using figurative language such as metaphors to help your readers understand and sympathize with your point of view logos refers to your use of logic reasoning and sequencing this means setting up your argument in a way that uses logic to achieve your desired endpoint or reaction often through inductive and deductive reasoning for example you can appeal to your readers desire for logic by organizing your examples in a way that shows your argument in the best light and is easy to follow such as chronologically by cause and effect or by problem and solution develop your tentative thesis once you have developed your ideas for your argumentative essay you should be ready to write a tentative thesis statement 7 x research source a tentative thesis statement can help you to move forward with your ideas while reminding yourself that you are open to changes to the thesis statement in other words the tentative thesis statement is not set in stone effective thesis statements let readers know what the main focus of a paper is going to be for an argumentative essay the thesis should state an arguable claim a thesis should not be more than one sentence in length 8 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source place your thesis statement at the end of your first paragraph unless your instructor tells you to place it elsewhere the end of the first paragraph is the traditional place to provide your thesis in an academic essay make sure your thesis is arguable your thesis should express a clear position on your topic that can be supported using evidence from your sources do not state facts or matters of taste for example something like george washington was the first president of the united states would not be a good thesis because it states a fact likewise die hard is a great movie would not work because it expresses a matter of taste 9 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source consider whether your thesis statement is arguable before you move forward for example an arguable thesis statement might be something like the drinking age should be reduced to 18 in the united states this statement is arguable because it presents a position that others might debate by saying the drinking age should not be reduced to 18 in the us or others might argue that the drinking age should be abolished altogether or even raised there are many possibilities for a counter argument which makes this topic arguable make sure your thesis provides enough detail in addition to having a thesis that is arguable you should also include some details about why you hold the position in other words you should avoid simply saying that something is bad and should be changed and provide a bit of detail about why it is bad and should be changed 10 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source what is wrong with the current drinking age who would benefit if it was changed for example a detailed thesis statement might be something like because youth are more drawn to drinking as a way to rebel lowering the drinking age to 18 in the united states would help to reduce binge drinking among teenagers and college students this thesis still provides a position that could be debated but it also explains the reasoning behind the position providing this detail gives readers a good sense of what the rest of the paper will discuss your thesis should tell your reader why your argument matters and for whom develop a rough outline based on your research notes writing an outline before you begin drafting your argumentative essay will help you to organize your information more effectively you can make your outline as detailed or as scant as you want just keep in mind that the more detail you include in your outline the more material you will have ready to put into your paper 11 x research source organize your outline by essay part and then break those parts into subsections for example part 1 might be your introduction which could then be broken into three sub parts a opening sentence b context background information c thesis statement generate key terms and phrases to help you with your research before you head to the library or log on to the library s webpage it is important to take a moment to develop some key terms and phrases that will make the process of finding relevant sources a bit easier you can use these key terms and phrases to search your library s databases for relevant books articles and other sources as you develop key terms keep your topic and your position in mind for example some relevant key terms and phrases for a paper on lowering the drinking age to 18 might be drinking underage minors binge rebellion drinking age binge drinking culture countries with low drinking age drinking and rebellion etc find appropriate secondary sources for your argumentative essay in order to find support for your argument you will need to gather a variety of sources see your assignment guidelines or ask your instructor if you have questions about what types of sources are appropriate for your assignment books articles from scholarly journals magazine articles newspaper articles and trustworthy websites are some sources that you might consider using use your library s databases rather than a general internet search university libraries subscribe to many databases such as ebsco and jstor these databases provide you with free access to articles and other resources that you cannot usually gain access to by using a search engine schedule an appointment with a librarian at your school s library if you are not sure about how to use the library databases if your university doesn t subscribe to any databases use google scholar evaluate your sources to determine their credibility use trustworthy sources only in your argumentative essay otherwise you will damage your own credibility as an author using the library s databases will also help to ensure that you are getting plenty of trustworthy sources for your paper there are several things that you will need to consider in order to determine whether or not a source is trustworthy 12 x research source author s credentials choose sources that include an author s name and that provide credentials for that author the credentials should indicate something about why this person is qualified to speak as an authority on the subject for example an article about a medical condition will be more trustworthy if the author is a medical doctor if you find a source where no author is listed or the author does not have any credentials then this source may not be trustworthy 13 x research source citations think about whether or not this author has adequately researched the topic check the author s bibliography or works cited page if the author has provided few or no sources then this source may not be trustworthy 14 x research source bias think about whether or not this author has presented an objective well reasoned account of the topic how often does the tone indicate a strong preference for one side of the argument how often does the argument dismiss or disregard the opposition s concerns or valid arguments if these are regular occurrences in the source then it may not be a good choice 15 x research source publication date think about whether or not this source presents the most up to date information on the subject noting the publication date is especially important for scientific subjects since new technologies and techniques have made some earlier findings irrelevant 16 x research source information provided in the source if you are still questioning the trustworthiness of this source cross check some of the information provided against a trustworthy source if the information that this author presents contradicts one of your trustworthy sources then it might not be a good source to use in your paper 17 x research source read your research once you have gathered all of your sources you will need to read them make sure that you read your sources very carefully and that you stay focused on your topic as you read read the sources multiple times if necessary and make sure that you fully understand what each source is about you should be able to summarize the source in your own words and generate a response to the source to be certain that you understand your sources and that you are capable of responding to each of them try writing a paragraph summary and response after you finish each one some people find keeping notecards on their sources to be a helpful way of organizing their ideas about each one 18 x research source misunderstanding and misrepresenting your sources can damage your credibility as an author and also have a negative effect on your grade give yourself plenty of time to read your sources and understand what they are saying take notes while you read your sources highlight and underline significant passages so that you can easily come back to them as you read you should also pull any significant information from your sources by jotting the information down in a notebook indicate when you have quoted a source word for word in your notes by putting it into quotation marks and including information about the source such as the author s name article or book title and page number 19 x research source be careful to properly cite your sources when taking notes even accidental plagiarism may result in a failing grade on a paper begin your essay with an engaging sentence that gets right into your topic your introduction should immediately begin discussing your topic think about what you will discuss in your essay to help you determine what you should include in your introduction keep in mind that your introduction should identify the main idea of your argumentative essay and act as a preview to your essay 20 x research source for example an argumentative essay about lowering the drinking age might begin with something like binge drinking culture is killing teens in the united states but it hasn t always been this way this sentence offers a compelling statement and it also acts as a launch pad for you to provide some background on your topic provide background information to help guide your readers providing adequate background information or context will help to guide your readers through your essay think about what your readers will need to know in order to understand the rest of your essay and provide this information in your first paragraph this information will vary depending on your argument topic 21 x research source for example if you are arguing that lowering the drinking age would help to counter binge drinking among teens and young adults your introduction should talk about the damage that is being done by binge drinking tell your readers about this problem in more detail so that they will begin to see why something needs to change keep in mind that your background information in the first paragraph should lead up to your thesis statement explain everything the reader needs to know to understand what your topic is about then narrow it down until you reach the topic itself provide your thesis statement at the end of your first paragraph after you have given your readers some information on the topic and captured their interest you should provide your thesis providing your thesis at the end of your first paragraph will help to guide your readers through the rest of your essay make sure that you state your thesis is a very direct manner so there is no mistaking that this is your position for example a thesis statement for a paper on lowering the drinking age might look something like because the current drinking age of 21 in the united states does more harm than good by proliferating binge drinking culture among teens the drinking age should be lowered to 18 this thesis provides a straightforward position and reason for that position that readers can easily identify as the author s main argument in your thesis you should also address how you ll support your argument and why your argument matters use your body paragraphs to discuss specific parts of your argument rather than trying to talk about multiple aspects of your argument in a single paragraph make sure that each body paragraph focuses on a single aspect of your text your discussion of each of these aspects should contribute to proving your thesis for each body paragraph you should provide a claim at the beginning of the paragraph and support your claim with at least one example from one of your sources for example one of your body paragraphs might begin with something like teens are more likely to engage in binge drinking in the united states than in countries where the drinking age is lower or non existent you might then follow up this claim with evidence from your sources for example you could provide statistics on teen drinking in other countries where the drinking age is lower or you could summarize an interview with an authority of the subject or cite an article that explains the psychological basis of this phenomenon whatever source s you choose make sure that they are relevant that they offer convincing support for your claim develop a conclusion for your essay concluding an essay is the hardest part of writing for many people but it may make more sense if you understand the purpose of the conclusion your conclusion should emphasize what you have attempted to convince your readers about your topic and either frame or reframe the stakes of your argument in other words it should offer a final statement that touches on the major points that you have made in your essay before you write your conclusion spend some time reflecting on what you have written so far and try to determine the best way to end your essay there are several good options for ending an argumentative essay that might help you decide how to format your conclusion for example you might rephrase your thesis it is often helpful to remind your readers of the initial argument but don t simply restate your thesis if you do this rephrase it so that it sounds different but has the same meaning summarize some of the most important evidence you have offered in your essay and say remind readers of how that evidence has contributed to supporting your thesis synthesize what you have discussed put everything together for your readers and explain what other lessons might be gained from your argument how might this discussion change the way others view your subject explain why your topic matters help your readers to see why this topic deserve their attention how does this topic affect your readers what are the broader implications of this topic why does your topic matter return to your opening discussion if you offered an anecdote or a quote early in your paper it might be helpful to revisit that opening discussion and explore how the information you have gathered implicates that discussion 22 x research source make sure that you have cited all of your sources before you finish working on your essay you will need to make sure that you have cited all of your sources using the proper format not citing your sources using in text citations or a works cited page may be considered plagiarism by your professor and lead to failure of the assignment or even the course 23 x research source ask your teacher what documentation style he or she prefers that you use if it is not mentioned in the assignment guidelines visit your school s writing center for additional help with your works cited page and in text citations put aside your paper for a few days before revising by taking a break after you have finished drafting your paper you will give your brain a rest when you revisit the draft you will have a fresh perspective it is important to begin writing a paper far enough ahead of time to allow yourself a few days or even a week to revise before it is due if you do not allow yourself this extra time you will be more prone to making simple mistakes and your grade may suffer as a result 24 x research source give yourself plenty of time to revise revision is just as important if not more important than the drafting phase of writing a paper therefore you will need to give yourself time to do a thorough revision of your paper plan to finish writing your draft at least a few days before the final version is due giving yourself plenty of time can help you avoid simple mistakes like typos and punctuation errors as well as major problems such as poor logic or faulty arguments consider your paper from multiple angles as your revise as you revise your paper you should consider multiple aspects of your writing to make sure that your readers will be able to understand what you have written consider the following questions as you revise what is your main point how might you clarify your main point who is your audience have you considered their needs and expectations what is your purpose have you accomplished your purpose with this paper how effective is your evidence how might your strengthen your evidence does every part of your paper relate back to your thesis how might you improve these connections is anything confusing about your language or organization how might your clarify your language or organization have you made any errors with grammar punctuation or spelling how can you correct these errors what might someone who disagrees with you say about your paper how can you address these opposing arguments in your paper 25 x research source proofread a printed version of your final draft read your paper out loud to make sure that it is polished and ready for your teacher to read it use your final read through as a chance to weed out any typos grammatical errors wordy or incomplete sentences and other minor mistakes that may have a negative effect on your grade highlight or

note if you re looking for how to get your voice back after you ve lost it see how to recover your voice after losing it,talk talk talk the most straightforward way to lose your voice is simply to use your voice box until it can t be used any more vocal activities like talking shouting singing etc require the vocal cords of the larynx to vibrate smoothly with overuse these cords can become inflamed interfering with your ability to do these things try talking constantly at as loud of a volume as is reasonable for wherever you are with persistence your voice should eventually begin to fatigue the more you talk the better if you re looking for opportunities to talk loudly and at great length try signing up for a public speaking class or simply holding conversations in a crowded bar or club sing singing can put serious demands on the vocal cords singing at a high volume or in a very low or high register even more so these dangers are amplified if you re not a trained or experienced singer so for a sure fire way to ruin your voice try singing at full volume in a vocal register that s difficult for you obviously you ll want to make it a point to avoid performing warm up exercises before you sing if you re embarrassed to sing loudly try singing in the car with all of the doors closed and the windows rolled up other motorists will assume you re just singing along to the radio cough though it s not uncommon for people with colds to cough until they lose their voice you don t necessarily have to have a cold to cough any kind of repeated coughing will irritate your larynx and eventually cause inflammation that can lead to losing your voice try combining your coughs with one of the other methods in this article for maximum effect as with shouting and singing excessive coughing in the long term can cause lasting pain and damage to the throat keep your mouth open as discussed above a dry throat is a throat that s easy to wear out to speed up the process of losing your voice allow your mouth and throat to dry out by keeping your mouth open throughout the day this will work especially well if you live in a dry climate if you re worried about how you ll look after adopting a slack jawed look try sleeping with your mouth open instead so that no one will see you don t drink water well lubricated vocal cords are the enemy of anyone who s aiming to lose his or her voice in fact people who speak or sing in a professional capacity often keep a glass of water onstage to protect their vocal cords if you re trying to lose your voice do the opposite don t ease your worn out vocal cords with a refreshing sip of water after you ve been talking yelling or singing be reasonable when it comes to this rule don t avoid any source of moisture to the point that you become dehydrated if you re looking for a water alternative that will wear your throat out further try a drink that s acidic or contains dairy see below for more info consume acidic foods and or dairy certain types of food and drink especially foods that are very acidic lemon vinegar etc and dairy products cause most peoples throats to produce phlegm while phlegm won t irritate your vocal cords on its own it does promote coughing which can so if you re looking to lose your voice try consuming these types of food and drink in conjunction with one of the other methods in this article drink very cold water some people find that very cold drinks can have a similar phlegm producing effect to dairy and acidic foods and drinks try drinking an ice cold glass of water to test its effects on your throat if you find that you produce lots of phlegm after a cold drink you may want to use this method to motivate yourself to cough yell the harder you work your vocal cords the quicker you ll wear them out yelling and screaming strains your vocal cords much more than ordinary talking and should lead to a hoarse or lost voice in a fraction of the time for maximum results try yelling as loudly as you possibly can keep in mind however that yelling like this can be quite painful and may even lead to lasting damage if you re worried about bothering people with your yelling try attending an event where people are encouraged to yell like a sporting event or rock concert give yourself a cold often when someone loses his or her voice it s as a result of a recent cold if you re really serious about losing your throat consider putting yourself in situations where you re likely to catch a cold for instance you may want to spend time around friends with colds and get less sleep than you re used to obviously however giving yourself a cold on purpose can result in many unpleasant side effects including fever nausea aches and general malaise so stay far away from cold viruses unless you re really serious about losing your voice it may go without saying but to be perfectly clear it s never a good idea to knowingly expose yourself to serious diseases use common sense aggravate your allergies allergies are known to cause throat irritation and hoarseness under certain circumstances 1 x research source if you have a history of mild allergies and have gotten sore throats from your allergies in the past you may want to expose yourself to allergens to help you lose your voice for instance if you have seasonal allergies triggered by pollen in addition to using one of the methods above you may want to go for a walk in the park and smell some flowers if you have a serious allergy don t flirt with danger by triggering an allergic reaction simply to lose your voice severe allergy attacks can be fatal don t give your voice a chance to rest with time the body will heal most throat irritation on its own if you want to lose your voice don t let this happen the less you allow your larynx to rest the quicker you ll be able to lose your voice push through the fatigue keep in mind however that you put your voice at risk by doing so wearing your voice out especially doing so over and over again over a long period of time can cause permanent vocal damage for example many once powerful singers find themselves with diminished abilities after years of vocal

how to deliver effective presentations,delivering presentations is an everyday art form that anyone can master to capture your audience s attention present your information with ease and confidence act as if you are in a conversation with your audience and they will pay attention to you to get this level of fluency write an engaging narrative use more visuals than text in your slides and practice practice practice,give it the bar test the bar test ensures that your idea is clear and your storytelling is effective before you write your presentation make notes sketching out your message think of it as a story with a beginning middle and end then ask a colleague or friend who knows nothing about your project to listen to your summary 1 x research source deliver your summary to them in friendly direct language as if you were telling the story to a friend in a bar in fact you can tell the story to a friend in a bar however telling a colleague over coffee can work just as well get them to tell you what their takeaway was if they can summarize your message accurately that s a good sign practice your speech in front of a colleague while you re still developing it find a friend colleague or mentor who you trust to give you useful feedback rather than waiting until your presentation is finished deliver it to them while it s still a draft that way they can give you tips not just on your delivery but on the organization of your content as well 2 x research source ask them to be your coach give them your presentation once or twice and let them ask you questions and give feedback ask them to point out moments that are dull or confusing prepare for nerves it s important to rehearse in front of people because it will make you less nervous when the time comes if you tend to get nervous when you give presentations you can go further during your rehearsals in order to reduce your nerves 3 x research source write down what you re afraid of what exactly worries you when you give a speech looking foolish being asked a hard question write down your exact fears and then consider them each individually think about what you will do in each situation for instance if your fear is i ll forget what i m saying you can prepare a plan like if i forget what i m saying i ll pause scan my notes and find the next important point i need to make catch your negative thoughts and calm them if you think i m going to get nervous and sweaty replace it with i have important information to deliver and everyone is going to pay attention to that time yourself carefully you don t want to go over your time frame and get cut off or wear on the patience of your audience time your rehearsals especially those you give in front of others to see that you are staying within the time you have give yourself extra time if you plan to take questions or if you anticipate lots of digressions practice repeatedly try practicing in front of your dog your mirror or your family practice speaking with an engaging tone gesture and emote as if you were addressing your audience know your presentation backward and forward 4 x research source this doesn t mean sticking to a strict script every time instead when you rehearse improvise freely deliver your main points but include quips and anecdotes that occur to you as you go you ll remember the best ones when you actually deliver the presentation fake confidence it s totally fine to feel nervous but you don t have to act that way the more confident you act the more confident you will feel this doesn t mean that you need to act arrogant try to calm yourself and remind yourself that what you re doing isn t unusual rather it s necessary interesting and ordinary remind yourself that your audience likely can t see your nerves 5 x research source take a deep breath and exhale before you go on stage show your emotion smile raise your eyebrows and otherwise tell your story through feelings as well as facts show your audience your own passion for the topic say everything as if you find it interesting and expect them to be interested by it as well your enthusiasm will be infectious 6 x research source speak to your audience the more directly you address your audience the more engaged they will feel be relaxed and conversational rather than rattling off your points deliver them to the audience as if you are certain they will be interesting look directly into the faces of the people you are addressing 7 x research source if there are too many people to really see faces just look boldly into the crowd mind your body language stand up straight and face the audience completely keep your head up and your shoulders back and relaxed don t twist any part of your body shoulders hips away from the audience move your hands as you speak don t wave them as this will make you look nervous instead try calmly gesturing with your palm out when you make a point if you describe a shape draw it in the air with your hands think of your presentation as a story as you write instead of organizing your presentation by topics and subtopics organize it along a story arc start by setting the stage then pull your audience into a tale with an exciting climax it may help to start your presentation with a question or a dilemma so they feel involved from the start 8 x research source have a clear through line that runs through all parts of your presentation leading to your main point include stories that put your listeners into a situation get their energy with tactile details sound sight smell taste touch and descriptions

how to give a presentation,giving a presentation terrifies most of us especially when talking before a crowd of people about an unfamiliar topic never fear there are ways to make a good presentation the more presentations you do the easier they will become,focus your presentation having a long rambling presentation that is hard to follow is not going to win you any audience interest you need to make sure that your presentation is clear and focused and that any asides you throw into it are there to back up the main point 1 x research source it s best to have 1 main thesis statement or overarching theme and 3 main points that back up or flesh out your main theme any more than that and your audience is going to start losing interest this means that any facts and information that are a part of your presentation should back up these 3 main points and overarching theme for example if you re giving a presentation about 17th century alchemy bringing up the history of alchemy is fine and probably necessary but don t mire your audience in its history instead of focusing alchemy in the 17th century your 3 points could be something like alchemy in public opinion famous 17th century alchemists and the legacy of 17th century alchemy less is more you don t want to overwhelm your audience with information and important points even if they re interested in your topic they ll starting spacing out and then you ve lost them you need to stick to your 3 points and overall point and you need to make sure that you only use the information that you need to support and clarify those points pick your very best supporting facts information or quotes for your presentation don t bury your audience in information decide whether to use media or not it isn t always necessary to use a powerpoint or visual representation especially if you re already an engaging speaker and have interesting subject matter in fact a lot of times using visual media simply distracts from the focal point that is the presentation make sure you re using media to enhance your presentation and not to drown it out the presentation is key anything else is just accessorizing for example to get back to 17th century alchemy to back up your information about alchemy in the public opinion you might want to show images from public pamphlets about the dangers of alchemy and see what people of the time period had to say about it and see what the more famous alchemists had to say about it also you want to make sure that you pick a medium that you are comfortable in and thorough in knowledge if you don t know a thing about powerpoint maybe consider writing your main points on a white board or passing out handouts with your main points and evidence on them practice this is one that for some reason lack of time perhaps people neglect to do and it is absolutely key to giving a good presentation running through the presentation before the actual event gives you time work out any kinks or problems with your notes and with your technology and makes the presentation itself go more smoothly a good tip is to film yourself or audiotape of yourself giving your practice presentation so you can see what distracting verbal and physical tics you have so that you can work on eliminating them before the presentation itself verbs tics would be things like um and uh and using like inappropriately physical tics are things like shifting your weight from foot to foot or messing with your hair just remember that rehearsals usually run about 20 shorter than your actual presentation so take that into account if you re running on a time limit visualize success it may seem like a silly thing to do but visualizing a successful presentation can actually help you achieve a successful presentation you ll be more inclined towards success if you ve been prepping your brain for it so beforehand sit somewhere quietly for a few minutes and picture the presentation going well 2 x research source dress appropriately you want to dress for success wearing nicer clothes can help get you into the mindset of giving a good presentation you also want to be comfortable however so you should try to find a reasonable medium between dressing super snazzy and dressing comfortably for example if you aren t comfortable wearing heels don t wear them just for the presentation you ll be distracted by your discomfort and that will come across in the presentation there are plenty of good shoe choices that have no or a low heel clean nice slacks or a skirt and nice button down shirt in neutral colors are always good choices for presentation wear you also don t particularly want your clothing choice to distract from the presentation so perhaps avoid that brilliant hot pink shirt deal with the jitters pretty much everyone gets nervous about presenting even when it isn t in front of a bunch of people that s okay all you have to do is mask the fact that you re nervous since you won t be able to avoid the jitters themselves 3 x research source before the presentation clench and unclench your hands several times to deal with the adrenaline and then take 3 deep slow breaths call up a smile even if you feel like hurling you can trick your brain into thinking that you re less anxious than you actually are and you ll also be able to hide your nervousness from your audience engage the audience one way to make your presentation memorable and interesting is to interact with your audience don t act like there s a wall between you and your audience engage them in the material talk directly to them not at them or at the back wall but to your audience make eye contact with your audience don t stare at one particular person but section up the room and make eye contact with someone in each section on a rotational basis ask questions of your audience and take questions during your presentation this will make it more of a conversation and therefore more interesting tell an amusing anecdote to illustrate your point from the above examples about 17th century alchemy you could find an amusing alchemical anecdote from the time period or you could talk about your own forays into alchemy give an engaging performance giving an engaging performance isn t the exact same thing as engaging your audience although hopefully your performance will engage your audience it simply means that you make the performance itself interesting and dynamic 4 x research source move around but make your movements deliberate don t nervously shift your feet in fact it s a good idea to imagine that your feet are nailed to the floor except for those times you deliberately choose to move use your vocal inflections to create a more dynamic presentation vary your voice as you re talking nobody ever wants to sit there and listen to someone drone on and on in dull monotone no matter how interesting the material think professor binns from harry potter that s what you don t want try to create a balance between rehearsed and spontaneous spontaneous on the spot movement and asides can be great as long as you are really comfortable otherwise they can sidetrack your presentation and make it rambling mess around with spontaneous and rehearsed when you re practicing and you ll get a feel for it treat your presentation as a story to get your audience s interest you ll need to connect them with the material on an emotional level and the best way to do that is to think of your presentation like a story you re telling 5 x trustworthy source harvard business review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source quickly introduce your topic and don t assume that your audience is familiar with all the terms especially if your topic is one that isn t widely known figuring out why you want or have to give this presentation will help you work with an overarching story theme maybe you want to pass the class maybe you re convincing people to give you money or join you in a philanthropic endeavor or act for a social or political reason channel that desire into your presentation you re answering the question of why they would want to pass you or why they would want to fund you that s the story you re telling talk more slowly one of the most frequent things that people do to sabotage their own presentation is talking way too quickly and so many people make this mistake they get nervous and they whip through their presentation leaving the audience gasping at the tidal wave of information don t do this have water with you and take a sip when you feel you re going too fast if you have a friend in the class or meeting arrange with them beforehand that they will let you know with a signal whether you re talking too quickly look over their way occasionally and check your progress if you find that you re running out of time and you haven t finished simply drop or summarize your leftover material acknowledge the leftover material as something that can be discussed later or in the q a have a killer closing the beginning and the closing of a presentation are the parts that people tend to remember so you want to make sure that you end with a punch to the gut figuratively speaking don t hit your audience you ll need to reiterate those 3 most important points and make sure the listener knows why they should care about your topic make it clear what the listeners now know and why it is important that they have this new information conclude with examples or stories about your main point and take home message you might want a slide which summarizes your presentation for example you might conclude with a story about the nature of alchemy in the modern era perhaps in a film to show its malleable nature,Education-and-Communications

bicycle or an electric vehicle to get around you can also use solar power to heat your home instead of things like natural gas which put a strain on the environment eating local food and using local products will also cut down on global fossil fuel usage conserve as much energy as you can producing energy is very taxing on the planet often requiring the burning of gases or the production of nuclear energy any energy you don t use can then be used for more important things and less power will need to be produced overall 5 x trustworthy source u s department of energy official site for the

caught up in working to improve the globe as a whole that we forget there are lots of things that we can do every day at home that have a positive impact too one of the best things you can do easily and every day is to treat others how you want to be treated do something nice for someone as often as you can this can be small things like making someone a birthday present or big things like driving someone around until they get their car fixed when we work together everything runs more smoothly and we re better able to further invest those gains in benefiting the rest of the globe set a good example set a good example for your friends and family members and educate them on the issues so that they can make good decisions too help them to understand why these things are important so that they re also motivated to change their lives by changing a few minds you can double triple or even more greatly increase your positive impact on the world get a job almost any job that you get can have a positive impact on your community you ll be providing a service to people who want it and adding to the economy in your immediate area improving the lot of everyone around you it will also give you money that you can use to donate to charity or fund small business loans be positive when we re surrounded by people who are negative and mean it makes us sad and pessimistic making it much harder

situations and working hard to fix problems you can positively impact the people you come into contact with be helpful to everyone we have lots of opportunities to be nice and helpful to other people every day many times we don t take the opportunity because we think we re too busy or someone else will help if you want to make the world around you better just do the right thing and help instead of thinking that it s someone else s problem for example if someone is carrying groceries to their car and they drop a bag help them by picking up the groceries and loading them back into the bag the simple things like that are very much appreciated by anyone help the homeless the homeless are a vulnerable group that are often misunderstood by helping the homeless both locally and across the world you ll be improving people s lives and helping to create more sustainable and safe cities help women women have traditionally been another vulnerable group though conditions have improved in many places even in the most feminist countries you will still see unequal pay and disproportionate abuse do what you can to help women not just in the obvious places like third world countries but also closer to home remember by creating a gender equal society we open up more opportunities for everyone,Education-and-Communications
how to teach kids to tell time,telling time is a tricky business especially for kids but as a parent or teacher you can make learning how to tell time a fun activity by making clocks with your kid before you begin making your clocks make sure your kid knows the basics once the clocks are made you can start teaching them the different blocks of time,practice counting to 60 kids need to be able to count to 60 in the correct order in order to tell time have your child write down the numbers 1 through 60 on a piece of paper as they write each number have them recite the number as well post this piece of paper on a wall and have them recite the numbers regularly 1 x research source while you are out in public like at the grocery store point out double digit numbers and have your child repeat the number to you use counting songs to help your child practice counting for instance you could sing 100 bottles of milk together look for other counting songs online to encourage your child to learn make sure to reward them with playtime or their favorite snack for doing a good job practice counting by fives understanding groups of five will also make learning to tell time much easier have your child write down increments of five on a sheet of paper up to 60 as they write the numbers have them recite them as well make sure to point out that each number either ends in a 5 or a 0 2 x research source make a special count by 5s song to a catchy tune your kid can sing along to you can even add dance moves to the song for example at every quarter you put your hands in the air or stomp your feet sing this song regularly with your kid to help them become comfortable with counting by 5s you can also find song about counting by fives online such as on youtube teach them the general concept of time general concepts of time are the morning noon the evening and nighttime familiarize your kid with these concepts by associating each concept with certain activities then quiz your kid by asking them when certain things happen 3 x research source for example in the morning we eat breakfast and brush our teeth at noon we eat lunch and take a nap at night we read a book and go to sleep you can ask your kid what happens in the morning and what happens at night you can post a daily schedule chart so your child has a visual that shows the different things they do during the day refer to the chart when explaining the times of various daily events grab 2 paper plates and an analog clock the paper plates will be used to make the clocks the analog clock will be used as a reference for making the clocks place them on a table and sit with your kid at the table let your kid know in an excited voice that together you all will be making your very own clocks 4 x research source for example guess what we are doing today we are going to make our own clocks fold the paper plates into halves have your child hold their paper plate and fold it in half then rotate the plate and fold it in half again the paper plates should have a cross like crease in the middle you will use this crease as a reference point 5 x research source place stickers and numbers on the clock have your child place a sticker on the top of the clock face where the number 12 should be then referencing the analog clock ask them to write the number 12 under the sticker with a marker repeat this for the numbers 3 6 and 9 6 x research source fill in the clock once your kid has placed stickers and numbers on the 12 3 6 and 9 ask them to fill in the rest of the clock show your kid the analog clock as a reference 7 x research source for example tell them to place a sticker where the number 1 should be then have them right the number 1 next to the sticker repeat this for each number create pie slices on the clock have your child draw a line from the center of the clock to each number tell your child to color in each pie slice with a different color crayon 8 x research source try starting with red at one o clock working upward through the rainbow for each number this will help make the number progression more intuitive for your child than simply using random colors make the clock hands draw 2 clock hands on a poster board a long one for the minute hand and a short one for the hour hand have your child cut out the clock hands with scissors 9 x research source if your child is not old enough to use scissors safely then cut the minute and hour hands out for them attach the hands place the hour hand on top of the minute hand pierce a paper fastener through the ends of the clock hands then pierce the paper fastener through the middle of the clock turn the clock over and bend the fastener ends to secure the clock hands 10 x research source hold the paper clock next to the analog clock note how similar they look to your kid ask your kid if anything else needs to be added to the clock if nothing else needs to be added then you can move on 11 x research source differentiate between the hands point to both hands on the clock ask your kid what the major difference between the hands is if they are struggling you can give them a hint like is one longer than the other 12 x research source label the clock hands once they have identified that the hands are different lengths then explain the difference tell them that the shorthand is the hour hand and the long hand is the minute hand have your kid label the hands by writing down hour on the shorthand and minute on the long hand 13 x research source explain the hour hand point the hour hand at each number keeping the minute hand at 12 o clock tell your kid that each time the hour hand points at a number and the minute hand points at 12 o clock it is ___ o clock go through each number saying it is 1 o clock now now it is 2 o clock it s 3 o clock then have your kid repeat what you just did 14 x research source make sure to use the pie slices and colors to your advantage reinforce the idea that whenever the hour hand is in a given pie slice it is ___ o clock you can even associate activities with each number to help solidify the hours for example it is 3 o clock now which means it is time to watch your favorite cartoons or it is 5 o clock now which means it is time for soccer practice quiz your child with your kid s help pick a day of the week and write down a list of 5 to 7 activities with their associated times call out an activity and its associated time have your kid place the hour hand on the correct number if necessary gently correct your child s mistakes 15 x research source say for example school has ended which means it is 3 o clock move the hands and show me 3 o clock on your clock or it is 8 o clock which means it is time for bed move the hands and show me 8 o clock on your clock make a game of setting the paper clock together to match the times of daily activities use a working analog clock as a reference tool explain the double meaning of the numbers explaining that the number 1 also means 5 minutes and that the number 2 also means 10 minutes can be quite confusing to help your kid understand this concept pretend that the numbers are double agents with a secret identity like clark kent and superman 16 x research source for example tell your kid that the secret identity of number 1 is 5 then have them write down a small number 5 next to the number 1 repeat this for each number make sure to point out that you are counting by 5s go over each number s secret identity by singing your special count by 5s song explain the minute hand s role tell your kid that the numbers secret identities come out when the long hand i e the minute hand points at it keeping the hour hand still point the minute hand at each number and say the associated minutes than have your kid repeat the process back to you 17 x research source for example point the minute hand at 2 and say it is 10 minutes now then point the minute hand at 3 and say it is 15 minutes now demonstrate how to read the hour and minute hand together once your kid has the concept of the minute hand down you will need to teach them how to read the hour and minute hands together start with simple times such as 1 30 2 15 5 45 and so on point the hour hand at a number then point the minute hand at a number then say what time it is 18 x research source for example point the hour hand at 3 and the minute hand at 8 tell your kid that the time is 3 40 because the hour hand is pointing at 3 and the minute hand is pointing at 8 reinforce the idea that because the minute hand is the secret identity hand it reads as 40 and not 8 repeat this activity until your kid gets the hang of it add tick marks for the non 5 minutes once your kid understands 5 minute intervals add 4 tic marks between each interval start by writing 1 2 3 and 4 next to the tick marks between the 12 and 1 encourage your child to fill in the rest of the minutes counting out loud as you go then point the minute hand at a non 5 minute and the hour hand at an hour read the time 19 x research source for example point the minute hand at the fourth tick mark and the hour hand at 3 tell your kid that the time is 3 04 repeat this process until your kid understands how to read the tick marks on the clock quiz your child with your child make a list of 5 to 7 activities with their associated times have your kid move the hands of the clock to reflect the activities correct times it is okay to help your kid in the beginning just make sure to repeat the activity until your kid can point the hands at the right numbers without your help 20 x research source encourage your kid by rewarding them for doing a good job take them to the park or to the ice cream shop to celebrate a productive lesson make it challenging once your kid has mastered the activity on their handmade clock move to the analog clock that does not have the numbers secret identities repeat the activity with this clock to see how well your kid has mastered the concept of telling time 21 x research source,Education-and-Communications
how to calculate the case cube of a box,in the wholesale purchasing and shipping industry a case cube is a measurement denoting how much space a case of any given item will take up in your warehouse the case cube may be measured in cubic feet or cubic meters if you know the dimensions of a case you can easily find the case cube in order to plan out how to organize your warehouse,measure the length width and height of a single unit in either inches or meters 1 x research source whichever unit of measurement you use measure all dimensions in the same unit of measurement you could also measure the unit in centimeters but converting centimeters cubed to meters cubed the final measurement can be very cumbersome 2 x research source instead divide the centimeter measurements by 100 to convert them to meters before you move on 3 x research source the word unit refers to whatever quantity the item is being sold packaged in so a single bottle box or bag would be a unit but if the item in question is being sold as a 3 pack of bottles you d have to measure all 3 bottles as they re packaged together to get the dimensions for calculating the case cube multiply the length width and height of the unit together 4 x research source divide the result by 1728 if your measurements were in inches the resulting number is the case cube in feet cubed 5 x research source if your measurements were in meters no division is necessary your result is the case cube in meters cubed finished,Education-and-Communications
how to conduct academic research,whether you are a student or a professional you may need to conduct academic research strong research involves accessing and evaluating various forms of information you then analyze the information you find to answer a question or come to a conclusion about an issue once your research is complete you ll present your findings typically in a research paper or a presentation 1 x research source,determine a broad topic for your research if you re doing research for a class project you ll likely already have a broad topic provided by the class likewise if you re doing research for work your supervisor may indicate what they want you to look into for example if you re taking a history course on europe in world war ii the title of the course may be your broad topic your instructor might limit your topic further such as asking you to focus on france explore the broad topic to find a potential question within the broad topic of your project think about a more specific thing you d like to know or question you d like to answer depending on the context of your research you may need approval from an instructor or supervisor for example you may decide you want to research the activities of the french resistance in aiding the allies during world war ii a potential research question might be how did the french resistance provide intelligence to the allies some instructors may provide a list of research questions or other information to help you narrow your topic if you want to deviate from the list talk to your instructor about your interests conduct an initial search to test your question search online or use library databases to get a general idea of how much information is out there about your research question before you commit to it if you get a lot of results back you may want to narrow your question if you have a hard time finding anything you may need to broaden your scope identify key words to search and try different combinations to fully test your question for example if you are researching the french resistance during world war ii you might do a search for french resistance intelligence and another for french assistance allies if you find articles or books that address your research question exactly choose a different question you might review the article or book you find to see if it mentions additional questions that still haven t been answered reevaluate your research question based on what you ve learned after your test searches look at your research question again decide whether your original research question is actually in line with the scope of your project if it isn t you may need to expand or narrow your focus 2 x research source if you re writing a research paper consider its length generally a shorter paper should cover a narrower topic make sure you have enough sources available use non academic sources as a starting point books as well as newspaper and magazine articles can increase your familiarity with your topic they may also introduce you to academic sources and experts whose work you can seek out 3 x research source documentary films can also serve as good introductory sources you won t necessarily be referencing any of these sources in your project you re simply using them to get a better feel for your topic the experts in the field and the sources available identify locations of likely sources based on your preliminary research determine what kind of sources are most likely to have information that will help you answer your research question in most cases you ll use a mixture of books scholarly articles and online sources 4 x trustworthy source purdue online writing lab trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines go to source for example if you re researching history your likely sources will be published books and scholarly articles by historians if you re researching the development of smart phones on the other hand you ll probably find most of your sources online or in tech magazines you may need to use a university or specialty library which likely has resources that aren t available at libraries open to the general public contact the library you want to use to find out how you can gain access search for books and scholarly articles published books and scholarly articles are typically preferred sources for academic research retrieving sources typically involves making a trip to the library you may be able to use the catalogue on the library s website to request titles before you go 5 x research source depending on your topic it may be possible to do all of your research online this is likely if you re researching something trendy or cutting edge such as a new tech development many scholarly articles can be found in electronic databases university libraries typically allow free access to these databases for students and faculty get a research librarian to assist you research librarians are specifically trained to find sources of information they can help locate books articles and other sources of information that you may not have been able to find on your own 6 x research source in the library look for the desk called the research desk or reference desk these desks are often towards the back of the library you can ask at the main desk or circulation desk if you aren t sure where to go tell the research librarian your research question and let them know what sources you ve found so far as well as what types of sources you re looking for they may have additional sources or different search terms to suggest keep organized notes on each of your sources get a stack of index cards to use for notes for each source write the author s name and the title on one side of the index card on the other side make a note of any information related to your research question 7 x research source if you read material that you want to quote write the quote exactly on a note card then write the page number where that quote can be found this will differentiate quotes from other notes it can also help to write a key word that identifies the issue the notes on the card relate to so you can organize cards related to different sections of your paper as you go this way you ll be able to tell at a glance if there s a part of your paper that needs more sources or information synthesize your information and tie up loose ends as you approach the end of your research you may find areas that you need to explore further try to fill in any gaps in understanding that you have any further research you need to do at this point shouldn t be too involved 8 x research source if your research raises additional questions that are outside the scope of your project you could simply acknowledge that they exist and would require further research craft your thesis statement based on what you ve found your thesis statement is essentially the answer to your research question our the conclusion that you ve come to as a result of your research 9 x research source your thesis statement makes a claim or takes a position and tells your readers why your position is important for example if you re writing a paper about the french resistance in world war ii for a history class your thesis statement might be by providing intelligence to the allies sabotaging german efforts and rescuing allied pilots whose planes were shot down the french resistance weakened the nazi regime identify what type of source you re using sources may be primary or secondary primary sources are original material while secondary sources interpret evaluate or collect information from primary sources for most academic research primary sources are preferred over secondary sources 10 x research source if you have a secondary source look in the footnotes or bibliographies to get information about the original source the citation should allow you to find the primary source and evaluate it yourself you may need to use a secondary source if the primary source is not available to you for example if you read an article in which a book is quoted you would want to find the quoted book if at all possible however if the book was published a long time ago and is out of print you may have no choice but to use the secondary source review the credentials of the author or producer of the source in most cases the author of a source you re using for academic research will be a professor in the field if they aren t a professor look at their background and experience to determine whether they should be considered an expert 11 x research source for science or tech topics professionals working in the field are often just as reliable as professors or other academic experts if you find the author s name mentioned by other sources that often means they are respected in the field if other professionals have relied on their work that s a good sign that you can rely on it as well check the year the source was published generally you want your research to include the most up to date information if a source was published 5 or 10 years ago the information may be outdated for research in more cutting edge or rapidly developing fields information may be outdated after a year or less 12 x research source whether the year of publication affects the reliability of the information depends on your overall topic for example if you re conducting research on ancient greek philosophy the date of publication wouldn t necessarily matter however if you were conducting research on social media and voting you would want to use sources published within the last year assess the reputation of the publisher of the source books and journals typically are published by a university press or other academic publisher you might also find books published by mainstream publishing companies such as penguin or random house 13 x research source be wary of small independent presses or self published books they don t have robust fact checking and editing like larger established presses do reputation is particularly important for online sources search for reviews or complaints about websites to find out if people in the field consider it to be a good source of information you can also ask your instructor or supervisor if you re not sure consider the reliability of online sources your reader should be able to find the sources you used in your research find out how long a website has been online whether it is attached to an established institution and the likelihood the website will remain online 14 x research source for example a website run by a university history department would likely be considered a reliable online source,Education-and-Communications

how to write about your hobbies and interests,the interests and hobbies section of a resume or college application provides a good opportunity to showcase your personality a well executed one can even compensate for a lack in experience or education although you might think that all resumes are alike you should always gear your document toward the specific audience who will be reading it taking into consideration what they want from you as an applicant this article will discuss how to write about your hobbies and interests for the two audiences for a resume a college admissions committee and a potential employer,format your application resume by priority you likely know the basic content of a resume education work experience skills awards and hobbies however listing all that information is not enough you must put thought into the order in which that information is presented on the resume 1 x research source dobrin sidney i christopher j keller and christian r weisser technical communication in the twenty first century columbus ohio prentice hall 2010 print college admissions committees are far more interested in your grades work experience skills and awards than they are in your hobbies and interests as such the hobbies and interests section of your resume should be presented toward the end of your resume end with it don t lead with it prioritize individual activities as well you can either list your activities chronologically as you probably did in the work experience section or from most to least impressive always remember that resumes are top down documents meaning you should lead with what you most want the reader to know about you 2 x research source use appropriate terminology although you may think of tennis or chess as a fun hobby the language you use in your resume should indicate more gravity rather than titling your hobbies and interests section hobbies call it activities or extracurricular activities by using more formal diction you subtly give the impression that you exercised dedication and professionalism in practicing these activities rather than simply goofing around and having a good time this is what colleges are looking for choose a formatting style for your listed sections all of the sections of your resume that include detailed lists should be formatted in the same way the activities section of your resume should be formatted the same way as the work experience section there is no single correct method to use but you want to make sure that you give yourself room to not simply list your activities but expand on them in a concise manner do not simply list all of your activities with commas this suggests that you have nothing to say about what you did other than the fact that you did it break each activity into its own bullet point decide whether you will write in full sentences or short phrases a resume should not be overly long ideally it should fit onto a single page if you find that your resume has too much length use phrases rather than full sentences for example tennis state champions 2013 2014 co captained varsity team 2012 14 member of varsity team 2010 14 if your resume is not long enough and you need to develop length you can write that same information out in full sentences tennis as a member of the varsity team from 2010 to 2014 i helped my team win the state championship in both 2013 and 2014 as co captain from 2012 to 2014 i provided leadership both on and off the court leading team workouts during the off season and keeping teammates accountable to one another demonstrate well roundedness 3 x research source college admissions officers don t expect high school seniors to know specifically what their futures will hold although in your essays you want to demonstrate that you have a plan for your future and lofty goals colleges know that in reality student plans often change as they enter coursework and develop their interests in college the activities section of your resume is the place to demonstrate that you don t have a one track mind you have a variety of interests that can be developed over your four years in college if possible present an array of activities that demonstrate an engaged curious mind athletics volunteerism academic teams interest in both the humanities speech team and stem areas mathletes etc the more well rounded you seem the more appealing you will be to a committee that is trying to assess how you will develop over the next four years set yourself apart from the pack 4 x research source this may seem to contradict the previous step but you don t want to present yourself as so well rounded that you re indistinguishable from all the other applicants consider which activity you have engaged in that most sets you apart from the rest of the applicant pool demonstrate a high level of interest in at least one of your activities if you were a team captain elected official or an otherwise engaged member of a group you need to highlight that as well as possible describe the leadership qualities you may have developed through this activity as key club president i chaired weekly meetings delegated club responsibilities into committees expanded our presence by recruited peers into volunteerism and oversaw member training before sending volunteers out into the community explain what peripheral qualities you developed over my four years in the key club i developed an abiding dedication to underserved populations in local communities choose language carefully to dress up your activities much of this advice so far has assumed that you have a wide variety of impressive activities that can be easily listed on your resume unfortunately this is not the case for many college applicants while you should never fabricate activities for your resume you can make what few activities you have seem more impressive by choosing your language carefully use the active voice throughout every document you submit in the application process 5 x research source the passive voice suggests that you passively received skills or qualities from your life experiences whereas the active voice demonstrates your engagement you earned those skills note the difference between being on the football team taught me the importance of being a team player and i strengthened the team s resolve and success by stressing to individual players the importance of group cohesion to the achievement of our goals take credit wherever possible even if you weren t in leadership positions even if you don t think you got a lot out of an activity think about what skills and qualities you could have developed for example you might have been an awful cheerleader but you can still say i devoted myself to grueling practices daily throughout the season and developed an effective time management system through which i balanced schoolwork and cheering while dedicating myself fully to both even if you re not going to make the collegiate cheer squad you ve still demonstrated that you can manage your time something you learned from cheerleading decide whether or not a hobbies and interests section is appropriate for this job depending on the application conventions in the industry you re applying in it may be inappropriate to include your hobbies on your resume at all the potential employer may find it irrelevant and you don t want that feeling to be attached to your application 6 x research source research the corporate culture of the company you re applying to some companies encourage employees to bring their interests into the creative workplace for example google explicitly cultivates an open culture workplace where hobbies are welcomed 7 x research source a hobbies section would be very appropriate for an application in the tech industry with a company like google however if you re applying for a position at an accounting firm the corporate culture may not be as welcoming of your hobbies leave them off that resume be brief whereas a college admissions officer is looking to get a sense of how you might develop over the course of your undergraduate career a potential employer wants to know as concisely as possible whether you would fit into the workplace or not stick to 7 words or less per hobby or interest don t dwell on how you feel at one with nature when you go biking every morning if you re applying for a job with a consulting firm simply say that you bike regularly and participate in races choose the interests you include carefully 8 x research source don t list an interest if you re not actually passionate about it if it comes up in an interview your lack of passion and knowledge will give you away as a resume passer choose interests that not only mean a lot to you but also demonstrate the kind of person you are for example reading is a fairly generic activity that doesn t reveal that much about you however running marathons suggests that you possess a high level of dedication and that you can overcome obstacles listening to music doesn t tell your employee anything about you but i have practiced classical piano for 17 years tells them a lot volunteering tells the employer something about you but it s not as detailed as it could be say instead that you ve volunteered weekly at the same soup kitchen for 3 years or that you bring your expertise from your state champion high school football team to bear when volunteering as a coach for community football league generally hobbies that show leadership skills personal initiative dedication or drive are good boosters for your resume connect your interests to the job 9 x research source wherever possible demonstrate how the skills and qualities you develop through your hobbies make you a better candidate for the position for which you re applying for example a consulting firm may not care about what how biking up a mountain brings you closer to nature but they will want to know that you have participated in several large scale races that required dedication and grit in training or that you suffered a serious injury that at some point threatened to derail your hobby but that you are not fazed by obstacles and you worked through it,Education-and-Communications

how to create a successful project for school,school projects can come in a variety of forms and the exact process you ll need to create a successful one will vary from project to project subject to subject and class to class however some general steps and best practices can help you tackle any project on your plate more successfully you ll need to pick a topic and plan out your project next you ll need to do some research finally you ll need to put everything together in your final project,begin early it s always best to begin an assignment as soon as you get it your teacher has given you a long time to do it for reason it s going to take that much time to do it begin by making a plan early so you have time to complete everything you need to do that way you won t be working the night before to finish the project read the assignment the assignment will give you detailed instructions about what you need to do block out distractions and really read what you are required to do if the teacher hasn t already done it break the project down into components so you understand exactly what you re teacher is asking you to do 1 x research source for instance maybe your assignment is create a visual representation of the civil war you can pick one battle one idea one speech a defining moment or focus on the war as a whole make sure to include relevant dates and people in your representation you can break this down into parts 1 make something visual about the civil war 2 choose a focus 3 include relevant dates 4 include relevant people brainstorm ideas brainstorming is a way to get your ideas on paper basically you spend time writing out what you want to do and connecting ideas to help get your creative juices flowing it can help you focus on what you want to do as well as come up with things you hadn t thought of you can use one of several techniques to brainstorm 2 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source try freewriting take out a sheet of paper on the top write down something such as civil war project start writing about the project don t stop yourself or censor ideas just let them come as they will for instance maybe you could start out by writing for me one of the defining points of the civil war was the gettysburg address it really made clear that the fight was about human equality but now i must make that visual four score and seven years ago i could take individual lines maybe connect ideas to defining parts of the war 3 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source try a map start with a circle in the middle of the paper with civil war project written in the middle of it draw a line from the

where the largest groupings are and let that guide your focus 4 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source pick a focus while it may be tempting to pick a broad topic such as the whole civil war it will actually be easier if you narrow that down that way you won t get bogged down in as many details 5 x research source the best way to pick a topic is to choose what you focused on in your brainstorming for instance maybe you think the gettysburg address is a good focal point 6 x research source however if your topic is still too broad such as battles in the civil war try picking one aspect within that topic you could choose one battle you think is defining or a particular aspect of the battles such as battle fatigue in soldiers 7 x research source decide how you want to represent your project if it s a visual project as the example has been throughout this article think about the best way to represent your ideas if you are doing several important events maybe a visual timeline would work best if you are working on something that is geographically based such as battles maybe a map with added details would be better play to what your project needs you can even think about doing something 3 dimensional instead of 2 dimensional maybe you could make a 3 d map of the battles depicting the movement of troops alternatively you could try sculpting out of papier mâché maybe you could sculpt abraham lincoln and use scripts coming off his body to tell your story sketch it out once you ve decided on how you want to make your project make a sketch of your project decide what will go where and how you will represent each part also decide what information you ll need to complete your project as that will help you with your research make an outline of the information you need to find 8 x research source to make an outline start with the main topic you are covering maybe you re doing the gettysburg address write that at the top next break down your project into sub headings maybe your subheadings could be speech background location of speech and impact of speech under your subheadings jot down the basic ideas of what you ll need for instance under speech background you might need the date what battle preceded the speech and the reason lincoln gave the speech make a list of materials you ll need before you begin list down all the materials you ll need from research materials to art supplies group them by where you can find them such as home the library and the store allot your time make subgoals within your project that is divide your project into manageable chunks such as getting materials together researching the speech writing out the text for the project painting the parts and putting the project together assign time for each chunk including deadlines work from the final deadline backward for instance if you have 4 weeks to complete your project say you ll spend the last week painting and putting the project together the week before that write out the text for your project the week before that research your project in the first week make your plan and get your materials together if needed divide your project further for instance researching the speech may need to be divided into several days worth of work gather the appropriate materials spend some time gathering what you need from various places ask your parents to take you where you need to go if you can t drive yourself put it all where you will work on your project decide what type of research materials you need decide what kind of resources would be most appropriate for your project for a historical project for instance books and scholarly articles are most appropriate you might also look into newspaper articles which give you a sense of what was going on at the time as well as personal correspondence from famous people 9 x research source decide how many sources you need if you re doing an in depth college project you ll need more sources than if you re doing a basic junior high project for a college project you may need eight to ten sources or more while for a junior high project you may only need one or two books 10 x research source use your library to find them your librarian can guide you to the best databases for your materials for instance you can use the main book catalog to find books however you might need to use article databases to find scholarly articles which is a different screen altogether when using an article database narrow the search engine to only relevant databases for instance platforms such as ebscohost carry a wide range of smaller databases and you can narrow your search down to one relevant to your topic such as a database focused on history 11 x research source you can also research the archives of particular newspapers while some newspapers offer free access to their archives others might require you to pay 12 x research source narrow your materials once you ve gathered a bunch of materials together you need to sort through them to decide what s actually relevant sometimes an article or book that sounds relevant may not be as helpful as you thought take notes and cite sources make notes related to your topic be as detailed as you can but try to put it in your own words as you write it down as you make notes make sure you are including the biographical information about the book 13 x research source you ll need the author s full name the title of the book the publisher the edition the date it was published the city it was published in the title and author of individual articles in the book if it has them and the page number where you found the information for articles you ll need the author s full name the title of the article and the journal the volume and issue if it has them the page numbers of the article the page number you found it and the digital online identifier number doi which is usually on the description page in the catalog 14 x research source write out your text your project will have some text on it to represent your ideas on your sketch identify where the text will go use your research to write your text though put it in your own words in addition make sure you are citing your sources which means you are saying where you got the information 15 x research source your teacher should tell you how should cite your sources or what guidelines you should be using if you don t know how to write according to those guidelines try an online resource such as purdue s online writing lab it covers the basics of the major citation styles 16 x research source paint or draw your project if you re doing an artistic project begin painting or drawing the pieces if you re using something such as papier mâché start building your sculpture if you re designing it on the computer start making your art or gathering images to use pull your project together write or type out your text put the finishing touches on the visual parts glue or tape the project together as needed so it makes one cohesive whole use what you sketched earlier to pull your project together into your final draft 17 x research source before you turn it in make sure you covered everything your

patterns once you ve settled on an area try to incorporate the region s tone slang and diction keeping a notebook in your pocket and writing down unique idioms and phrases is helpful as well with enough practice you ll sound like a native speaker in no time,adopt the way that americans use articles in everyday speech in english the articles are the a and an the way that americans use these articles is unique when compared to other forms of english but there are no strict rules for how to use them in general the article is only dropped for church college class and a few other nouns try to repeat back a phrase that sounds odd to you by using the new article to get used to it 1 x research source an american would say they go to college but they d also say go to the university a british or irish speaker would say they went to hospital but an american speaker always goes to the hospital the difference between using a and an isn t the first letter that follows the article it s actually whether the sound of the first syllable is a vowel or consonant you always use an with vowel sounds and a consonants since americans pronounce honor like on er it s an honor to meet someone if you re speaking american english article usage is one of the things that can make learning english so difficult stick with it and you ll get used to using the proper articles over time use american terms for everyday items to blend in like australian british and irish english there are a plethora of words that are unique to american english using a term like motorway or ice lolly is a dead giveaway that you aren t an american english speaker if you want to blend in get used to using american terms and work on committing them to memory by using them every day 2 x research source it can be tough to get used to using american terminology if you aren t familiar with it give it time you ll get used to it the more you talk and listen to americans watching a lot of american movies and

incorporating them in your speech americans have a lot of idioms which are culturally recognized phrases that differ from a phrase s literal meaning for example when an american says that it is raining cats and dogs they mean that it s raining hard not that animals are falling out of the sky when you hear an idiom ask what it means and then try using it in your everyday conversation to get used to it you ll learn lots of idioms over time simply by trying them out 3 x research source i could care less actually means i couldn t care less in american english while this isn t technically an idiom it is an odd phrase that means something different than what it literally communicates hold your vowels and rs to replicate general american english while every region of the united states speaks differently there is a stereotypical form of american english that serves as a solid baseline for american dialects generally speaking use hard vowels and r sounds by sounding them out more thoroughly other forms of english like british irish and australian english tend to blend vowels and r sounds while general american english tends to over enunciate them 4 x research source including a harder r sound makes words like card sound like kaard instead cawd another example would be other which might sound like oth a in british english but sounds like uh ther in american english opting for hard vowels instead of soft vowels makes words like cut sound like khut in american english while it might sound like khat in british english swap o i and e sounds for a southern accent while there are several versions of a southern accent you can create a general southern accent by swapping vowel sounds turn o sounds into i sounds and i sounds into o sounds i sounds are often drawn out to sound like two e s in words like bill which makes it sound like bee hill the reverse is also true words like pen sound like pin 6 x research source other examples include feel sounding like fill and think sounding like thenk note that in each example the e and the i sounds are swapped swapping the o and i makes words like hot sound like hight and words like like sound like lok use aw instead of al or o for a northeastern accent while new york boston and philadelphia all have unique accents they all tend to replace a sounds and o sounds with aw or uh use the roof of your mouth more than you usually do and use aw to replace soft a sounds and o sounds for a northeastern accent 7 x research source this makes words like call and talk sound like kawl and tawk and words like off and love sound like awf and lawve speak like you re from the midwest by manipulating o sounds while the midwest has a variety of accents most of them replace short o sounds with short a sounds play with o sounds to make them shorter or longer to sound like you re from the midwest 8 x research source the manipulation of o sounds makes words like hot sound like hat however long o sounds tend to be extended so words like whose sound more like hooz instead of whues over pronounce k sounds and drop t sounds to sound californian while there s a bit of variety on the west coast californian speakers tend to expand their mouths to accent k sounds while dropping t sounds in addition use a hard r whenever a word ends with r 9 x research source the californian accent makes a phrase like i like that here sound like i lyke tha hear use y all and other southern slang to seem southern the easiest southern slang to incorporate is to use y all instead of you all or everyone southerners often say git instead of get other common slang terms include yonder which means over there and fixin which means about to do 10 x research source the south has a lot of idioms and phrases like bless your heart which means you are sweet and pretty as a peach which means that something is pleasant or cute the south is a very religious region of the united states to speak like a southerner use the word bless often phrases like bless your heart and god bless you are common in the south adopt northeastern slang to sound like an east coast native speakers on the east coast tend to say ey or ah during breaks in speech bostonians will use wicked instead of awesome or really they also tend to use hella instead of very a hella wicked smaht person is someone that is really very smart for example new yorkers are notorious for saying fuggetaboutit a truncated version of forget about it it means that everything is fine 11 x research source raising your voice a little isn t necessarily considered rude on the east coast in philadelphia the word jawn can replace any noun and you ll have to use context clues to determine what it means for example that jawn could mean that girl that food or that politician depending on the subject of discussion philadelphians also call submarine sandwiches hoagies if someone in the northeast refers to the city they re talking about new york city the state of new york outside of new york city is almost always called new york state utilize you guys and drink pop to sound like a midwesterner always say you guys instead of ya ll you all or everyone to sound like an

of went or go they also use the word dip to mean leave or vacate speak like you re from california by acting excited and using dude many californians use an upward inflection while you re speaking even a slight upward inflection creates the impression that they re excited or in a really good mood a key component of sounding californian is to use the word dude as well dude is a regional specific term for a person you re familiar with usually male 13 x research source radical and sick are common terms for awesome if someone from california says that you re a sick dude they re paying you a

how to discover your talents,your perception of yourself is very complex similar to how you cannot see your own nose you may often be blinded to the things that you are best at it can be really hard to identify your brightest talents and they are often in the places you least expect you may even be very good at things that you perceive yourself as being bad at there are many good reasons to want to explore your talents but it s going to take a little work,open your mind to all paths because you are likely blind to what some of your talents really are a good place to start when evaluating your talents is to just open your mind to the possibilities keep in mind that talents extend beyond just playing the guitar or dancing like a pro talents come in all shapes and sizes and extend into many areas of life 1 x research source for example being able to read emotions very accurately is a very useful talent look back on your past as you reflect on yourself in search of your talents start by looking at your past look at the things that you ve done 2 x research source look at the things you ve enjoyed look at the times when you really excelled ask yourself questions like what am i most proud of that i ve done or when was i so proud that i didn t care what anyone thought one good thing to think about was what your childhood was like what did you do a lot as a kid what did you enjoy what were you known for sometimes this can reveal some of your deepest talents and certainly will reveal interests that can be probed further think about your hobbies as your personality is made by them they are the things you do regularly and your hidden talent is that which you can do better than everyone so focus on your hobbies and how you do them every single step another thing you can think about are the times in your life that you ve been challenged think about the tough situations that you ve had to deal with times of trial can often reveal your hidden skills for example when your dad had a heart attack maybe you kept your head and called 911 staying alert and calm in an emergency is a really useful talent think about what you enjoy the things that make you happy can also reveal your talents think about the things that you love to do do people ever give you compliments on it do they ever ask for your help with it you might not think of it as a talent but it probably is 3 x research source do you ever completely lose track of time you start doing something and you just don t even notice time passing this might hint at your talent 4 x research source for example maybe you get lost when you re modding your favorite video game this might be one of your talents listen to how you talk do you ever find yourself rambling to your family or your best friend about this subject that means so much to you this might be another hint at a talent you have write down everything that you enjoy this will help you to see what things you truly enjoy doing and give you an opportunity to think about why you enjoy these things for example you might enjoy playing fantasy football or walking in nature doing these things may allow you to use the special knowledge that you have about these subjects evaluate what you re good at now there s a big difference between what you enjoy and what you re good at you might think of your talents only being things that you love doing but it s important to remember that your talents are often things you don t enjoy or things you don t even think about this is why it s important to take a long hard look at what you re actually good at think about things that come naturally to you things you don t struggle with do you ever find yourself telling someone nevermind it s easier if i do it or here let me help you with that do you find yourself correcting people these behaviors usually indicate something that you re good at and know a lot about think about times you were successful look back on your life and think about times where you really succeeded times where you felt about to burst with the pride of your success this can indicate a talent you possess for example maybe you helped your boss rearrange and reorganize his office and helped things at your work run so much more smoothly organization is a very useful talent write the story of your life this exercise can help you reveal not only the talents that you have but also talents that you should consider developing write about what you were like as a kid what you liked to do before and after school what your favorite subjects were write about growing up write about where you re at in your life now now write about your future write about where you want to go write about what you want people to say at your funeral you may also want to write about what you would like to do with your time if money was not an issue what activities would you most like to do if you did not have to worry about money considering this can help you to identify your interests and talents this exercise reveals your priorities and what you really think is important about yourself it can also reveal what you want for your life helping you focus on talents you should cultivate if you want to achieve your dreams ask around having an outside perspective other people may find it easier to see what you re good at ask around and people will usually be happy to tell you what they see as your strengths be sure to talk to people that know you well but also people that barely know you both will see you in different ways and the differences that they see can tell you even more about yourself 5 x research source open up time for new things your life needs to have room for discovering your talents if you spend all day on the couch after school or work or you spend all of your waking weekend hours at parties then you re going to have very little time for self discovery your talents will often lie in activities that you ve not tried yet and if you don t make time for those things then you ll never expand beyond what you are now think about how you spend your time right now consider your priorities and then find things that you can cut to make more time for new experiences make time for yourself while other people can help you find your talents it s also important to take some time that s just for you self discovery does require a lot of self reflection and if you re spending all of your time watching movies with your friends you probably won t get the time you need to really understand yourself take some quiet days that are just for you and spend them doing new activities 6 x research source build on your existing skills you probably already have some basic skills any skill that you possess can be turned into a real talent but you need to take the time to develop it and really work on experiencing all of the different activities that go in to that talent you might have experienced only a small aspect of a possible talent and you will need to experience much more if you really want to cultivate it for example let s say that you re pretty good at interior design you certainly made your room looks pretty nice well try developing that skill into a full talent study up on interior design mess around with computer programs for interior design and cultivate an awesome pinterest by investing in this skill and exploring it further you can develop your minor skill into a talent try things you would never have tried before 7 x research source sometimes you may tell yourself that you can t do things but you will never know what you are capable of unless you go outside of your comfort zone maybe you think you re not good enough or not smart enough most often you see yourself as not that kind of person however you don t know you re that kind of person until you start becoming that person you have to give life a chance to surprise you you re much more incredible and interesting than you give yourself credit for take a risk and try something totally different than anything you ve ever tried before 8 x research source for example try rock climbing or scuba diving write a book start a business these kinds of things take work but for many they are at the very essence of who they are it s a good idea to try to factor in things you already know you can do for example say you know that you like hanging out with little kids from this you can say that you probably have a fun easy going nature this means you might excel at work with animals which is similar and requires some of the same underlying traits take classes in subjects that interest you if there s a subject that interests you and you think you might want to develop it into a talent consider taking a class getting more information and finding out what the experience would really be like can tell you if it s really something you could have a talent for it also will help you get the basic skills needed to start developing your talent if you decide it s something that you want to do you can take online classes for free from websites like coursera and university of the people if you don t have access to education resources if you do have money and time to devote to a class though try your local community and technical colleges as well as your local community center travel to expand your experiences traveling is one of the most impactful experiences you can have it will challenge you and teach you more about yourself than you thought possible however you can t just take the easy route and go on a cruise or guided trip go on your own go somewhere different from anywhere you ve ever been immerse yourself in the experience try new things you ll find yourself struggling in some areas but you ll also find that there are other activities that you can do with ease or that make you really happy traveling can seem expensive but it really depends on where you go when and what you do it doesn t have to be an expensive experience you can also travel a little more close to home and get the same sort of benefits for example if you re from the us try going out into the canadian countryside or a backpacking trip in mexico take on challenges when you have to struggle when you re removed from your usual comfortable environment is when you learn the most about yourself when you shut yourself off to challenges by just sticking to a quiet life and never leaving the house or even backing out when times get tough or running from your problems you deny yourself the chance to shine let challenges happen try to tackle your problems and get out and live life a bit more so that you have the chance to conquer challenges that you encounter 9 x research source for example your grandma might get sick and need help try helping her out you might find that you re really good at connecting with and helping the elderly volunteer to help shift your perspective in experiencing just your own life and your own world it s easy to have your mind closed to the possibilities the possibilities of what you are and the possibilities of what you could be when you help others in significant and impactful ways you ll find that you see yourself in a new light your priorities will change you might even get the chance to shine in a talent you didn t even know you had or build a new talent through the work you do for example local parks departments often need help removing invasive plants or in building new structures like playgrounds you can volunteer and you might find that you re good at identifying plants woodworking reading

how to help others,helping others is a great way to spread joy to others and get the most out of life whether you re helping out at home or in your community there are a number of opportunities you can take advantage of,ask what you can do to help talk to a family member or friend and ask what they most need help with and offer your services by offering before they need to ask you you are showing that you care about them 1 x research source remember to follow through with whatever they ve asked of you simply asking won t actually help them make a routine of asking around your circle of friends and family for what they need before long helping others will simply be second nature to you listen often what people need is simply someone who will listen to them with kindness and without judgement when someone is telling you about themselves or a hardship they are going through don t simply leap in with your own feelings thoughts and stories practice active listening when you re listening to someone stay focused on what they are saying look at the speaker and let go of distracting thoughts if your mind wanders the other person will notice and they won t feel like you are paying attention 2 x research source try to avoid making judgments on the person you re listening to not only will that close up the conversation but it will make the other person feel as if they can t trust you with their thoughts offer to do jobs or chores when someone is busy or stressed chores and jobs often slip through the cracks find out from your family and friends what they re too busy or stressed to do for themselves and set aside some time to do the chore or job for them do something like make a meal and bring it over to their house during a particularly busy or stressful time so they don t have to worry about feeding themselves this is a particularly kind thing to do for someone who has just had a loved one die or become seriously ill offer to watch your younger siblings or friend s children for free to give the parents a much needed break send something to let them know you re thinking of them a lot of times people can feel cut off from their friends and family and very alone just let a friend or family member know that you re thinking of them and that they are important to you it doesn t have to be a big grand gesture something small will do fine write a nice email or letter and include some reason why you like the recipient maybe reminisce about something fun or silly the two of you did if they ve recently had a family member die or fall ill or are struggling with depression tell them why they are important to you make up a care package maybe put in some home baked goods or some little things that they might enjoy if they like to knit maybe include a skein of a colorful yarn in the package volunteer volunteering is great way to help out others in your community look around for a homeless shelter or soup kitchen and spend some time there doing whatever needs to be done not only will this help others but you will get a new perspective on your own life 3 x research source work at a battered women s shelter and help women and children who have had traumatizing experiences get back on their feet try tutoring homeless children at the local shelter so that they can stay in school and not fall behind because the economy has been difficult for their family volunteer for hospice and really listen to the stories of the people who are going through their final days they will give you more perspective on the blessings and the hardships you will encounter in your own life donate to important causes this can be anything from a monetary donation to a charity or items like clothing that are needed by a local food bank or shelter if you don t have money to spare look through your unused items and see what you can part with that is in decent condition donate foods like unopened spices healthy non perishable goods like canned soups or beans give toys to the local shelters and food banks many of the children who take refuge there don t have any toys of their own redirect gifts instead of getting lots of new presents every birthday or present giving holiday like christmas have your friends and family make monetary donations to charities or some important cause you could even set up a fund that they can donate into for instance creating a fund to help low income children go to college stop to help if you see someone on the street who is struggling to carry all their groceries or who needs money for a bus fare give them a helping hand or some money it usually doesn t take much to help another human being out keep in mind that they may not always need help if someone says something like no thanks or i can handle it then just insisting may annoy them you won t always be able to tell if they really do need your help but it s best to back off if others are angry or in a hurry however if they refuse your help you should ask one more time and if they still refuse then walk away play freerice this is a simple website where you answer questions to donate rice to people in need they work through the un world food programme every time you answer a question ten grains of rice are donated there are a variety of categories including vocabulary and geography edit wikihow wikihow is always looking for new good editors and writers use click to give websites such as greatergood when doing this you want to be sure they are giving to good charities for example one of the sections of this one donates to autism speaks which is generally considered to be a charity that does more harm than good however the other sections are perfectly legitimate charities download the tab for a cause extension this is an extension where every time you open a new blank tab a customizable dashboard with a small ad comes up as your default new tab page the advertisement money is then apportioned to charities based on percentages of user votes one new tab is one vote just listen to someone s problems this will show a person that you actually care and you are trying to figure out the cause of the problem that person

how to do qualitative research,qualitative research is a broad field of inquiry that uses unstructured data collections methods such as observations interviews surveys and documents to find themes and meanings to inform our understanding of the world 1 x research source qualitative research tends to try to cover the reasons for behaviors attitudes and motivations instead of just the details of what where and when qualitative research can be done across many disciplines such as social sciences healthcare and businesses and it is a common feature of nearly every single workplace and educational environment,decide on a question you want to study a good research question needs to be clear specific and manageable to do qualitative research your question should explore reasons for why people do things or believe in something the research questions is one of the most important pieces of your research design it determines what you want to learn or understand and also helps to focus the study since you can t investigate everything at once your research question will also shape how you conduct your study since different questions require different methods of inquiry you should start with a burning question and then narrow it down more to make it manageable enough to be researched effectively for example what is the meaning of teachers work to teachers is too broad for a single research endeavor but if that s what you re interested you could narrow it by limiting the type of teacher or focusing on one level of education for example what is the meaning of teachers work to second career teachers or what is the meaning of teachers work to junior high teachers do a literature review a literature review is a process of studying what others have written about your research question and particular topic you read widely on the larger field and examine studies that relate to your topic you then draw up an analytical report that synthesizes and integrates the existing research rather than simply presents a short summary of each study in chronological order in other words you are researching the research 2 x research source for example if your research question focuses on how second career teachers attribute meaning to their work you would want to examine the literature on second career teaching what motivates people to turn to teaching as a second career how many teachers are in their second career where do most second career teachers work doing this reading and review of existing literature and research will help you refine your question and give you the base you need for your own research it will also give you a sense of the variables that might impact your research e g age gender class etc and that you will need to take into consideration in your own study a literature review will also help you to determine whether you are really interested and committed to the topic and research question and that there is a gap in the existing research that you want to fill by conducting your own investigation evaluate whether qualitative research is the right fit for your research question qualitative methods are useful when a question cannot be answered by a simple yes or no hypothesis often qualitative research is especially useful for answering how or what questions 3 x research source they are also useful when budgetary decisions have to be taken into account consider your ideal sampling size qualitative research methods don t rely as heavily on large sample sizes as quantitative methods but they can still yield important insights and findings 4 x research source for instance since it s unlikely that you have the funding to be able to study all second teachers everywhere in the united states perhaps you choose to narrow your study to a major urban area like new york or schools within 200km of where you live consider the possible outcomes because qualitative methodologies are generally quite broad there is almost always the possibility that some useful data will come out of the research this is different than in a quantitative experiment where an unproven hypothesis can mean that a lot of time has been wasted 5 x research source your research budget and available financial resources should also be considered qualitative research is often cheaper and easier to plan and execute for example it is usually easier and cost saving to gather a small number of people for interviews than it is to purchase a computer program that can do statistical analysis and hire the appropriate statisticians 6 x research source choose a qualitative research methodology the design of qualitative research is the most flexible of all the experimental techniques so there are a number of accepted methodologies available to you 7 x research source action research action research focuses on solving an immediate problem or working with others to solve problem and address particular issues 8 x research source ethnography ethnography is the study of human interaction in communities through direct participation and observation within the community you wish to study ethnographic research comes from the discipline of social and cultural anthropology but is now becoming more widely used 9 x research source phenomenology phenomenology is the study of the subjective experiences of others it researches the world through the eyes of another person by discovering how they interpret their experiences 10 x research source grounded theory the purpose of grounded theory is to develop theory based on the data systematically collected and analyzed it looks at specific information and derives theories and reasons for the phenomena case study research this method of qualitative study is an in depth study of a specific individual or phenomena in its existing context 11 x research source collect your data each of the research methodologies has uses one or more techniques to collect empirical data including interviews participant observation fieldwork archival research documentary materials etc the form of data collection will depend on the research methodology for example case study research usually relies on interviews and documentary materials whereas ethnography research requires considerable fieldwork 12 x research source direct observation direct observation of a situation or your research subjects can occur through video tape playback or through live observation in direct observation you are making specific observations of a situation without influencing or participating in any way 13 x research source for example perhaps you want to see how second career teachers go about their routines in and outside the classrooms and so you decide to observe them for a few days being sure to get the requisite permission from the school students and the teacher and taking careful notes along the way participant observation participant observation is the immersion of the researcher in the community or situation being studied this form of data collection tends to be more time consuming as you need to participate fully in the community in order to know whether your observations are valid 14 x research source interviews qualitative interviewing is basically the process of gathering data by asking people questions interviewing can be very flexible they can be on on one but can also take place over the phone or internet or in small groups called focus groups there are also different types of interviews structured interviews use pre set questions whereas unstructured interviews are more free flowing conversations where the interviewer can probe and explore topics as they come up interviews are particularly useful if you want to know how people feel or react to something for example it would be very useful to sit down with second career teachers in either a structured or unstructured interview to gain information about how they represent and discuss their teaching careers surveys written questionnaires and open ended surveys about ideas perceptions and thoughts are other ways by which you can collect data for your qualitative research for example in your study of second career schoolteachers perhaps you decide to do an anonymous survey of 100 teachers in the area because you re concerned that they may be less forthright in an interview situation than in a survey where their identity was anonymous document analysis this involves examining written visual and audio documents that exist without any involvement of or instigation by the researcher there are lots of different kinds of documents including official documents produced by institutions and personal documents like letters memoirs diaries and in the 21st century social media accounts and online blogs for example if studying education institutions like public schools produce many different kinds of documents including reports flyers handbooks websites curricula etc maybe you can also see if any second career teachers have an online meet group or blog document analysis can often be useful to use in conjunction with another method like interviewing analyze your data once you have collected your data you can begin to analyze it and come up with answers and theories to your research question although there are a number of ways to analyze your data all modes of analysis in quantitative research are concerned with textual analysis whether written or verbal 15 x research source coding in coding you assign a word phrase or number to each category start out with a pre set list of codes that you derived from your prior knowledge of the subject for example financial issues or community involvement might be two codes you think of after having done your literature review of second career teachers you then go through all of your data in a systematic way and code ideas concepts and themes as they fit categories you will also develop another set of codes that emerge from reading and analyzing the data for example you may see while coding your interviews that divorce comes up frequently you can add a code for this coding helps you organize your data and identify patterns and commonalities 16 x research source tobaccoeval ucdavis edu analysis reporting codingqualitativedata pdf descriptive statistics you can analyze your data using statistics descriptive statistics help describe show or summarize the data to highlight patterns for example if you had 100 principal evaluations of teachers you might be interested in the overall performance of those students descriptive statistics allow you to do that keep in mind however that descriptive statistics cannot be used to make conclusions and confirm disprove hypotheses 17 x research source narrative analysis narrative analysis focuses on speech and content such as grammar word usage metaphors story themes meanings of situations the social cultural and political context of the narrative 18 x research source hermeneutic analysis hermeneutic analysis focuses on the meaning of a written or oral text essentially you are trying to make sense of the object of study and bring to light some sort of underlying coherence 19 x research source content analysis semiotic analysis content or semiotic analysis looks at texts or series of texts and looks for themes and meanings by looking at frequencies of words put differently you try to identify structures and patterned regularities in the verbal or written text and then make inferences on the basis of these regularities 20 x research source for example maybe you find the same words or phrases like second chance or make a difference coming up in different interviews with second career teachers and decide to explore what this frequency might signify write up your research when preparing the report on your qualitative research keep in mind the audience for whom you are writing and also the formatting guidelines of the research journal you wish to submit your research to you will want to make sure that your purpose for your research question is compelling and that you explain your research methodology and analysis in

how to learn faster,in order to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing environments in which we live we need to learn more effectively and efficiently this article is intended to describe some basics for meta learning or learning about learning to help make it easier for you to find and use techniques to increase the quality and speed of your self directed learning this approach can be applied to any task in life where we are taking on the challenge of increasing our knowledge including some basic tasks that assist us in making the most of our brain power you can help your brain to absorb information more accurately and efficiently sometimes by just changing how you take care of your body using meta learning learning about learning techniques can help you learn how to take better care of your body in the most efficient and effective way,get plenty of sleep a lot of the time there s nothing wrong with you or how you study or learn your brain just can t hold the information because your body isn t getting something that it needs often that need is more sleep you ll want to be sure to get plenty of sleep if you want your brain to be alert enough to absorb information just drinking an extra cup of coffee isn t going to work this means you ll want to stop doing those late night study sessions instead go to bed early get a few hours of sleep and then get up early so that you can study more on a well rested brain studies have actually revealed that while we sleep the brain is flushed with a fluid that cleans it of toxins 1 x research source when we don t get enough sleep our brains are so overloaded with junk that it becomes difficult for the brain to function correctly how much is enough sleep really depends on you and how your body works seven to eight hours is what is recommended for most adults 2 x trustworthy source mayo clinic educational website from one of the world s leading hospitals go to source but some people need less and some people need more you should be able to feel awake and alert through most of the day without the aid of coffee if you re tired before four or five in the afternoon then you re probably not getting enough sleep or you might be getting too much eat enough food when you re hungry your brain will have a really hard time absorbing any information it s hard to focus when all your body can tell you is that your stomach is empty make sure that you get enough food for all of the major meals you might even want to choose something healthy to snack on while you study as well as during any classes or tests you might have to take it s also a good idea to make sure that you re eating healthy foods junk food doesn t give your body the nutrients it needs to perform at its best snack on some almonds or a couple of carrots in order to feel alert and focused instead of bloated and tired drink plenty of water your body is at its best when it s well hydrated when you don t get enough water you won t be able to focus you can easily become distracted whether you realize it or not by your thirst it can even lead to things like a headache making it even harder for you to learn different bodies need different amounts of water to stay hydrated the eight glasses a day that you hear recommended is just a rough estimate the best way to tell if you re getting enough water is to look at the color of your urine if it s pale or clear you re drinking enough any darker color means you could use more water get exercise of course you know that exercise is good for your body in lots of ways but did you know that it can also help you learn faster some studies have found that light exercise while studying can help you to learn faster 3 x research source for people who are very physical and active being forced to stay still for too long can also make it hard to stay focused so exercising while studying can also be helpful in that way for example try walking around a large room while you read your textbook record your class lectures and listen to the recordings while you use an elliptical machine at the gym there are lots of options just remember to keep the exercise light and do it while you study teach your brain to learn learning quickly is a habit and you might need to work to retrain your brain for good habits instead of bad ones improve your focus by doing complex tasks without breaks even if they re unrelated set aside a time and place that s just for learning and keep that place sacred perhaps most importantly find a way to make learning fun for you this will make your brain want to do more and you won t struggle to learn quite so much for example pursue learning about the subjects that you do enjoy eventually your brain will master the learning skills and you can apply those skills to subject areas that you don t enjoy too pick a goal look at the changes you want to make to measurably improve your quality of life which goals require you to learn more before you can confidently make the change you want look for a goal you could start on now without too much time required in this case the goal we have chosen is to take better care of our body then we are going to break it down what elements go along with taking better care of our body study as early as possible get plenty of sleep eat healthy food drink plenty of water get exercise research options for learning brainstorm criteria for which options you are attracted to and which you are not are you interested in researching on the internet do you want to talk with a nutritionist or a fitness instructor if you have difficulty when paying attention while reading would magazine articles be an effective option for learning trust your intuition if heading down a certain path doesn t feel right don t go that way if you begin reading on ways to improve your sleep habits and the information is not something you would be willing to use in your own life then stop reading and find a different resource do not continue simply because it is information coming from an expert or because everyone is doing it the information has to be useful to you refine your goal with research as you begin to look into ways to take better care of your body you may discover there is one element that you really want to focus on this narrows your goal from i want to take better care of my body to i want to take better care of my body by eating a healthier diet find someone who has done what you want to do and have them show you if you know someone who has changed elements of their lifestyle such as exercising more or implementing a healthier way of eating talk to them find out what they did how they did it and where they found their information do research on the internet take a class interview others and find a mentor try out different varieties of learning to see which one works best for you choose the best option pick something that is possible to do in your environment that you can work on constructively within your timeframe and that you can do successfully with the energy and attention you have do not decide to take a nutrition class if you are already pressed for time and won t have time to attend instead take a smaller piece such as following a nutritional plan whatever it is it needs to be something you can effectively add to your life consider time constraints geographic constraints and your mental state do not bring more stress to your life by taking on more than what works for your life circumstances learning should add to the quality of your life not take away from it schedule a time of day for learning and practicing what you learn having a set time for learning can help motivate you to continue the process develop the habit of paying attention to what you want to learn or improve upon emotions drive attention attention drives learning pay attention to your emotional reactions if you are researching exercise options and find yourself resisting explore why what is it about exercising that is causing the reaction there is a reason for resisting the learning experience don t become overwhelmed with all the choices sometimes we become distracted and overwhelmed by wanting to choose the right option there is no right or wrong it is about what works for you just pick one and try it if it doesn t work then pick another one experiment with learning to effectively conduct an experiment you need to have a plan a way to evaluate if the experiment is working and a time to reflect on the process and outcome the learning process works the same way setting a specific criteria allows you to see if you have met it or not when deciding on a nutritional plan do i want it to include 3 meals a day or do i need it to cover several smaller meals throughout the day be sure to have a method for keeping track of progress use whatever tools you have notebooks phone apps computer internet calendar blogs etc keep reflecting on your progress do i still need more information or do i have what i need to begin a new sleep routine set milestones and stick to them i want to find 3 new healthy dinner recipes to incorporate into my nutrition plan evaluate your results and milestones did you reach them did you learn enough to implement a new exercise plan have you found an effective way to improve your sleep habits a reminder in your calendar will prompt you to reflect set a check in date to evaluate the information you have learned see if it is effective is there is more you have realized that you need to know what worked and what didn t why refine your approach if the learning approach you chose worked then keep going with it if not go back and pick a different one and start experimenting pay attention when you learn things for the first time the best way to learn faster is to make sure that you re really paying attention when things are explained to you the first time even the smallest break in your focus can cause the information not to settle properly in your brain unfortunately there are few tricks for this you ll mostly need to learn how to maintain willpower try listening with the idea that you will have to answer a question immediately about the material such as your teacher calling on you or so that you can repeat the information back to yourself in fact if you re on your own repeating the information back to yourself paraphrased and in your own words can help to anchor the information in your brain take notes taking notes is another great way to maintain your focus as you learn the material the first time taking notes not only forces you to think about the material you re learning it also give you a framework to study from later taking notes doesn t mean writing down everything that is said all you have to do is write down the broad outline with specific information when you know it s important write down major facts and any explanations that you either have a hard time understanding or you know you won t remember because they are very complicated participate in class stay active in your learning experience this will not only help you stay focused it will also help your brain absorb the information better because it becomes a multi sensory experience rather than you just listening to someone talk there are lots of ways to participate in your learning experience from getting active in group work to asking questions during the lecture try to answer questions when the teacher asks don t worry about being wrong this is a learning experience and being wrong sometimes is a part of the process when you re split up into groups in order to do activities reading or discussion really embrace the experience and participate don t just sit quietly and do as little as possible engage your fellow students and ask them questions give your opinions and enjoy the experience ask questions when you don t understand or want to know more asking questions is another great way to stay focused as you learn material plus it will also help make sure that you really understand what you re learning when you don t understand what your teacher said or when you think something is interesting and want to know more don t be afraid to ask create a helpful environment if your lab partner is a huge nuisance or your place to study at home is in front of the tv then it s probably no surprise that you re having trouble learning quickly you ll need a quiet environment that s dedicated to studying if you want to give your brain the best chance at learning the information having a quiet distraction free environment means that you won t get distracted having a place set aside for studying and learning can also help because it triggers your brain into working in a particular way if your classroom environment is a problem ask your teacher for help you might be able to move seats or work with someone else if your home environment is the problem find unique places to study you can go to a library if there s one close enough you can also do things like study in your bathroom or really early in the morning if you have noisy roommates work with your learning style learning styles are the different ways in which our brains best absorb information there are many different learning styles and while we all can learn using every learning style there are usually one or two that work best for an individual you can take online tests to help gauge what your learning style might be but if you have a teacher available to help you they should be able to help you figure it out you can even talk to them about adding more of that learning style to how they teach for example if you find that you learn best when you can look at charts and graphs you might be a visual learner try studying by drawing up your own infographics to help you remember the information more do you find that you remember how things sound or that you can clearly remember what you were reading as you listened to a particular song if so you might be an auditory learner try recording your class lectures to listen to before and after you study or even while you study if the information is very clearly the same do you sit in the classroom feeling like you might burst because you need to go for a run do you absent mindedly tap your foot while you listen to lectures you might be a physical learner try fiddling with a small object during class or go for a walk while you study to help you learn faster learn in the right way for the type of material you re working with different kinds of subjects are learned better in different ways you might not be studying for the subject you want to learn in the most helpful way adjust how you study so that you re learning the right skills in a way that works with your brain for example our brains are designed to learn language through interactions listening and usage you ll learn english much faster if you immerse yourself and spend time speaking it rather than just looking at flash cards if you need more help learning english faster see our article on the topic here another example is with learning math instead of just solving the same problems and looking at the same examples over and over again look and solve lots of different problems that use the same skills 4 x research source doing problems with related but different skills can also help solidify your understanding of what you re trying to learn get evaluated for a learning disability if you really find that you can t focus while learning or that your brain doesn t seem to absorb any of the information even with help and different techniques then you might want to consider getting evaluated for a learning disability there are lots of learning disabilities and most are fairly common it is estimated that as much as 1 out of every 5 people in the us have one 5 x research source they don t mean that you re stupid or that there s something wrong with you it just means that you learn in a slightly different way common learning disabilities include dyslexia which causes problems with reading if you find that your eyes can t track properly as they move across a page you might have dyslexia dyslexia related disorders like dysgraphia and dyscalculia which cause similar problems with writing and math if you find it difficult to write about something but you can easily talk about it you might have dysgraphia if you have trouble recognizing numbers or doing things like estimating costs you might have dyscalculia central auditory process disorder is another common learning disability which makes it difficult for sufferers to process sounds it s similar to deafness but without any hearing loss and can lead to problems following conversations and focusing when background sounds are present study as soon as possible and as frequently as you can of course the more you study the more you ll learn so studying frequently is a good idea but the sooner you start studying the easier it will also be for you to remember everything this means that you shouldn t start studying two or three days before an exam start work at least a week before an exam and consider just studying continuously throughout the quarter if you feel like you need to it s a good idea to go back over old information at the same time that you go over the information from this week too this will help keep those older ideas and skills fresh in your mind so that you can build on them get help from a tutor or your teacher there s nothing wrong with getting some help and getting expert advice that s tailored to your situation it can seriously help you learn much faster put aside your shyness and your pride and ask your teacher for help if they don t have time to help you they should be able to help you at least find a tutor if you don t have money for a tutor your teacher might be able to set you up with someone in your class who is doing well and can help you out many schools also have free tutoring centers check those out if they re available make a mind map to speed up your studying a mind map is a great way to burn whatever information you re trying to learn straight into your brain a mind map is a visual representation of what you re trying to learn use note cards pictures and sheets of paper to write out facts explanations and organized concepts now pin the items on a wall or lay them out on a floor placing similar items together and using string or other items to indicate linked ideas and subjects study from this map instead of just looking at your notes when you go to take a test or write a paper you ll be able to think back to your mind map and remember the information based on where it was and what it was connected to just like how you can remember where things are on a geographical map memorize efficiently to lock in information fast memorizing isn t always the most foolproof technique but it can help if you need to learn certain kinds of information very quickly memorization works best for lists of things like what order actions should be done in or vocabulary words systematic memorization of more complex material is unlikely to be successful try using mnemonics in order to learn information more quickly mnemonics are phrases or words with act like a key to larger amounts of information for example the mnemonic phrase my very eccentric mother s jazz singing usually nauseates focus on small sections at a time when you re learning and studying it s a good idea to get as comfortable with small sets of information before moving on to new ones you may feel like this goes slower but it s actually faster because you won t need to go back over the information as much this is especially important when you re trying to memorize vocabulary lists and other similar types of information work on sets of words no more than 5 8 at a time before moving on to the next one give yourself context that you find interesting when you have context for information it becomes much easier for you to process when that context is really interesting to you it also makes the information easier to remember do your own research and look for experiences which can help you to contextualize the things you re trying to learn let s say you re trying to learn english try watching a movie that you re interested in that covers a similar subject to the particular area of vocabulary that you re trying to learn at the moment so for example if you re learning travel words try watching lost in translation another example would be if you re trying to study for a history class find a documentary on the subject you re learning about or even one which just shows the country you re studying even just having visuals to go

how to write a critique in five paragraphs,a critique is usually written in response to a creative work such as a novel a film poetry or a painting however critiques are also sometimes assigned for research articles and media items such as news articles or features a critique is slightly different than a traditional 5 paragraph theme as it is usually focused on the overall effectiveness and usefulness of the work it is critiquing rather than making a strictly analytical argument about it organizing your critique into 5 paragraphs can help you structure your thoughts,examine the prompt or assignment be sure you understand exactly what you are being asked to do the assignment may use the word critique or it might use a phrase such as critical assessment critical review or critical evaluation all of these are critique assignments and will require you to not only summarize but evaluate the work you are discussing read the text keep in mind some questions and take notes as you read these will help guide your formulation of your ideas later for example does the creator clearly state her his main point or goal if not why do you think that is who do you think is the creator s intended audience this can be crucial to determining the success of a work for example a movie intended for young children might work well for its intended audience but not for adult viewers what reactions do you have when reading or viewing this work does it provoke emotional responses do you feel confused what questions does the work make you think of does it suggest other avenues of exploration or observation to you do some research you usually will not need to do a lot of research but in order to talk about how the work relates to a larger issue or context you will need to know what it is responding to what context it was created in etc 1 x research source for example if you re critiquing a research article about a new treatment for the flu a little research about other flu treatments currently available could be helpful to you when situating the work in context as another example if you re writing about a movie you might want to briefly discuss the director s other films or other important movies in this particular genre indie action drama etc your school or university library is usually a good place to start when conducting research as their databases provide verified expert sources google scholar can also be a good source for research give the basic information about the work the first paragraph is your introduction to the work and you should give the basic information about it in this paragraph this information will include the author s or creator s name s the title of the work and the date of its creation 2 x research source for a work of fiction or a published work of journalism or research this information is usually available in the publication itself such as on the copyright page for a novel for a film you may wish to refer to a source such as imdb to get the information you need if you re critiquing a famous artwork an encyclopedia of art would be a good place to find information on the creator the title and important dates date of creation date of exhibition etc provide a context for the work the type of context you provide will vary based on what type of work you re evaluating you should aim to give the reader some understanding of what issues the creator or author may have been responding to but you don t need to provide an exhaustive history just give your reader enough information to be able to understand the rest of your critique 3 x research source for example if you re assessing a research article in the sciences a quick overview of its place in the academic discussion could be useful e g professor x s work on fruit flies is part of a long research tradition on blah blah blah if you are evaluating a painting giving some brief information on where it was first displayed for whom it was painted etc would be useful if you are assessing a novel it could be good to talk about what genre or literary tradition the novel is written within e g fantasy high modernism romance you may also want to include details about the author s biography that seem particularly relevant to your critique for a media item such as a news article consider the social and or political context of the media outlet the item came from e g fox news bbc etc and of the issue it is dealing with e g immigration education entertainment summarize the creator s goal or purpose in creating the work this element should consider what the thesis or purpose of the work is sometimes this may be clearly stated such as in a research article for other texts or creative works you may have to formulate what you believe to be the creator s goal or purpose yourself the authors of research articles will often state very clearly in the abstract and in the introduction to their work what they are investigating often with sentences that say something like this in this article we provide a new framework for analyzing x and argue that it is superior to previous methods because of reason a and reason b for creative works you may not have an explicit statement from the author or creator about their purpose but you can often infer one from the context the work occupies for example if you were examining the movie the shining you might argue that the filmmaker stanley kubrick s goal is to call attention to the poor treatment of native americans because of the strong native american themes present in the movie you could then present the reasons why you think that in the rest of the essay summarize the main points of the work describe briefly how the main points are made for example you might talk about a work s use of characters or symbolism to depict its point about society or you could talk about the research questions and hypotheses in a journal article for example if you were writing about the shining you could summarize the main points this way stanley kubrick uses strong symbolism such as the placement of the movie s hotel on an indian burial ground the naming of the hotel overlook and the constant presence of native american artwork and representation to call viewers attention to america s treatment of native americans in history present your initial assessment this will serve as your thesis statement and should make a claim about the work s general effectiveness and or usefulness is your evaluation going to be principally positive negative or mixed 4 x research source for a research article you will probably want to focus your thesis on whether the research and discussion supported the authors claims you may also wish to critique the research methodology if there are obvious flaws present for creative works consider what you believe the author or creator s goal was in making the work and then present your assessment of whether or not they achieved that goal organize your critical evaluations these should form the bulk of your critique and should be a minimum of three paragraphs you can choose to organize your critique differently depending on how you want to approach your critique however you should devote a paragraph to each main topic using the rest of the steps in this section to develop each paragraph s discussion 5 x research source if you have three clear points about your work you can organize each paragraph by point for example if you are analyzing a painting you might critique the painter s use of color light and composition devoting a paragraph to each topic if you have more than three points about your work you can organize each paragraph thematically for example if you are critiquing a movie and want to talk about its treatment of women its screenwriting its pacing its use of color and framing and its acting you might think about the broader categories that these points fall into such as production pacing color and framing screenwriting social commentary treatment of women and performance acting alternatively you could organize your critique by strengths and weaknesses the aim of a critique is not merely to criticize but to point out what the creator or author has done well and what s he has not discuss the techniques or styles used in the work this is particularly important when evaluating creative works such as literature art and music offer your evaluation of how effectively the creator uses the techniques or stylistic choices s he has made to promote her his purpose for example if you are critiquing a song you could consider how the beat or tone of the music supports or detracts from the lyrics for a research article or a media item you may want to consider questions such as how the data was gathered in an experiment or what method a journalist used to discover information explain what types of evidence or argument are used this may be more useful in a critique of a media item or research article consider how the author of the work uses other sources their own evidence and logic in their arguments 6 x research source does the author use primary sources e g historical documents interviews etc secondary sources quantitative data qualitative data are these sources appropriate for the argument has evidence been presented fairly without distortion or selectivity does the argument proceed logically from the evidence used determine what the work adds to the understanding of its topic there are a couple of ways to approach this your goal in this section should be an assessment of the overall usefulness of the work if the work is a creative work consider whether it presents its ideas in an original or interesting way you can also consider whether it engages with key concepts or ideas in popular culture or society if the work is a research article you can consider whether the work enhances your understanding of a particular theory or idea in its discipline research articles often include a section on further research where they discuss the contributions their research has made and what future contributions they hope to make use examples for each point back up your assertions with evidence from your text or work that support your claim about each point for example if you were critiquing a novel and found the writing dull you might provide a particularly boring quotation as evidence and then explain why the writing did not appeal to you state your overall assessment of the work this should be a statement about the overall success of the work did it accomplish the creator s goal or purpose if so how did it achieve this success if not what went wrong summarize your key reasons for this assessment while you should have already presented evidence for your claims in the body paragraphs you should provide a short restatement of your key reasons here this could be as simple as one sentence that says something like because of the researcher s attention to detail careful methodology and clear description of the results this article provides a useful overview of topic x recommend any areas for improvement if appropriate your assignment or prompt will usually say if recommendations are appropriate for the critique this element seems to be more common when critiquing a research article or media item but it could also apply to critiques of creative works as well 7 x research source provide a list of references how you present these will depend on your instructor s preferences and the style mla apa chicago etc that is appropriate to your discipline however you format this list you should always include all the sources you used in your critique,Education-and-Communications

ideas of the original text keep the outline short and to the point ask yourself what is the author trying to say in this text what is the main idea or theme in the text 2 x research source for example if you were using the great gatsby by f scott fitzgerald as the original text you may list several themes or ideas such as friendship social status wealth and unrequited love include several supporting examples from the text once you have the main idea down identify one to three examples from the original text that support the main idea these could be quotes from the text or scenes in the

explores the lives of these two characters have one to three sentences of supporting evidence aim to have one to three supporting points at the most as you do not want to make the summary paragraph too long use events from the text as well as quotes or points in the text to support your opening line 8 x research source for example if you are discussing an article you may use the author s key arguments in the article as supporting points if you are discussing a novel or short story you may use the key events in the story as supporting points use your own words to summarize the original text do not copy or paraphrase the original text use your own words in the summary avoid using the same language or word choice as the original text unless you are quoting it directly 9 x trustworthy

how to develop a curriculum,a curriculum often consists of a guide for educators to teach content and skills some curricula are general road maps while others are quite detailed and give instructions for day to day learning developing a curriculum can be quite challenging especially when expectations have such a large range no matter the situation it is important to start with a general topic and bring in more details with each step finally evaluate your work to see if any changes need to be made,define the purpose of the curriculum your curriculum should have clear topic and purpose the topic should be appropriate for the age of the students and the environment in which the curriculum will be taught 1 x research source if you are asked to design a course ask yourself questions about the general purpose of the course why am i teaching this material what do students need to know what things do they need to learn how to do for example in developing a summer writing course for high school students you ll have to think specifically about what you want the students to get out of the class a possible purpose could be to teach students how to write a one act play even if a topic and course are assigned to you still ask yourself these questions so you have a good understanding of the curriculum s purpose choose an appropriate title depending on the learning objective titling the curriculum may be a straightforward process or one that requires greater thought a curriculum for ged students can be called ged preparation curriculum a program designed to assist adolescents with eating disorders might require a carefully thought out title that is attractive to teenagers and sensitive to their needs establish a timeline talk to your supervisor about how much time you will have to teach the course some courses last a full year and others last only one semester if you are not teaching in a school find out how much time is allotted to your classes once you have a timeline you can begin to organize your curriculum into smaller sections figure out how much you can cover in the time allotted use your knowledge of your students age ability etc and your knowledge of the content to get a sense of how much information you will be able to cover in the time you were given you do not need to plan activities just yet but you can start to think about what is possible 2 x research source consider how often you will see the students classes that meet once or twice per week may have a different outcome than classes that meet every day for example imagine that you are writing a theater curriculum the difference between a two hour class that meets once a week for three weeks and a two hour class that meets every day for three months is significant in those three weeks you might be able to put on a 10 minute play three months on the other hand may be enough time for a full production this step may not apply to all teachers grade schools often follow state standards that outline the topics that need to be covered over the course of the year students often take tests at the end of the year so there is much more pressure to cover all the standards brainstorm a list of desired outcomes make a list of the content you want your students to learn and what they should be able to do by the end of the course it will later be important to have clear objectives that outline the skills and knowledge your students will acquire without these objectives you will not be able to evaluate students or the efficacy of the curriculum 3 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source for example in your summer playwriting course you might want students to learn how to write a scene develop well rounded characters and create a storyline teachers working in public schools in the united states are expected to follow government standards most states have adopted the common core state standards which explain exactly what students should be able to do by the end of the school year from grades k 12 4 x research source consult existing curricula for inspiration 5 x research source check online for curricula or standards that have been developed in your subject area if you are working in a school check with other teachers and supervisors about curricula from previous years having a sample to work from makes developing your own curriculum much easier for example if you re teaching a playwriting class you could do an online search for playwriting class curriculum or playwriting course standards make a template curricula are usually graphically organized in a way that includes a space for each component some institutions ask educators to use a standardized template so find out what is expected of you if no template is provided find one online or create your own template this will help you keep your curriculum organized and presentable identify the unit titles within the curriculum 6 x research source units or themes are the main topics that will be covered in the curriculum organize your brainstorm or state standards into unified sections that follow a logical sequence units can cover big ideas like love planets or equations and important topics like multiplication or chemical reactions 7 x research source the number of units varies by curriculum and they can last anywhere between one week and eight weeks a unit title can be one word or a short sentence a unit about character development for example could be called creating deep characters create learning goals for each unit learning goals are the specific things that students will know and be able to do by the end of the unit you already gave this some thought when you first brainstormed ideas for the class now you have to be more specific as you write your learning goals keep important questions in mind what does the state require students to know how do i want my students to think about this topic what will my students be able to do 8 x research source often you can pull learning goals right from common core standards 9 x research source use swbat students will be able to if you get stuck try starting each learning goal with students will be able to this works for both skills and content knowledge for example students will be able to provide a two page written analysis of the reasons behind the civil war this requires students to both know information causes of the civil war and do something with the information written analysis write essential questions for each unit every unit needs 2 4 general questions that should be explored throughout the unit essential questions guide students to understand the more important parts of the theme essential questions are often big complex questions that can t always be answered in one lesson 10 x research source for example an essential question for a middle school unit about fractions might be why doesn t using division always make things smaller an essential question for a unit on character development might be how does a person s decisions and actions reveal aspects of their personality prepare appropriate learning experiences once you have an organized set of units you can begin to think about what kinds of materials content and experiences students will need in order to gain an understanding of each theme this can be covered by the textbook you will use texts you plan to read projects discussions and trips 11 x research source keep your audience in mind remember that there are many ways for students to acquire skills and knowledge try to choose books multimedia and activities that will engage the population you are working with include a plan for assessments to evaluate it students need to be evaluated on their performance this helps the student know if they were successful in understanding the content and it helps the teacher know if they were successful in delivering the content additionally assessments help the teacher determine if any changes need to be made to the curriculum in the future there are many ways to assess student performance and assessments should be present throughout each unit use formative assessments formative assessments are usually smaller more informal assessments that provide feedback on the learning process so you can make changes to the curriculum throughout the unit although formative assessments are usually a part of the daily lesson plan they can also be included in the unit descriptions examples include journal entries quizzes collages or short written responses 12 x research source include summative assessments summative assessments occur once a full topic has been covered these assessments are appropriate for the end of a unit or at the end of the course examples of summative assessments are tests presentations performances papers or portfolios 13 x research source these assessments range from touching on specific details to answering essential questions or discussing larger themes use the curriculum to plan lessons lesson planning is usually separate from the curriculum development process although many teachers do write their own curricula this is not always the case sometimes the person who wrote the curriculum is not the same person who will teach it either way make sure you that what is outlined in the curriculum is used to guide lesson planning 14 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source transfer the necessary information from your curriculum to your lesson plan include the name of the unit the essential questions and the unit goal that you are working on during the lesson ensure that lesson objectives lead students to reach the unit goals lesson objectives also called aims goals or swbat are similar to unit goals but must be more specific remember that students should be able to complete the objective by the end of the lesson for example students will be able to explain four causes of the civil war is specific enough that it can be tackled in one lesson teach and observe the lessons once you ve developed the curriculum put it into action you won t know if it is working until you try it out with real teachers and real students be aware of how students respond to the topics teaching methods assessments and lessons 15 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source make revisions reflect on how the students respond to the material this can happen in the middle of the course or once it has already finished revisions are important especially since standards technology and students are always changing 16 x research source ask key questions when you revise the curriculum are the students reaching the learning goals are they able to answer the essential questions are students meeting state standards are students prepared for the learning beyond your class if not consider making revisions the content teaching styles and sequence you can revise any aspect of the curriculum but everything must be aligned remember that any revisions you make to general topics need to be reflected in the other areas for example if you change a unit topic remember to write new essential questions objectives and assessments 17 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to

thanksgiving spice up your holiday menu by introducing some bold new flavors keep your paragraphs short you don t want to lose your reader after you ve hooked them since long dense paragraphs can look overwhelming it s a good idea to keep them on the shorter side paragraphs of about 3 4 sentences look visually appealing and can keep your reader interested 7 x research source make sure to only include 1 idea in each paragraph so that your reader can more easily absorb the information for example don t try to talk about side dishes and table decor in 1 paragraph those are 2 separate ideas include a story to draw your reader in add some life to your article by including some interesting facts or a touching story if you just state your opinion or a list of instructions that probably won t be very interesting if you re writing an article about zoning laws in your town you could interview a small business owner and write about how the changes could impact them 8 x research source for your thanksgiving article you could write about certain foods that remind you of the thanksgiving you celebrated while studying abroad make sure to include substance so that your reader learns something interesting stories are great but you need to also include useful information look back over your research notes and choose the most relevant information for example if you re writing about thanksgiving dinner don t forget to include tips on what to serve how long it will take and how to make each item don t feel like you have to include everything though use discretion and make good choices you don t need to give recipes for 5 different types of pie make sure to cite your sources 9 x research source don t just tell your readers about how much you love serving a vegetarian thanksgiving dinner give them concrete examples of how they can wow their guests leave out any fluff while you might have a charming anecdote about your child dressing up like a turkey for school that s probably not what your readers are looking for stick to the topic at hand even when it comes to personal stories stick to a word limit to avoid rambling if you ve been assigned an article you ve likely already been given a word limit all you have to do is make sure to stick to it if you re writing a blog or another type of article you might need to set your own parameters a good rule of thumb is that articles should be around 500 words for blogs or how to articles of course if you re writing a scholarly article it can be much longer 10 x research source come back later if you experience writer s block writing is hard and creating something good can take time if you find yourself struggling to find the right word or turn of phrase take a break go for a walk or get a snack this will

how to make a questionnaire,when a company non profit group or politician needs to find out how their stakeholders or constituents feel they often create and implement a questionnaire the results can lead to re branding decision making and policy changes if the feedback is sound making a questionnaire can seem very straightforward but unless it is designed properly the results can be skewed and unreliable,decide what you want to learn from administering your questionnaire 1 x research source ask yourself what data you require and how you will use it this will help you come up with useful questions as well as the order in which you will ask them plan questions that will help you get the information you need begin with a broad span of questions then narrow them down until each one relates to your goals in some way keep questions and answers simple using as few words as possible you may want to rely on open ended questions closed ended questions or a mix of the two use closed ended questions to gather specific answers closed ended questions have a specific range of options respondents can choose from 2 x research source these questions may be yes or no questions true or false questions or questions that ask the respondent to agree or disagree with a statement closed ended questions may look like open ended questions but will have only a few options respondents can use to answer closed ended questions might look like these have you shopped here before if so how often do you shop here this question would have a few explicit answers from which respondents could choose once a week to once a month for instance how satisfied were you with your experience today likewise this question would have limited responses very satisfied to very dissatisfied would you recommend this store to a friend use open ended questions to solicit feedback open ended questions solicit answers that you may not anticipate and do not have a specific range of answers to choose from open ended questions are a chance for respondents to communicate their specific experience or expectations such questions might look like these how will you use your purchase where else do you normally shop who referred you to this store open ended questions are good for clarifying a previous answer why do you feel this way ask questions in such a way as to avoid confusion and bias avoid leading questions especially leading questions indicate that the asker is looking for a certain answer and will limit what answers your responders are comfortable supplying either tailor possible answers or change the wording of your question so as to avoid leading your respondents to answer in a particular way questions should be worded so as to maximize clarity confused respondents will skew your data so questions should be as understandable as possible avoid double negatives unnecessary clauses or unclear subject object relationships think about how you will deliver your questionnaire there are many options open to you you may use an online service to design your questionnaire you can then send links to your questionnaire over e mail you may use a phone or mail campaign to cold call respondents or you can execute a campaign in person using professionals or volunteers to lead surveys design your questionnaire according to your delivery method there are advantages and disadvantages to each method and each method has limits on what you can do ask yourself which delivery method best suits the subject matter of your questionnaire as well as the data you want to receive for instance surveys delivered on the computer by phone and by mail can reach a broad range of people whereas surveys administered in person are time intensive and limits who can participate which may be useful surveys delivered on the computer in person and by mail can utilize pictures whereas phone interviews cannot respondents may be too shy to answer certain questions in person or by phone decide if you want to give clarifications to your questions if the respondent doesn t understand something only interviews given by a live person can deliver clarifications a computer survey will require the respondent to have access to a computer if your questionnaire concerns private issues a computer survey may work best 4 x research source consider the order of your questions the form of your questionnaire matters just as much as its content you should aim to order questions so that they follow each other logically or mark clear shifts from section to section other kinds of questions may impact how a respondent fills out the questionnaire qualifiers are questions that screen certain respondents out preventing them from completing other questions position these at the beginning of your questionnaire if demographics are of major concern ask demographic questions up front save personal or complicated questions for the end of the questionnaire respondents will not feel as overwhelmed by these questions and may be more likely to be open and honest decide if you will offer incentives for completing the questionnaire it s often easier to attract respondents if you offer something in return for their time online mail or phone questionnaires could offer a coupon after questionnaire completion in person questionnaires could offer merchandise in exchange for participation questionnaires are also a good way to attract attention to mailing lists or membership offers which may otherwise go unnoticed by respondents test your questionnaire before you begin surveying people friends employees and family members can be good testers you may have them try your questionnaire while it s still in development or you may have them test a finished draft ask your testers for feedback they may alert you to sections that confused them or felt out of place user impressions about the questionnaire are just as important as the actual questionnaire after you test do some number crunching to ensure you are collecting the data you need if you are not getting the information you want adjust the questionnaire you may need to reword some things add introductions or rearrange add or delete questions so your questionnaire leads you toward your goals review your data to understand what your questionnaire was really asking remember that a questionnaire is often part of a larger campaign they can be altered and reused multiple times in order to target different demographics ask different questions or better align with your goals after reviewing your results you may find that though your questions make sense they aren t quite the right ones you need to achieve your goals for instance you may find that a question such as how often do you shop here limits your demographic to those who shop at a brick and mortar store if you want to see how people purchase a specific product you may want to broaden your question to include online shopping your implementation method may also be limiting your data for instance surveys administered online may be answered largely by respondents with higher than average computer knowledge further revise your questions some of your questions may work during testing but may not work as well out in the field your questions must make sense to the specific demographic you are targeting ask yourself if your respondents are truly understanding what is being asked or if your survey is so standard that respondents are not responding thoughtfully for instance a question such as why do you shop here may be too broad a question which could mislead your respondents if you want to know if the store s decor has an impact on shopping habits you could instead ask respondents to describe how they feel about the store s decor branding etc review your open ended questions see if your open ended questions are working the way you need them to work they may be too open in which case respondents may ramble they may not be open enough in which case the data you received won t be as valuable ask yourself what role your open ended questions are playing in your questionnaire and tailor them as needed as above broad questions such as how do you feel while shopping here may not give your respondents enough direction you could instead ask would you recommend this store to your friends why or why not decide how you will respond to missing data not all respondents will answer all questions which may or may not be a problem for you 5 x research source ask yourself which questions are being skipped or answered incompletely if at all this may be due to the order of the questions the wording of the questions or the subject matter of the questions if missing data is important consider rewording skipped questions to make them more or less specific review what sort of feedback you are receiving see if you have unusual trends in your data and decide if this reflects reality or if this is due to a flaw in your questionnaire for instance your closed question answers will limit the sort of information your respondents can give you your answers may be so limited as to make strong opinions look the same as weak opinions or may not provide for a full range of reasonable answers for instance if you are asking respondents to rate an experience you should provide them with the option to respond with very dissatisfied as well as very satisfied and many options in between,Education-and-Communications

without stopping and reduces the chances of you getting distracted decide who to study with with such a limited amount of time it is probably best to study alone however it is sometimes helpful to work with a small group in order to compare notes and talk through concepts together 1 x research source if you decide a study group will help you make sure to choose classmates who are at least as smart as you so they don t slow you down be careful of studying with friends it is easy to get distracted if you are only studying with good friends make sure your study group has some members that you only know from class 2 x research source review your notes if you don t have your own make sure to have a copy of the notes from someone who you trust re reading your notes is important but it is not enough go over and highlight key words and concepts or use post its to signify important sections try writing summaries of your notes for each chapter or major concept 3 x research source write them in the simplest terms on a separate piece of paper these summaries can help guide your study day read your notes out of order as you review them this will allow you to make sure you know each piece of information on its own rather than part of a series say it out loud make sure you are saying the information out loud as you review it it will be easier to remember if your brain is hearing and pronouncing and not merely reading the information try teaching a chapter or concept to an imaginary student 4 x research source this will force you to fully articulate the subject it will be clear whether or not you have a handle on the material if you try to explain it to someone else you can also do this with a study group or partner use memorization tricks as you prepare lots of last minute memorization it will be helpful if you use some memorization techniques re writing information over and over again may help it stick in your brain make sure to copy the fact or idea at least three times for this method to work use mnemonic devices mnemonic devices are techniques that help your brain retain information creating rhymes acronyms and songs that you can associate with the material will help you recall it make flash cards write terms and their full definitions on a set of notecards or cue cards this will allow you to test yourself throughout the day they are also useful on the day of the test as you can review them on the bus or in line for lunch 5 x research source use your textbook effectively simply re reading your textbook will not help you retain information especially when you only have one day to study look for chapter summaries and bolded keywords as you review and pay attention to chapter introductions and conclusions as they usually contain essential summarizing information look for review questions at the end of chapters or in the back of your textbook it is important to be testing yourself whenever possible to better gauge what you still need to work on create a study guide a study guide is an effective way to force you to review all your material it can also be useful to look over the day of the test for a quick refresher type out a list of all the material you need to cover including key terms dates and concepts next go back and fill in each area using your notes either typed or handwritten putting these ideas into your own words and writing them out will really help cement them in your mind a friend or classmate may have created their own study guide which you might be tempted to borrow when you are short on time however the act of creating your own study guide will force you to put the information into your own words and copying out the material will help it stick in your mind study for the test you are taking even with a time crunch you need to make sure you prepare properly for the test depending on the format that it takes refer to the syllabus or your class notes to establish what format the test will take if you are unsure be sure to contact a classmate so you are studying for the right thing for multiple choice tests questions will usually be geared towards smaller details and facts as well as vocabulary and definitions there may also be questions about sequences and steps questions that ask about the similarities and differences between things are also common on multiple choice tests while it may be difficult to memorize all the tiny details with a limited amount of time focus on specific areas rather than attempting to conquer the entire subject 6 x research source for essay or short answer tests you will be asked to have a good understanding of wide themes and ideas try preparing a few sample questions based on the textbook and syllabus time yourself for 15 minutes and write out a detailed outline for each question as if you were going to turn it into a full essay be sure to memorize some key terms and examples that you can use for support in your essay questions during the actual test know exactly what is being covered make sure you re clear about what you are being tested on this may include date ranges specific scientific theories or mathematic equations if you are unsure as a classmate to verify what material you are being tested on this is essential to your success especially with such little time to lose make a schedule 7 x research source divide up the hours in the day and decide what you will focus on when make sure you allow yourself time to sleep make a list of everything you need to know review the syllabus or any handouts given to you by your teacher figure out exactly what is being covered and create your own list of the material you need to review take lots of breaks make sure that you are allowing yourself frequent breaks so that you do not burn out consider working for 45 minutes and then taking a 15 minute break during your break feel free to check your email use your phone or get up and walk around one way of creating a break schedule for yourself is the 50 10 method study diligently for 50 minutes without distractions hold yourself accountable if you stop or get distracted restart the 50 minutes once you have had a completely undistracted 50 minutes go on a 10 minute break this will force you to be much more productive when you are studying establish major concepts create a list of the major theoretical or categorical concepts and make sure you understand them as you are studying last minute it is most important that you understand the largest concepts first 8 x research source while you may be tested on small details it is first important to grasp the large theories in order to give yourself a context for the smaller facts organize terms and facts according to these larger groupings this is a technique called chunking it is easier to memorize individual concepts when you are putting them in relationship to a greater whole review your syllabus usually your teacher hands out a syllabus at the beginning of the year or semester detailing all the material that will be covered in the course refer back to the syllabus to ensure that you have not missed any areas of study you can also use the syllabus to guide your study there is a good chance that your professor organized the material in a specific way to guide your learning use the syllabus to help you find ways to look at the course

how to quote in a research paper,a research paper can be made stronger through the use of quotations you may use quotes when you need to cite a key piece of primary source material strengthen your argument through another writer s work or highlight a term of art it is important to both use quotations effectively and cite them properly to write an effective paper and avoid plagiarizing,understand how to use dropped quotes dropped quotes are partial phrases taken from the middle of a piece of text dropped quotes are comprised of only a few words and give no information about the speaker these must always be introduced within a sentence and cannot comprise a complete sentence on their own use a complete sentence to incorporate a dropped quote ex as rembrandt s skill developed he began painting landscapes that are romantic and visionary wallace 96 use a short phrase to incorporate a dropped quote rembrandt s landscapes are romantic and visionary wallace 96 understand how to use full sentence quotes as the name implies full sentence quotes are created by quoting complete sentences that take up less than 4 lines although these are complete sentences they cannot be used as stand alone sentences in your paper introduce them with an additional complete sentence or a signal phrase use a complete sentence to introduce a full sentence quote ex over the course of time rembrandt s work began to change and focus on different themes but as wallace points out rembrandt s great gift as an etcher lay in preserving a sense of spontaneity while scrupulously attending to close detail 142 use a signal phrase to introduce your full sentence quote ex as wallace states rembrandt s great gift as an etcher lay in preserving a sense of spontaneity while scrupulously attending to close detail 142 understand how to use block quotes block quotes are multiple sentences quoted directly from a source which take up more than 4 lines in your paper or no more than 3 if you are quoting verse 1 x trustworthy source purdue online writing lab trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines go to source because these take up a lot of physical space they should be used sparingly with a maximum of 1 2 for a complete paper incorporate a block quote by adding a complete line space between your own content and the quote and offsetting it by indenting the entire quote to the right a single time introduce your block quote with a colon ex according to wallace add a line break here and then indent the entire quote block quotes do not use quotation marks you have already stated who the author is what is being referred to in the introduction sentence add the in text parenthetical citation after the period at the end of the quote though if your block quote is inside a paragraph you don t have to start a new paragraph at the end of it simply add another line break and begin writing along the left margin with no indent 2 x research source however you will need to indent the second paragraph by an extra 0 25 in 0 64 cm if you are citing more than 1 paragraph 3 x trustworthy source purdue online writing lab trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines go to source understand how to use indirect quotes indirect quoting or paraphrasing is when you use a sentence from a source but change the wording slightly into your own words this is useful when you cannot meet rubric requirements by quoting or if you ve quoted too much be careful to avoid plagiarism though by changing at least 50 of the sentence change the structure of the sentence by moving clauses around aim to change at least half of the sentence into a new structure but also make sure that the grammar is correct and the meaning of the sentence is still clear you can use a thesaurus to exchange words with synonyms paraphrasing should only be done if you are certain that you understand the content you are copying if you are unclear as to the meaning of the quote you won t be able to put it adequately into your own words when you write your paraphrase don t look at the quote keep the meaning in your head and create a new sentence to match 4 x research source know where to place commas and periods when you re placing a quote inside your essay you ll likely have to use a comma or period at the end if you re quoting without giving a citation because your entire essay is about a single work for example commas and periods go inside the quotations marks if you ve included a parenthetical citation the comma or period goes outside the quotation marks after the citation to use a comma you might structure the quote with in sentence like this yogurt provides beneficial bacteria to your gut so it is good to include 1 serving per day in your diet to use a period you might structure the quote like this carrots are a valuable source of vitamin a know where to place exclamation points and question marks if there is an exclamation point or question mark inside the quote you are using keep it inside the quotation marks if you re asking a question or exclaiming the importance of a quote add the punctuation outside of the quotation marks if you are asking a question about a quoted question use a single question mark inside the quotations example of a quotation that comes with a question mark alice said but where will i go 24 example of asking a question about a quotation with so much contention will literary scholars ever agree on the dream like quality of alice s adventure 39 example of a question about a quoted question at this point in the story readers communally ask but where will i go 24 use ellipses correctly when you use the majority of but not all of a quote or if you begin in the middle of a quote it is necessary to insert ellipses these show that some of the sentence is not included in your quote use to show that a part of the quote before or after your selection has been excluded ellipses can be used in the center of a quote to leave out words that you feel add unnecessary length to the statement without adding value for example as the man stated reading the book was enlightening and life changing this is done rather than as the man stated reading the book over the last few weeks was not only incredibly enjoyable but also enlightening and life changing ellipses should be used only before or after a quote not both if you are only use a part of a quote from the center of a selection it is just a partial or dropped quote however keep in mind that ellipses rarely come at the beginning of a quotation 5 x research source use brackets correctly the opposite of ellipses used to leave something out brackets are inserted into a quote to add information that you deem important necessary but which is not included in the quote itself you can include brackets in a quote to give a few words typically the name of a person or place that the quote is focusing on to help the reader understand the context for example as scholars have noted rembrandt s portrait of her henrickje his mistress was both accurate and emotion filled wallace 49 use colons and semicolons correctly if you are using a colon or semicolon after a quote or there is a colon or semicolon at the end of your selection which you are quoting place the punctuation mark outside of the quotation marks 6 x research source copy the quote exactly if you are using a direct quote it is imperative that you copy it word for word include all spelling and grammatical mistakes as well even if you are aware they are incorrect if your quote has a mistake that you are aware of put sic italicized and in brackets immediately after the mistake this signifies that you are aware that there is a mistake in the quote and that it is not a mistake on your part ex as dormer has noted his work is much more valuable now then sic it was at the time of its creation quote in mla format when citing in mla format your in text citation should include the author s name and the page number that the information is from you can include these together in a parenthetical citation or you can mention one in your writing and the other in a parenthetical citation ex we can therefore ascertain that rembrandt s decline in popularity may have been his dedication to biblical painting wallace 112 ex according to some another reason for rembrandt s decline in popularity may have been his dedication to biblical painting wallace 112 but not everyone agree on this matter ex wallace states that another reason for rembrandt s decline in popularity may have been his dedication to biblical painting 112 7 x research source quote in apa format slightly different than mla format apa requires an in text parenthetical citation with the author s last name and the year the text was published they must be included together in the parentheses or you can mention the name of the author in your writing and put just the year in parentheses afterwards 8 x research source ex as billy s character is described we learn billy wasn t a catholic even though he grew up with a ghastly crucifix on his wall vonnegut 1969 ex vonnegut gives a factual statement with a clear opinion thrown in when he says billy wasn t a catholic even though he grew up with a ghastly crucifix on his wall 1969 ex with the knowledge that billy wasn t a catholic even though he grew up with a ghastly crucifix on his wall vonnegut 1969 we begin to understand his philosophical standings quote in chicago style the chicago style of formatting research essays uses footnotes at the bottom of your page rather than in text parenthetical citations in order to cite a quotation in your paper add a footnote number immediately after the ending quotation mark not inside the quotes this should be paired with a matching citation at the bottom of the page 9 x research source choose the quotations you want to use in the paper with care overuse of quotations is considered sloppy in academic writing because it relies too heavily on others to make your point show not only that can you write but that you can also judiciously sift through large amounts of research to glean the most important quotes that will support your argument avoid summarizing if you re quoting something directly it should be done because you have valuable insights based on that particular phrase or set of information quotes should not be used as filler followed by a long summary or paraphrase of what you copied make sure that when you discuss the quote you aren t simply repeating what the text says in different words 10 x research source use quotes to highlight a specific phrase often times in academic writing a very specific phrase or term may be used and described by an empirical source if there is no way for your to better explain or reword this phrase use a quotation when possible try to paraphrase or use an indirect quote to avoid seeming lazy with your writing quote important evidence quotations can be particularly helpful for an argumentative or study based research paper as you can use them to provide direct evidence for an important point you are making add oomph to your position by quoting someone who also backs it with good reason be sure to elaborate on their point after quoting though rather than just dropping it into your essay without further discussion be clear when using quotes although helpful at times quotes that have not been clearly attributed can be confusing and out of place make sure your quote is given context before stating it although you should have a citation involved as well it is important to make it clear to the reader that the ideas you are presenting are those of someone else include bibliographic information at the end of the paper a works cited page or other bibliographic source page is used at the end of the paper to list full publishing information on each quoted source,Education-and-Communications

how to evaluate the credibility of a source,we are constantly surrounded by information and it is not always easy to know which sources to trust being able to evaluate the credibility of information is an important skill used in school work and day to day life with so much advertising controversy and blogging going on how do you sift through the chaff and cut to the chase,understand academic standards scholarly writers are held to a higher standard of rigor than casual writers and even some branches of journalism as such you must hold your sources to a higher standard as well citing information from an unreliable source makes academic audiences wary of your entire argument because it is based on information held to a lower level of integrity academics have a long memory too many transgressions into the land of unreliable sources and you ll be a marked writer with a marred reputation consider the author s scholarly reputation 1 x research source petersen alexander michael et al reputation and impact in academic careers pnas proceedings of the national academy of sciences of the united states of america 111 43 2014 15316 15321 psycinfo web 2 mar 2015 within each field there are a handful of scholarly thinkers considered the giants of the discipline for example in literary theory jacques lacan jacques derrida and michel foucalt are three towering figures whose work provides the bedrock of the discipline citing them would go a long way toward establishing your credibility as a scholar within the field this is not to say that less established scholars work is not credible sometimes citing a scholar who goes against the tide of established thinking provides you with ammunition for a compelling devil s advocate argument in academia these types of arguments are sometimes more valued than those based on the writings of famous thinkers because they suggest you have the ability to question accepted thinking and push the boundaries of the discipline be aware of any credibility scandals that may have befallen even well established academics for example critical theorist slavoj žižek s reputation and credibility has been significantly damaged after a 2014 accusation of plagiarism 2 x research source focus on scholarly peer reviewed sources these sources should be your first avenue of research when undertaking an academic project they have the highest possible level of credibility and you can always feel safe using them there are two elements to unpack for this designation scholarly and peer reviewed scholarly sources are written by experts in a particular discipline for other experts in their field they are written to inform not entertain and assume a high level of previous knowledge because they are written specifically to people who have a vested professional interest in technical information relevant to their specialization peer reviewed articles are not only written by experts but are also read and evaluated by a panel of peers other experts in the field this panel of experts determines whether or not the sources used in the article were credible whether the methodologies used in studies are scientifically sound and render a professional opinion as to whether or not an article meets the academic standard of integrity only then will an article be published in a scholarly peer reviewed journal almost all peer reviewed journals require a subscription fee however if you have an active edu email account from a university where you either attend or work you can make use of the library s subscriptions to databases to access these journals using the library website s database search engine use the advanced search to restrict your search results to peer reviewed sources use discretion with all websites if you are using any online source other than a scholarly university database you should exercise caution because anyone can publish their thoughts on the internet regardless of the merit of those thoughts as a general rule all gov websites are credible because they have the weight of governmental institutions behind them websites that end in com and org are sometimes credible but sometimes not in these cases you need to look at the institution or organization that is producing the information a private individual does not have the credibility needed for academic work however a large established organization like the american medical association or the centers for disease control and prevention do there are large famous organizations that are still known to have biases for example people for the ethical treatment of animals will provide only that information which supports their cause whereas the u s fish and wildlife services might provide the same family of information without agenda bias websites that end in edu also fall into the category of sometimes credible individual faculty often provide course websites that include information pertinent to classes they teach these sites may include lecture materials and interpretation of sources while faculty at a university are reputable this information does not go through the peer review process discussed earlier as such you should be more cautious with it if at all possible look for that same information from a peer reviewed source rather than a professor s personal edu source avoid self published material at all costs if an author is unable to convince a publisher to house their ideas it s likely because their ideas carry little weight never cite an author who self published their work distinguish between scholarly and non scholarly books if an author has had their manuscript accepted for publication that means that someone has deemed their ideas worthy of discussion however there is a significant and important difference between books published for scholarly and non scholarly purposes scholarly books are written with the sole purpose of informing they offer new ideas criticize old ones and present new data or theories relevant to an audience of academic scholars non scholarly books might deal with scholarly subject matter sociology for example or politics however they are written to entertain a lay audience not to inform a scholarly audience scholarly books are often published by university presses amherst college press and professional associations american historical association whereas non scholarly articles are published by commercial publishers houghton mifflin 3 x research source scholarly books will provide an extensive list of references to bolster their academic credibility whereas non scholarly books often make claims without any credible referential support avoid using textbooks except for background information textbooks are wonderful teaching aids they condense technical information into easily understandable language for students who are learning that material for the first time however they include only that information that is accepted by consensus within a field as such you should not rely on such obvious to academics in the field information to create the main thrust of your academic argument use information from a textbook only for the background information necessary to build the foundation for your more innovative argument consider the timeliness of the source scholarship is a continually evolving body of knowledge and information that is once groundbreaking may be proven incorrect or outdated within a few years or even months always check the date of publication for a source before making a decision about whether or not it is reliable information for your project for example as recently as the 1960s most scholarly linguists believed african american vernacular english to be a deficient broken form of standard american english reflective of african americans lack of cognitive abilities by the 1980s and 90s the majority of linguists had come to embrace african american vernacular english as a distinct dialectical variation of american english with its own patterned grammatical structures and diction 4 x research source snell julia dialect interaction and class positioning at school from deficit to difference to repertoire language amp education an international journal 27 2 2013 110 128 communication amp mass media complete web 2 mar 2015 the entire line of thinking reversed itself within a couple decades use unacceptable sources and methods in an acceptable way so far we have discussed many types of sources that are unacceptable for scholarly writing many websites non scholarly books etc however there are ways to use those types of sources to your benefit without citing them students are always told never use wikipedia that s true you should never cite wikipedia for multiple reasons it s written anonymously so you can t know the credibility of the author and it s continually updated so it s not a stable source however if you find information that you find useful that information may be cited in a more reputable footnote if the cited source meets the other standards for credibility read that source and cite it use wikipedia as a starting point that points you toward better sources do the same for any other websites that don t meet the high standard for academic integrity if you cannot find that information corroborated in scholarly sources that s a red flag that the information is not trustworthy and you should not include it in your argument seek a second opinion if you are belong to a college community in some way as student faculty staff or alumnus check with the english department to see if you have access to a university writing studio the staff at the writing studio will be able to provide you with a professional opinion on the credibility of a given source if you are a student show the source to your professor and ask for their advice in evaluating it always seek your second opinion ahead of the deadline for your project if one or more of your sources proves problematic you will find yourself deleting sections of your paper and scrambling for new sources at the last second evaluate the professionalism of production generally the more time and money that is invested into the creation and publishing of the material the more likely you are to find reliable information a poorly designed website or pamphlet or a site that is covered in unsightly advertisements and pop ups is not likely to provide information from an individual or organization invested in preserving their reputation or image look for high end professional finishes to websites and print publications note that this does not mean that all information found in well packaged sources is credible templates for well designed websites are inexpensive and easily available research the author a source is more credible if written by someone with a degree or other credentials in the subject of interest if no author or organization is named the source should not be considered highly credible however if the author is presenting original work evaluate the merit of the ideas not the credentials credentials have never guaranteed innovation and the history of science tells us that the big advances in sciences tend to come from outsiders not the establishment some questions that you should ask about the author are where does the author work if the author is affiliated with a reputable institution or organization what are its values and goals do they benefit financially by promoting a particular view what is his or her educational background what other works has the author published what experience does the author have is s he an innovator or a follower and promoter of the status quo has this author been cited as a source by other scholars or experts in the field in the case of an anonymous author you can check who published the website with http whois domaintools com it will tell you who registered the domain name and when how many other domains they have an email address to reach the person or organization as well as the mailing address check the date find out when the source was published or revised in some subject areas such as the sciences having current sources is essential but in other fields like the humanities including older material is critical it s also possible that you re looking at an older version of the source and an updated one has since been published check with a scholarly database for academic sources or an online bookstore for popular sources to see if a more recent version is available if so not only should you find it but you can also feel more confident about the source the more printings or editions the more reliable the information investigate the publisher the institution housing the information can often tell you a great deal about how credible that information is for example you should feel more comfortable trusting information found in the new york times or the washington post two newspapers with proven track records of journalistic integrity and public retraction of errors than that found in a source like infowars which has a wide readership but often publishes misleading or blatantly incorrect information 5 x research source determine the intended audience scan the document in question for tone depth and breadth before absorbing the information in it are those three elements appropriate for your project 2 using a source that is too specialized and technical for your needs may lead you to misinterpret the information given which is just as hurtful to your own credibility as using an unreliable source check the reviews you should make use of resources like book review index book review digest and periodical abstracts to determine how and why others have criticized the source if there is significant controversy surrounding the validity of the source you may wish to avoid using it or examine it further with a skeptical eye evaluate the source s sources citing other reliable sources is a sign of credibility it is however sometimes necessary to verify that the other sources also show a pattern of credibility and are used in context identify bias if the source s author is known to be emotionally or financially connected with the subject be aware that the source may not fairly represent all views sometimes research is necessary to determine relationships that indicate the possibility of bias look up the author and the publishing institution to see if they have been accused of biased work in the past be conscious of wording that indicates judgment conclusions that describe something as bad or good or right or wrong should be examined critically it is more appropriate to compare something to an objective standard than to label it with words that represent abstract concepts for example these and other illegal acts is preferable to these and other despicable acts the former describes the acts in terms of the law an objective source whereas the second example judges the actions according to the author s own belief of what is a despicable act evaluate consistency sources that apply different standards to those who agree and disagree with them are suspect if your source praises one politician for changing to meet the needs of his constituency but criticizes an opposing politician for changing his position with opinion polls then it is likely that the source is biased investigate the financial or funding sources for sponsored research determine the sources of funding for the work to get an idea of the potential influences on it various sources of funding can sway the information presented or the way a study is conducted in order to align with their own agendas for example the bmj formerly the british medical journal banned all tobacco research funded by tobacco companies in 2013 because they determined that the special interests of the research funders would lead to biased unreliable conclusions 6 x research

how to stop arguing with someone in your head,have you ever gotten upset after a drawn out argument with someone only to eventually realize that the whole disagreement only took place in your head it s perfectly normal to rehearse difficult conversations ahead of time and it can actually be a great way to work out exactly what you want to say however if these imagined arguments are happening frequently or they re very intense it may help to practice a few techniques that will help you express yourself more calmly during a real conversation,set aside a specific time for hypothetical arguments playing out arguments in your head can often make you feel emotional or angry which can sometimes derail your whole day if you find that happening often it can help to designate a specific time during the day for these imagined conversations that way if you catch yourself getting wrapped up in one you can pause it and remind yourself that there s time for that later 1 x research source

a specific time of day just for worrying think through the whole conversation when you re ready to work through the argument sit down and let the whole conversation play out allow yourself to think through your responses to what you imagine the other person would say or come up with retorts to things they actually did say during your last argument as you do that though try to focus on the underlying thoughts and feelings that are upsetting you rather than just trying to craft a devastating insult 2 x research source for instance if you keep replaying the time a coworker implied you re not good at your job you might think about why that really hurts are you insecure about your ability to do your job or maybe bothered because you don t feel like you re recognized at work name your emotions to yourself as they arise pay attention to the feelings that come up as you play through the argument and try to label them naming your emotions can help you understand them better which might help you feel like you re better in control of them 3 x research source for example if you re replaying a conversation where you were having a hard time getting your point across you might say something like i feel frustrated that i wasn t able to explain myself or i felt anxious during that argument you might notice reactions in your body too like i m feeling unheard and my face is burning 4 x research source don t judge your emotions they re not good or bad even if they re positive or negative emotions your feelings are normal and understanding them can help you figure out how to move forward write down your thoughts in a journal to express them sometimes replaying arguments in your head is just a way to work out feelings that you haven t been able to express yet in that case it can help just to write everything out that can allow you to identify exactly what s bothering you as well as what you might like to do about it 5 x trustworthy source university of rochester medical center leading academic medical center in the u s focused on clinical care and research go to source you can write in a journal for instance or you might write a letter to the person you re arguing with in your head you don t have to give the person the letter if you don t want to just addressing your thoughts to the person can help you feel a lot better however if you think reading the letter might help them understand you better feel free to give it to them accept that you may sometimes disagree with someone you like as you re working through your thoughts you may realize that you and the other person disagree on something that isn t likely to change like your core values however if you want to keep a friendly relationship with this person sometimes you just have to agree to disagree if that s the case try to let the issue go and avoid bringing up the subject in the future 6 x research source if there are issues you need to address do so in a healthy productive way otherwise sometimes it s best to let smaller things go without worrying about them too much talk to a counselor if rehearsing conversations interferes with your life if you find yourself replaying conversations

services so you may be able to speak with someone without ever having to leave your home you could also talk to someone you trust like a parent a close friend or a school counselor let the other person know you need to talk if you ve been replaying an argument in your head it s often best to talk directly to the other person involved once you ve narrowed down what s really bothering you try to find a time when neither of you are busy or distracted then ask the other person if you can have a moment explain that you ve had something on your mind you d like to talk to them about and ask them if it s okay if you share it for instance if you need to talk to a coworker you might say something like hey carol can i borrow you for a minute before lunch i just want to clear the air after the meeting last week take turns talking even if it feels a little awkward ask the person to let you get all of your thoughts out first then explain that you ll be happy to hear what they have to say

review online and print journal covering topics related to business management practices go to source for example you might say i have a couple of things to say and i m honestly not that great at talking about myself it might be harder for me to explain myself if you interrupt me but if you ll give me a few minutes first i ll definitely welcome your input when i m finished be sure to listen respectfully when it s the other person s turn to talk too speak slowly and with an even tone before you start talking about how you feel take a deep breath and think about what you re about to say

slow deep breaths to compose yourself if you start to feel emotional if you get too upset it can be hard for the other person to focus on what you re really saying they may get caught up in minor details or hone in on the fact that your voice is raised use i statements to express your feelings if the other person feels like you re blaming or attacking them they might shut down or start to feel defensive which can quickly derail a conversation to help avoid that start your sentences with the word i rather than with you 10 x research source for instance instead of saying you were really rude to me yesterday you might say i felt hurt after we talked yesterday don t use i statements as a way to camouflage an attack for instance don t say i feel like you re a big jerk 11 x research source talk about the root of the issue rather than details when you replay an argument in your head it s easy to get bogged down in the little things that made you feel upset however rehashing the things that hurt your feelings isn t likely to be a productive conversation try to stay focused on the big picture like establishing boundaries or avoiding conflict in the future 12 x research source for instance instead of arguing about the other person coming home late explain that you feel worried and disregarded if they don t let you know they re running behind try to stay focused on the issue at hand don t bring up everything from the past that s ever happened even if it s very similar to what you re upset about 13 x research source try to find common ground even if you re disagreeing on a subject you can usually find something to agree on actively listen when the other person is talking and try to find a value you share if you can find a way to relate to the person it can help you feel less stressed during the conversation 14 x trustworthy source american psychological association leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists go to source for instance if you re disagreeing with someone over who s responsible for a project at work you might say something like i know we both have the best interest of the company at heart we just have to find a way to

walk away if you feel like you aren t getting anywhere and you re just becoming more upset politely wrap things up and excuse yourself 15 x trustworthy source american psychological association leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists go to source if you still have unresolved feelings try looking for another way to express them like writing them down or talking to someone else take deep breaths if you start to feel nervous when you re trying to talk to someone about your feelings you may notice yourself feeling anxious the easiest way to help

trustworthy source american psychological association leading scientific and professional organization of licensed psychologists go to source even just taking a few deep breaths can help you regulate your emotions the great thing about this is you can do it anywhere even during a conversation without anyone else noticing try a grounding exercise if your anxiety increases if breathing doesn t help

how to conduct a pilot study,if you have a plan for a larger scientific study it s often a good idea to do a pilot study first with a pilot study you pre test the methodology you plan to use in the full study using a smaller sample the pilot helps you find any problems with your planned methodology so you can correct those before you invest significant time and money on the full study if you choose your sample following the same guidelines as you ve set for the full study your pilot can also give you an idea of what the results might be for your full study a successful pilot study can also help you fulfill your funding needs for your full study by strengthening your grant applications 1 x research source,identify the larger idea or project your pilot study is based on ideally if your pilot study is successful it will lead to a much larger study with a more expansive scope and extensive budget in your pilot study protocol describe how the pilot study will pave the way for that larger study to become a reality 2 x research source ideally you ve already planned the methodology for the full study then you can use the pilot study to assess how doable that methodology actually is list the feasibility questions you plan to answer with your pilot study generally you re using a pilot study to determine if you can actually do the full study assuming you have appropriate funds and resources available look at the planned methodology for the full study and focus on the things you re not sure will work these are the questions you need to ask the objective of your pilot study is to answer those questions 3 x research source for example if your study will take several months to complete you might wonder if you ll be able to retain participants through to the end your feasibility question would be something like can we keep participants in the study through the end provide a concrete measure to determine feasibility once you ve stated the questions your pilot study plans to evaluate describe how you ll answer those questions a quantifiable measure enables you to make an objective determination if your full study is feasible based on the pilot study 4 x research source for example if you re concerned about whether your participants will stick it out through a long term study you might write the full study is feasible if the retention rate for the pilot study is 90 or greater you might have multiple criteria that you re evaluating through the pilot study if so list each of these separately along with a concrete measure for determining the feasibility of the full study calculate your sample size for the pilot study you often don t have to do formal sample size calculations for a pilot study however you do need to have enough participants that your observations will be useful generally include 10 20 of the number of participants planned for your full study 5 x research source the objective of the pilot study isn t necessarily to predict anything about the outcome of the full study so you don t have to worry about your sample size being too small to generalize to the larger population keep in mind the money and resources you have available when you determine the sample size for your pilot study you want to keep the sample size within your means to basically do everything on your own locally since you re unlikely to have access to money for travel or professional services document training of other researchers working on the pilot if you bring in other researchers to work with you on your pilot study create a detailed record of their training sessions including the materials they re provided and the instructions they re given this record enables you to correct any errors in training before the full study 6 x research source for example if you have randomization procedures to control bias in the study your researchers need to understand how to implement those procedures if your instructions are confusing your study could end up being biased plan on keeping the pilot researchers with you for the full study they can help train any additional researchers you bring on board recruit participants that cover the entire range of your full study follow the same recruiting methods you ve outlined for your full study to recruit the same types of people covering the full range enables you to more easily project that the results of the pilot study will be replicated by the full study 7 x research source for example if your full study will include participants in 3 age groups ranging from 18 to 52 your pilot study would ideally include participants from each of the 3 age groups you ve delineated for the full study it might turn out that your recruiting methods work for one of the age groups but aren t as effective for the others similarly you might find that one age group is more likely to stay through the whole study than others evaluate how difficult it is to recruit participants and how long it takes for you to recruit the number of participants you need you can scale this to determine if the recruiting methods you used will work for the full study or if it would take too long for you to get enough participants on board use methods as rigorous as those in the full study using the same methodology as you intend to use for the full study allows you to evaluate whether you can do the full study if on the other hand you take short cuts in the pilot study you won t have any usable information that you can apply to the full study 8 x research source for example if your full study will be double blind your pilot should also have double blind procedures in place while this might make your pilot a little more expensive it s the only way to accurately test the feasibility of the full study if you re trying to figure out if you ll retain participants throughout the course of the full study the pilot study should take just as long as the full study is planned to take 9 x research source interview participants about their experience in the pilot study talking to the participants after the pilot study is over gives you valuable information about your methodology participants can point out issues that you might ve overlooked if you only considered things from a researcher s perspective 10 x research source for example if you had a pilot study to determine if you could retain participants through the end of the study you might give exit interviews with participants who left the study to find out why they left you could then use that information to adjust the full study for greater retention of participants in addition to formal interviews after the study you or other researchers working with you can ask participants questions during the study and encourage them to speak up when they have a problem or if there s something they don t understand instructions or questions that might seem clear to you can be confusing for participants talking to participants about their experience can help you identify areas where your instructions or questions could be clarified modify the full study s methodology based on the pilot study the findings from your pilot study tell you whether the methodology you originally planned for the full study is feasible if the methods didn t work in the pilot study they likely won t work for the full study unless they re changed 11 x research source for example if your question was retention of participants and fewer than half of your participants stayed through the end of the pilot study you would need to modify the full study to make it more likely for participants to stay you could also expand the full study to include more participants with the understanding that at least half of them would drop out information you gained from the pilot study may require you to completely redesign your methodology for the full study if you change the methodology to a significant extent you may need a second pilot study to evaluate the revised methodology incorporate your results into the full study if you didn t find any problems sometimes a pilot study reveals that the methodology for your full study is sound and workable if you don t have to change anything about the protocol for the full study the pilot study simply gives you a jump start on the full study 12 x research source if your pilot study sample didn t cover the entire range anticipated for your full study you ll need to adjust your full study sample to correct for the bias in your pilot study sample otherwise your final results will be skewed,Education-and-Communications

been doing this for a while or this is your first newsletter there are some important steps to take and ensure your newsletter is the best around,define the purpose of your newsletter before you even start writing your newsletter focus in on what your topic and purpose is ask yourself why you want to produce this newsletter you may just want to inform people about a specific topic or you might want to market your business or service the way you write and advertise will be different depending on your purpose so state your reason for making this newsletter as clearly as you can 1 x research source some of the main reasons people or businesses create newsletters include to inform community members gain support for ideas generate sales or traffic to websites rally support for political causes or advertise businesses your approach would be very different depending on what your purpose was write out your purpose to visualize it for example say i want to raise awareness about the tax rate in my state and lobby for change you can also do this if you ve been writing a newsletter for a while and you want to revamp it if you didn t have a clear purpose in mind when you started get back to your roots and define your goals find a topic that you re qualified to write about readers of a newsletter generally expect quality writing and information so you should pick a topic that you re comfortable with choose something you ve read a lot about are passionate about or have a background in this will make your writing and information much better and your readers will notice 2 x research source if you re not an expert in something you can still write a newsletter about it you ll just have to spend some time learning about it for example you may want to write a newsletter about politics in your state but don t have much experience that s fine you just have to spend some time reading the news and learning the main issues at hand you could also include content from other writers and reporters who know more about specific topics if you re producing a newsletter for someone else then you might not be especially passionate about the topic however if you re creative you can still insert some topics you know a lot about within that newsletter identify the audience for your newsletter audience is very important for a successful newsletter if you were writing for teenagers you d present the information much differently than if you were writing for ceos use the topic and purpose of your newsletter to determine who your main readership will be then you can zero in on your main audience and write content geared towards them 3 x research source sometimes it s very easy to identify your audience for example if you re doing a newsletter for your school then the audience is probably your fellow students in some cases it s a little harder to identify your audience if you re writing a political newsletter for instance there are potentially millions of people that you could appeal to spend a lot of time thinking about your message and who you want to read your newsletter if you ve been producing your newsletter for a while but haven t been able to expand then you may have misidentified your audience do some research and find out who exactly is reading your newsletter then try to reorient your content to that audience set a budget for your newsletter while it s much cheaper to publish newsletters with computers than in the old days of printing it could still get expensive you might want to hire other writers and designers get new equipment pay for software and all types of other expenses it could get pricey fast research the equipment and services you ll need to run your newsletter and add up the potential costs set a limit for yourself from the start to avoid spending too much 4 x research source if you have a decent computer you could produce a great newsletter very cheaply it ll just take some time to learn new skills like design email marketing and subscription services could get expensive and might be where you spend the most money for a newsletter with a large readership you could spend a few hundred dollars per month on email distribution investigate different services to find the best rates schedule 1 or 2 issues per month while there s no set schedule for a newsletter 1 2 issues per month is a good target this is consistent enough that your readers will get regular content but not so often that you ll overwhelm yourself with work set this target schedule for the best results 5 x research source some newsletters come out weekly but a weekly newsletter will be very time consuming it may not be possible without helpers or a full time commitment you can always change the schedule if you want to publish more or less often when you get started the most important thing is that you can handle the publishing schedule don t overwhelm yourself and make sure you always have quality content to produce recruit other team members if you need them while you could produce a newsletter alone you might need some help other writers designers reporters and marketers might be a big help in improving and distributing your newsletter recruit these team members before getting started 6 x research source if you want professional helpers you can check freelance websites for experienced writers and marketers remember that other people will probably be paid for their work unless you can recruit volunteers include these expenses in your budget you could also start out alone to get the newsletter off the ground and recruit helpers later when you get more readers target your writing to your intended audience writing to your audience is one of the most important parts of running a newsletter always have the audience at the front of your mind and write stories and content that you know they want to see this way your content will be relevant and you ll gain more readers 7 x research source the content you choose to cover depends on your audience as well if your newsletter is about politics in your state then it s probably not relevant to write about a new pizza parlor opening your readers want political information your writing style should also change based on your audience if you re writing to students or teens then don t use too many big words or jargon if you re writing to engineers then you can probably include some technical terms that you know they ll understand if you aren t sure how to approach your audience then do some research and read other newsletters targeted to a similar audience see how these newsletters present information and craft their stories and try to follow that write short readable stories that people can skim quickly newsletters aren t books or feature length articles they should contain little snippets that people can scan easily keep your written content simple and understandable no matter who your audience is 8 x trustworthy source purdue online writing lab trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines go to source short catchy sentences and bullet points are very good for a newsletter they sum up the main points quickly there is no set length for a newsletter but in general they shouldn t take very long to read your average person might skim it while they re having their breakfast or on the bus so make it something that someone can read in a few minutes if you have a website as well you can include links to larger stories in your newsletter that way you can keep your newsletter short and still write longer content focus on 2 or 3 short stories in each issue while there is no set length for a newsletter it should be short enough for people to scan in general 2 or 3 articles per issue is a good target this provides enough content for people to read but not so much that they ll be overwhelmed 9 x trustworthy source purdue online writing lab trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines go to source many newsletters show 1 or 2 articles then contain links to other content this is a good idea to keep each issue short but still drive readership to their websites set a format that s easy to follow don t go too overboard with your format remember most people are scanning the newsletter quickly and might be reading it on their phones pick a simple format that flows well a simple 2 column layout with some designs around the margins is a popular newsletter style but pick the one that you think works best for you 10 x research source look online for newsletter templates these might not be very unique but they ll be clear and readable some newsletters have a lot of pictures and just a few bullet points or simple sentences next to them this could work well for a younger audience test out your format before running the newsletter ask friends and family if they can follow and understand the content choose eye catching graphics to hook readers in while a newsletter is more about the written content than images a few well placed images are a big help they can draw readers in and make your newsletter look more professional sprinkle in a few graphics designs and pictures to give your newsletter a unique identity 11 x trustworthy source purdue online writing lab trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines go to source if your newsletter is about local news then

how to use the singular they,language evolves although you might have been told in school that you should never use they to refer to a single person as of 2020 most major style guides including associated press mla apa and chicago embrace using they as a singular pronoun generally singular they takes the place of generic or indefinite nouns if the gender of the person is unknown or irrelevant additionally singular they is used by many individuals who are nonbinary or otherwise gender nonconforming 1 x research source,swap singular they for generic nouns if gender is unknown pronouns are often used in place of a generic noun such as a job title nurse firefighter veterinarian or nationality american swede japanese singular they is appropriate if the gender of the person you re describing is either unknown or irrelevant 2 x research source for example suppose you re writing about a firefighter who rescued a family s cat from their burning home if you don t know the gender of the firefighter you could just say firefighter over and over but that would become monotonous instead use the singular they the firefighter leaped over the flames as they carried the cat out of the house the singular they is also appropriate if the gender of the person discussed is irrelevant for example if you re a hiring manager writing a job listing for nurses the gender of the nurse you hire is irrelevant so you would use the singular they when describing the job duties the nurse is responsible for maintaining the charts of all patients they review the doctor s notes and update accordingly refer back to indefinite pronouns with the singular they in some writing you might use indefinite pronouns such as anyone or someone rather than repeating that same indefinite pronoun use the singular they to add more information about the indefinite person discussed 3 x research source for example you might write if anyone has their notes from last class i d like a copy substitute they for he or she to better match the people described previously style guides recommended writing he or she rather than choosing a single gendered pronoun to refer to all people using the singular they takes this a step further and recognizes that not all people use binary gendered pronouns 4 x research source for example you might write each student takes their grades seriously this sentence is more inclusive than writing each student takes his or her grades seriously because there may be students who don t use those pronouns use the plural verb form with singular they even though you re using they to represent a single person you still use the plural verb form with the pronoun this can be confusing if you re thinking of they as singular but because you re used to they being plural it sounds better with the plural verb than the singular verb 5 x research source for example you would write each student takes their grades seriously they are going to succeed notice that they are sounds natural whereas they is would sound wrong reword the sentence if singular they sounds awkward sometimes the singular they adds confusion or makes it difficult for your readers to figure out what noun the pronoun relates back to step away from your writing for a little while then go back and read through it again if your usage of the singular they seems confusing figure out how to edit the sentence so your meaning is clear 6 x research source for example suppose you write after reading an article about loneliness among troops stationed overseas i sent them a care package even though you ve used the singular they the context of the sentence makes it seem as though you sent care packages to multiple people instead you could write after reading an article about loneliness among troops stationed overseas i sent a care package to a soldier ask a specific person what their pronouns are if you re writing about a specific person and you don t know their pronouns ask them before you start writing don t just assume once you know their pronouns use them where appropriate 7 x research source if a person says they use he or she don t swap those out for the singular they stick with the pronoun they use if you don t have access to the person look for other articles written about them and see what pronouns were used leave out the pronoun entirely if you aren t sure if you re writing about someone and don t know their pronouns it s most respectful to simply recast your sentences about that person so that you aren t using any pronouns at all that way you don t have to worry about inadvertently using the wrong pronoun 8 x research source think about other ways to refer to the person that are gender neutral you might refer to where they live their job title or other personal traits for example you might write j r smith teaches at city university where the texan also advocates for human rights make sure the other words you use are relevant to what you re writing and the context within which you re writing for example if you re writing for your school newspaper referring to a person using your school s mascot might be appropriate a freshman at ucla the bruin hopes to one day become a documentary filmmaker however in the same context it would be awkward to refer to the person by their hair color a freshman at ucla the brunette hopes to one day become a documentary filmmaker switch to the plural verb form when using the pronoun even though they refers to a single particular person this pronoun also requires plural verbs not singular verbs revise your writing as necessary if it seems awkward or confusing but always use the plural verb with the pronoun and the singular verb with the person s name 9 x research source for example you might write dakota is the first nonbinary professor at this law school they teach contracts and corporate law,Education-and-Communications
how to write a summary of a research paper,writing a summary of an academic research paper is an important skill and it shows that you understand all of the relevant information presented to you however writing a summary can be tough since it requires you to be completely objective and keep any analysis or criticisms to yourself by keeping your goal in mind as you read the paper and focusing on the key points you can write a succinct accurate summary of a research paper to prove that you understood the overall conclusion,figure out the focus of your summary before you start reading the research paper think about what you re going to be using the summary for you may need to focus on different information for different projects or subjects 1 x research source for instance if you re supporting an argument in your own research paper focus on the elements that are similar to yours or if you re comparing and contrasting methodology focus on the methods and the significance of the results scan through the article to pick out important information flip through the paper briefly and notice the section headings relevant information and conclusions pick out the sections that you deem to be important so you can focus more on those 2 x research source you can also read the abstract of the paper as a good example of what the authors find to be important in their article read the article fully 1 to 2 times sit down and focus on reading the research paper from cover to cover at least once if not twice if there s any information you don t understand read through it again until you can piece out what s being said if you don t understand the paper you won t be able to write an accurate summary of it 3 x research source depending on how long and dense the paper is your initial reading could take you up to an hour or more underline or highlight important information that way you can come back to it later as you write your summary so you know what to include you can decide what s important based on what you re using your summary for and what the focus of the paper is 4 x research source the important information will usually be toward the end of the paper as the authors explain their findings and conclusions take notes summarizing sections in your own words as you read jot down some notes explaining the takeaways of each section make sure you re writing in your own words to prepare you for writing an entire summary try to write down the important ideas to come back to later 5 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source writing a summary without plagiarizing or copying the paper is really important writing notes in your own words will help you get into the mindset of relaying information in your own way aim to report the findings not evaluate them it can be easy to turn a summary into an analysis of the paper especially if you re used to writing your own research papers however for summary writing you should try to simply report on the findings not add in your own evaluation or critique of the paper or methods 6 x research source for example the methods used in this paper are not up to standards and require more testing to be conclusive is an analysis the methods used in

publications before you complete your phd makes you more competitive for the limited number of lecturer positions available 6 x research source having publications before you finish graduate school can be difficult but it does show potential employers that you are serious about your academic research it also shows them that you are likely to keep up with the demands of the tenure deadline do university service during your graduate program in addition to teaching and scholarship you should work on getting experience with university service while in graduate school this will show that you will be an attribute to a university department and you understand that service to the institution is a key component of the job of a lecturer service to the university can come in a wide variety of forms a few examples include serving as the graduate student representative on hiring committees and helping organize conferences or speaking engagements at your university consider taking a post doc position in order to consolidate your teaching experience conference experience and to add to your publications many phd s take on temporary contracts as a post doctoral researchers or teachers many use this time to convert their phd dissertation into a book or publications also if you did not get teaching experience during your graduate program you may need to consider a post doc position to get that experience 7 x research source once you have publications and teaching experience it is much more likely that you will be able to get a job as a university lecturer look for job postings as with most jobs these days academic lecturer positions are posted online on university or college websites and the websites of higher education organizations search specific university websites as well as the websites of organizations focusing on higher education jobs in the uk 8 x research source there are also specialty websites that post jobs in specific academic disciplines it may be that you will hear about jobs from colleagues and supervisors as well for instance if you are in a phd program you may hear about an upcoming job from a professor in your department or from other students in your program you should be willing to go to a variety of locations if you want to be a university lecturer limiting your job search by location is not a good idea with the limited job openings there are going where the jobs are is important create a cv a cv which is short for curriculum vitae is basically an academic resume it lists all of your experiences in academia and the skills you have developed there it should be done in a clear and concise format that highlights your experience and unique attributes 9 x research source one of the benefits of using a cv is that is doesn t need to be changed for each position you are applying for since it is a thorough list of all of your work and education at minimum your cv should include sections for education teaching experience publications and university service as well as references do research about the school you should find out as much as you can about the school you are hoping to teach at this includes their overall philosophy their financial situation and their plans for the future this information is usually available online look for general university or college information information about the specific department you are hoping to join and about the faculty already in that department complete and turn in an application an academic job application will usually include a cover letter statement of teaching philosophy one of your publications and other documents in addition to your cv when completing a job application for a lecturer position you need to make sure to do some research about the university and its courses before you apply you also need to read the job ad very carefully so you know exactly what they want with the information you get in your research you can tailor your application to the needs of the institution most job applications are done online these days there is usually a link connected to the job posting where you will turn in all of your application components when turning in electronic documents for a job application make sure the documents are in a format that will not allow them to be changed depending on what application is used to view them 10 x research source for instance a pdf document is in a permanent form that will not be altered by the pdf viewer that is used to view it prepare for interviews for most lecturer positions you will need to go through several rounds of interviews before you are chosen these may include an initial phone or video interview and then an in person interview if you are a finalist for the job some things you should do while preparing for your interviews include 11 x research source review what is unique about you while doing an interview it is important to highlight what it unique and important about you if you can get these points across the people interviewing you are likely to understand how you could improve the program you are hoping to join practice likely questions while you won t be able to know exactly what your interviewers will ask there are some common questions you can practice these include questions about your research your teaching experience and your experience with academic service negotiate your contract once you have been chosen for a lecturer position you will need to negotiate your contract this is the first time in the process that you have some power to control the situation but you shouldn t get too greedy once the college or university gives you an initial offer you can choose to negotiate about any part of their offer asking for more salary startup money resources or other forms of support do some research about salaries at the university or college you are hoping to work at and keep your requests in keeping with existing salaries in many cases if it is a public institution this information is public and can be found online 12 x research source when you go into negotiations you need to remember that the university or college is likely going to begin with a low offer with the expectation that you will try to negotiate for more however with the sheer number of qualified people applying for every lecturer position remember that you can t ask for too much or they might move on to someone else advance in your career once you have a lecturer position you will need to work hard to keep that position and advance in your university most lecturer positions are permanent however beginning lecturers are in a probationary position until they pass an evaluation after three years there is room for advancement from lecturer to senior lecturer to full professor for lecturers but this career advancement requires excellence in teaching service and research 13 x research source not all lecturers will advance all the way to full professors during their careers the position of full professor is reserved for those that have shown particularly excellent work in their scholarship teaching and service advancements are usually attained when an existing position opens when department heads nominate a lecturer for advancement or when a lecturer applies for advancement,Education-and-Communications

academia seem less like a job talk to an academic if you think you want to be an academic consider meeting someone who is already one in the your desired field or discipline they can tell you about the realities of academia answer questions you have give you tips for getting started and guide your goals for the future in the u s college and university professors have regular office hours each week as part of their employment members of the public can schedule a half hour to an hour appointment to ask questions about entering the profession if a senior professor is too busy to have time usually a younger professor will be suggested who is up to date on the most recent trends concerning entering the field and transitioning from graduate school to employment inquire how they got into their academic career ask about their education and or any professional or practical experience they had think about your personality an academic career can be very demanding you ll need to constantly be learning about new concepts and sharing that knowledge in a variety of modes such as journal articles books and the classes you teach you ll also need to compete for positions in addition working with a university faculty can require navigating delicate personal and political situations you will need to set aside your own emotions and biases to provide equal treatment of all you might want to ask yourself some of the following questions how deep is my commitment to this field am i willing to potentially move often and continuously pursue jobs am i willing to start part time as an adjunct faculty member am i able to work in an unstructured environment and self start projects can i create and pursue my own research topics am i willing to participate on a campus committee that has meetings do i want to be a mentor to students can i handle the competitive nature of this career consider your career and salary goals academics often choose their career because it s their passion however the jobs you get may depend on what s available at the time additionally salary can vary wildly as high paying positions are limited people with the same credentials can make vastly different salaries ask yourself if you d like to teach and work with students consider if you re only interested in working with other academics such as in a think tank 4 x research source look up salary amounts in your area consider if you can adapt your lifestyle if necessary for example a full professor will make considerably more than an adjunct professor or lecturer 5 x research source the amount can also differ according to your experience and job location 6 x research source think about the other skills you can use to add to your income and if you d be willing to take on other work for example community college college and university faculty in the u s sometimes make a significant portion of their income through authoring or co authoring textbooks used in their fields 7 x research source finish your bachelor s degree you have to finish your bachelor s degree to pursue a phd which is generally the education requirement for a career in academia 8 x research source take classes in the discipline that you d like to be an academic to give yourself an advantage of getting into graduate programs and make attaining your phd somewhat easier save all of your undergraduate and graduate essays since you may need them when you apply to graduate programs to show as an example of your work additionally they may inspire your future research consider majoring in your preferred academic discipline or one closely related to it for example if you want to be an animal behaviorist you could major in ethology or comparative psychology 9 x research source if you want to be a historian you could consider anthropology or philosophy take courses that complement your preferred field of specialization for example if want to be an archaeologist consider classes in history and anthropology substitute teach to gain experience if you aren t sure about academia with a bachelor s degree in the u s you can substitute teach almost anywhere as long as you have a clean background check this will allow you to try out the teaching profession for a year with pay to see if you like being in front of the classroom this also allows you to apply for a graduate teaching assistantship with teaching experience if you already know you want to be an academic you may want to immediately enter an advanced degree program however substituting still provides valuable experience to help further your prospects obtain an advanced degree after your bachelor s degree the next step will be your master s degree depending on the field you may choose a master of arts master of science or master of fine arts most academic positions require a doctor of philosophy phd once you ve finished your bachelor s degree or master s degree 10 x research source having the right degrees ensures to you and potential employers that you have mastered the required information to pursue a career in academia for example in the u s a newly hired assistant professor is frequently assigned to teach courses in the dissertation field since the new phd has been vetted already in that topic by a faculty committee in his or her graduate school program pursue your phd since most academics teach and do research at universities or colleges you will need a graduate degree most institutions require a phd though some institutions and disciplines may only require an ma or ms or even professional experience 11 x research source some programs allow you to earn both your ma and phd at the same time though you ll need to complete the coursework for your ma before pursuing the phd coursework learn about different programs in your specific discipline different universities have different disciplines and fields in which they specialize 12 x research source for example if you want to be an animal behaviorist you might want to find specific programs in this field or related fields likewise if you want to be a historian of europe you d want to figure out the best programs for that instead of for american history 13 x research source make sure your degree granting institution is accredited which assures that the quality of your education meets acceptable levels the us department of educations provides a list of accredited universities 14 x research source conduct research most academics conduct original research and then publish it you ll prepare a dissertation as part of your graduate program once you start working as an academic you ll write articles books and other media research or creative production is often the bread and butter of any academic 15 x research source be aware that the point of scholarship is to expand current knowledge of your particular field make sure your research is original and that no one has used your specific topic and or method of analysis before you begin this will require that you master the scholarly literature related to your field choose an area that hasn t been explored in depth 16 x research source make sure to get any permissions or clearances you need to do your research especially if it requires using human or animal subjects take copious and detailed notes as this will help you write up and publish your research you should maintain digital files with notes that include your citations then when you are faced with seminar papers theses and dissertation writing you can cull through these digital files rather than having to start from scratch publish your findings when they re ready one of the primary components of being an academic is publishing your research findings 17 x research source in fact sometimes one will hear the phrase publish or perish start by submitting to journals and conferences aim to publish your research at a rate commensurate to your field your thesis is a good starting topic for your dissertation and your dissertation is a good starting presentation for your first book wait to publish your thesis or dissertation until after it s been accepted a master s thesis and a phd dissertation are commonly only acceptable in the u s if the material has not already been published even by the same author begin publishing your research as soon as it is ready including if you are still in graduate school unless your department or your graduate school only accepts unpublished materials for the thesis dissertation ask colleagues and friends about what general expectations for publication within your field are if you work at a university there may be guidelines on publication expectations aim to publish with the most prestigious academic presses or peer reviewed journals in your field as possible this can help you gain exposure and may help complete your portfolio for tenure note that print and online journals have author guidelines that you need to check concerning how the specific journal requires submissions to be made teach courses in your field many academics who work at universities conduct research and teach students getting teaching experience in your specific and possibly related fields can not only make you attractive to potential employers but also help you master your field and round out your curriculum vitae 18 x research source cultural centers retirement communities cruise lines recreational centers and other unexpected places will frequently host academic speakers who are still building a tenure portfolio some pay some accept volunteers only keep a copy of each publicity material issued since you will want to include those in a section on public presentations in your tenure portfolio see if your university requires being a teaching assistant ta as a part of your graduate studies if your campus has a shortage of teaching assistants consider volunteering to be a ta in a different field than yours to show your ability to be flexible as an academic for example if you work on american history offer to ta a course on african history this may help you make connections with your own work as well ask if you can teach independent or online courses in your field volunteer to teach courses that may be less popular the more diversified your teaching experience is the more attractive you may be to potential employers junior faculty are frequently hired to teach the courses senior faculty do not wish to teach then over the years the junior faculty gain the opportunities to list their favorite topics in the curriculum this develops as colleagues become acquainted and gain trust obtain practical experience depending on your chosen discipline consider getting an internship or job that will enhance your coursework with practical experience ask if your university or college can help you find internships or jobs that complement your studies be aware that many graduate programs and employers particularly in health fields or the sciences may require internships or practical experience to graduate or start a job 19 x research source graduate students in the arts most often have the privilege of reserving campus performance space for free if your campus has an intellectual property attorney get a copy of a release for performers to sign that allows you to digitize excepts of the performance for your tenure portfolio and make certain you save copies of the program publicity materials to document your efforts if the campus newspaper or community newspaper publishes review you should retain a copy of that also to document your success consider doing an internship complementary to your field for example it may be difficult to find an internship as a historian or archaeologist but you could intern in a library or archives which would give you experience in conducting research explore what is available to you in ethnography also get different types of experience to give you sense of what work you could do and what kind of work suits you best for example you may want to work for your university astronomy lab during the school year and pursue an internship at a local planetarium in the summer many internships and residencies like universities are also accredited the us department of education also offers a list of these programs 20 x research source apply for funding whether you are a student or have finished your graduate education apply for grants and fellowships from your university and outside institutions winning grants and fellowships can not only help pay for your research but also attract other organizations to fund you look for grant and fellowship opportunities at different universities and colleges research institutions government agencies or independent groups see chronicle of philanthropy and its annual register of grants offered for example if you are a physicist see what funding opportunities your university the national science foundation and the european physical society offer 21 x research source you want to compete for the most prestigious grants as well as smaller ones be aware that some institutions will require that you be a member in order to apply for funding stay on top of current research inform yourself about current research performance in your discipline and specific field as well as any related fields you can do this by attending conferences and seminars reading journals and networking with colleagues this knowledge may help you more effectively do your job and can also make you attractive to potential employers 22 x research source read journals from your specifics areas of expertise and those related to it for example if you work on the history of cultural heritage you might want to read publications by historians anthropologists ethnographers and archaeologists legal journals may also be of use subscribe to journals related to your specific fields read online journals and familiarize yourself with library collections of periodicals in your field this can help you stay most current on research through articles and reviews you may also find job listings in these journals go to conferences for your specific discipline and field for example if you are a quantum physicist you could attend the american physical society s annual conference as well as that of international quantum structure association 23 x research source some of these professional associations also offer academic placement services for example college composition and communications assists graduate students in obtaining placement in non fiction writing and in speech making be aware that staying on top of current research can also help your teaching profile as an academic you will be expected to have things to say and keeping up with research and performance in your discipline gives you things to talk about person to person with colleagues and in the classroom when you are fielding student questions start your job search early ideally you will learn about shortage areas in your field by reading job postings being aware of shortages allows you to add a few graduate courses in those shortage areas so that you can provide coverage for those topics when you are hired into a faculty if you wait until you finish your phd to find a job your skills might not match the demand and you may have trouble securing even a term position as an adjunct 24 x research source reference the job posting when you apply always tie something in your background to the specific requirements listed in the job posting make your application relevant to the needs of the institution to which you are applying start researching universities agencies institutions and organizations with which you may be interested in working when you enter graduate school discuss with your graduate faculty what research problems your field is trying to solve and figure out whether any of those research problems interests you for your thesis dissertation cross check that with job offerings ask your doctoral advisor professors colleagues friends and especially the student placement office for advice on where when and how to apply for academic jobs 25 x research source submit job applications most academics work at places like universities and research institutions because competition for academic positions in many fields is strong apply to as many positions as you can in your field or related fields if you have met with any faculty from the posting department mention that you are applying because of the good impression the department made at the specific conference how and why prepare yourself for rejection competition for academic jobs can be very high and it s very likely you ll have several rejections remember that the decision is not personal but that you re likely in a pool of other very qualified candidates search the websites or publications of professional academic associations every day new jobs may appear daily academic positions are generally posted 6 to 9 months before the position is to begin check online listserves specific to your discipline or field talk to your advisor professors or colleagues if they re aware of any job openings they will generally refer you to published sources that you then need to examine frequently once a listing produces hundreds of responses the posting will generally be taken down so if you are not watching for postings you probably will miss some submit material requested by the position ad this often includes a cover letter cv writing samples and proof of ability to obtain funding if the department position is not funded by the school consider professional positions you may prefer a professional position with a business rather than a job at a university or may not have had any luck on the academic market there are a multitude of options for academics at places like think tanks government agencies or museums 26 x research source remember that you can also try substitute teaching while you seek other positions look for professional positions in academic publications newspapers professional recruiting sites or by asking headhunters submit letters of interest and ask about career opportunities at places that interest you see if you can set up an informational interview network with other academics meeting and talking with academic colleagues or professionals from your field or related disciplines can expand your ability to find a job as well as increase your knowledge go to conferences establish a local seminar and join professional organizations to network with fellow academics join organizations in your specific discipline and field for example if you are a historian of modern germany you might want to join the american historical association and the german studies association go to conferences make sure to attend panels related to your work and any social events offered these can help you meet new people who share your interests academics want to be known in their fields being an academic is a social role in addition to a continuing study function set up regular meetings or seminar meetings for colleagues in your field and discipline or related disciplines in your local area keep the publicity materials for inclusion in your tenure portfolio these portfolios can be inches thick or feet thick depending on the academic discipline circulate feedback forms and retain the most positive ones for inclusion in your tenure portfolio,Education-and-Communications

become a university lecturer choose a field to go into that you d be comfortable working in for much of your career 1 x research source you will probably find more success in the long run by choosing a field you enjoy rather than one that you think will earn you the most money for example if you re passionate about literature it may be more worthwhile to go into that field instead of something you don t enjoy earn a phd to maximize your chances of becoming a lecturer although there are exceptions most universities require their lecturers to have earned a doctoral degree in their field of study having a phd demonstrates your expertise in a subject matter and may also give you experience in both researching and teaching 2 x research source at smaller colleges and technical schools you may be more likely to be hired as a lecturer with only a master s degree at any rate you ll almost certainly need to acquire education beyond the college level when going into a phd program be prepared to be in it for the long haul although some phd programs can be completed in 3 years many others take up to 7 years conduct independent research and have it published demonstrating a research profile both through publishing research and articulating compelling plans for future work is often key to getting a job as a lecturer research extensively during your phd program and publish your findings in a reputable academic journal 3 x research source aim to publish your findings in the most reputable journal in your field for example history phds should publish their work in the journal of american history which has one of the widest readerships among history journals if you go into a postdoc before becoming a lecturer after finishing graduate school consider publishing your dissertation as a book take advantage of opportunities to acquire teaching experience because teaching is such a central aspect of the job of a university lecturers teaching skills are highly valued among job applicants seize opportunities to gain teaching experience when they emerge and use the experience to add to your resume 4 x research source for example if your university has a night school see if you can teach a course in your field while you re still working on your phd although it s less valuable than college teaching experience teaching at the high school level may also be useful for garnering teaching experience look for openings on academic job listing websites universities typically post openings for lecturer positions on listservs and websites that specialize in academic jobs browse these sites on a regular basis and be on the lookout for jobs you might be able to apply for 5 x research source some of the more popular sites used by academics and universities include h net

skills or experience that wouldn t obviously be useful in the job you re applying for tailor your cover letter to the position you re applying for your cover letter is one of the most important parts of your job application it allows you to expand on why you re the best person for the job thus make sure the content of your cover letter is designed around the specific job you re applying for and does not come across as generic for example if the job listing you re responding to described specific classes that the university wants you to teach describe any prior experience you have in that specific subject matter and or how you would go about organizing your class include your teaching philosophy in your personal statement some universities may have you write a personal statement in addition to your cover letter take this opportunity to expound on your teaching philosophy experience and skills and showcase what makes you a better potential university lecturer than other applicants 7 x research source for example you may discuss cutting edge pedagogical techniques you employ or would like to employ in your classes note that you should not do this if the job listing specifies a particular topic you should address in your personal statement ask your professors to serve as references you ll need at least 2 references and oftentimes 3 when submitting an application for a job as a university lecturer your references should be professors or lecturers themselves who know your research and teaching experience and can describe your qualifications in detail 8 x research source if you had a primary advisor during your phd program this person will probably be one of the best people to ask to be a reference for you ask any professors in your department who are widely known and respected in their field to serve as a reference their reputation will add a lot of weight to their description of you prepare for likely questions in your interview the interview for academic jobs is mainly to gauge whether or not you know the material you re being asked to teach thus the questions you re likely to be asked are relatively easy to predict 9 x research source for example you can look at what other members of the department research and how their work might intersect with your own to gauge what areas of your research they will most likely ask you about look closely at the job description and note any skills or experience that it highlights you can expect to be asked about how your own skills and experience line up with those sought after in the ideal job

how to become a law professor,maybe you had a particularly inspirational professor in law school who motivated you to follow in their footsteps or after a few years of practice you miss law school and decide you d rather go back and teach whatever your motivation becoming a law professor can be challenging especially with so few new professors being hired each year however if you have a strong academic background and expertise in a specific field of law there are several different paths you can take to try to become a law professor 1 x research source,go to one of the top law schools in the country most law professors got their law degree at harvard yale stanford or chicago there are another dozen or so prominent law schools that regularly produce law professors as well if you re planning on taking the classical path toward becoming a law professor you need to get your law degree from one of these schools 2 x research source some high ranking schools have greater prominence regionally for example if you wanted to teach at a southern law school you could likely make the cut with a degree from emory duke or vanderbilt if you were planning on teaching on the west coast you could add berkeley and ucla to the list perform exceptionally well academically while in law school how well you do is determined relatively according to your class rank while you don t necessarily have to graduate first in your class aim to be in the top 5 the lower ranked your law school the higher your class rank needs to be if you want to get noticed 3 x research source regardless of which school you go to there is little hope for you to become a law professor if you aren t in the top 25 of your class 4 x research source join the law review and hold a senior editorial position if you re taking the classical path toward becoming a law professor you need to be a member of the most important law review at your law school while most law schools have several journals that focus on a particular field of law for the classical path the main law review is the only one that matters 5 x research source you also need to hold a senior editorial position in your third year ideally you ll be editor in chief if you don t manage to take the top spot you should at least be in charge of a particular department or process for example you might be the articles editor publish at least one article in law school if you re on law review staff you ll write a student note and submit it for publication not all student notes are published however if you want to become a law professor your note should be good enough to be published 6 x research source in addition to your student note start working on an article that you can submit to other journals for publication after you graduate from law school ideally your other article will be in the same area of law as your student note so you can start building expertise in an area you might also consider writing an article about a core area of law that you studied your first year of law school such as contracts or criminal law new law professors often teach first year classes so it s a good idea to establish expertise in one of those areas serve as a clerk for a judge after law school the top law professor candidates usually spend the first few years after graduating clerking for prestigious judges the us court of appeals is a good place to start a clerkship with a justice on the supreme court is best 7 x research source new graduates typically clerk for a judge on the appellate court first then apply for a clerkship with a supreme court justice state court clerkships even at the appellate level are not as impressive as federal court clerkships continue to publish after law school a clerkship typically also gives you the opportunity to research and write you ll see challenging cases come through the courts every day and will have a sense of developing trends in the law you ll also have insight on hot button issues that could make for compelling journal articles 8 x research source look for an issue on which federal circuits are divided a case that presents that issue is ripe for a supreme court decision and could serve as the basis for a strong journal article that could be cited by appellate court judges or even supreme court justices practice at a top law firm for 2 to 5 years after your clerkships gain some experience practicing law preferably at a nationally renowned white shoe law firm most of these firms are located in new york city although they typically have branch offices all over the world 9 x research source while you do want some experience practicing law too much experience could sink your chances of becoming a law professor law schools favor academic scholarship over practice in the legal trade particularly for tenure track positions the career services company vault publishes law firm rankings every year based on the assessments of practicing lawyers if you re taking the classical route toward becoming a law professor aim to be an associate at one of the top 10 law firms on this list 10 x research source get recommendations from professors for a law professor application you ll need at least 3 or 4 references they should be from professors who understand your research and scholarship interests not necessarily professors whose classes you took in law school 11 x research source the professors can be from any school however you typically want at least 2 professors to be from the school where you graduated it helps if you have a famous professor or two but don t go for prestige over substance earn strong grades in law school if you follow the post doc path you ll be getting another degree after your law degree so your grades and class rank in law school aren t as important as they would be if you took the classical path however you still need strong grades to be accepted into a post doc program law schools will also look at your grades in law school when you apply to be a professor even if you have another degree 12 x research source generally you should be in the top 25 30 of your class if you re getting another degree after law school serve on the editorial board of a law journal when you re getting another degree after your law degree you may not necessarily need to be the editor in chief of your school s most prestigious law review however some journal experience is still important to demonstrate your interest in legal scholarship 13 x research source serving on the editorial board is typically less important than publishing articles however being on the staff of a journal gives you the best opportunity to write a journal article write at least one legal research article while in law school if you re on the staff of a law journal your article might be your student note however it s a good idea to get started on another article with the aim of submitting it to law journals after you graduate 14 x research source if all you have is your student note you should at least have a thesis for an additional research project lined up along with some preliminary research apply to graduate law programs at top law schools if you get another degree after law school you might have a better chance of getting a job as a law professor if your other degree is also in law advanced law studies include llm jsd or sjd programs however these degrees won t help you much in your quest to become a law student unless they re from one of the best law schools in the country such as harvard or yale 15 x research source yale also has a ph d in law offered by yale law school graduate law programs also give you additional opportunities to engage in legal scholarship so you could potentially get another publication or two under your belt by the time you graduate teach legal research and writing at a top law school legal research and writing lrw instructors typically aren t tenure track professors who are only hired to teach for a semester or year at a time lrw instructors primarily teach first year legal writing classes but may have other duties such as overseeing brief writing for the school s moot court teams 16 x research source because these are non tenure track positions they are typically easier to get and allow you to get your feet wet and decide if teaching law is what you really want to do as an lrw instructor you have full use of the school s library and access to the other faculty this can give you the tools you need to write and publish articles get a fellowship to increase your research and writing many top law schools including harvard and yale offer fellowship programs that give students who want to become law professors the opportunity to pursue legal scholarship typically you need a specific proposal for the type of research you plan to do fellows may also assist in teaching classes at the law school or mentor jd students 17 x research source fellowships are highly competitive you might also try getting a job at a law school as a visiting assistant professor vap these jobs also allow you to continue your research and writing although your work will be far more self directed than it would in a fellowship 18 x research source get exceptional grades in law school regardless of your approach to becoming a law professor a strong academic record is important at a minimum you should rank in the top 25 30 of your class the highest possible rank is always the best 19 x research source your class rank and grades will be more important to the law schools when you apply as a law professor than they will be when you apply for your graduate degree faculty and admissions staff in other disciplines will likely be unfamiliar with the law school grading process work on a law journal to show your interest in legal scholarship particularly if you re getting a degree in another discipline law schools might question if you re more committed to that discipline than you are to law law schools tend to hire professors who are passionate about legal study and scholarship your work on a law journal in law school helps you establish and demonstrate that interest 20 x research source you might consider a position at a journal related to your other degree if your law school has such a journal for example if you re planning to get a ph d in economics you might serve on the editorial board of a law and economics journal practice law for 2 to 5 years before going back to school generally it s a good idea to get some legal practice in before you get your graduate degree in a related discipline as opposed to going straight to school it will be easier to find a job at a law firm while you re in law school and can take advantage of your school s career resources 21 x research source when potential employers ask you about your career goals you shouldn t lie however it s probably best to downplay the fact that you re planning on going back to school to get a degree in another discipline in a couple of years pursue a graduate degree in an academic area related to law to take an interdisciplinary approach toward becoming a law professor you need a ph d in a discipline that frequently intersects legal study the specific degree might also dictate the types of law school courses you would be qualified to teach 22 x research source for example many jurisprudence or legal philosophy professors also have a ph d in philosophy economics is another discipline that frequently intersects with legal study continue to publish in law journals while getting your graduate degree the danger in getting a degree in another discipline is that you will appear to have abandoned the law for several years although your focus will be on your degree programs balance your study out with a couple of publications in law journals 23 x research source look for interdisciplinary journals where you can write articles about areas where the two disciplines intersect or overlap this will reinforce the idea that you re getting the other degree to supplement and enrich your law degree and contribute to your legal scholarship keep in touch with your old law school professors as you work towards your graduate degree continually reach out to old law school professors and maintain relationships with them when you enter the legal teaching market you ll need recommendations from professors keeping these relationships active also demonstrates your commitment to legal scholarship 24 x research source for example you might start an email correspondence with a professor you admire when legal issues or questions come up in your graduate study you might write to them for advice if you have an idea for an article for a law journal write to a professor who has done research in that area and ask for advice or assistance this will ensure that the professors you get recommendations from are familiar with the type of research you want to pursue as a professor get substantial practical experience after law school if you re considering being a professor based on your practical experience you want to become an expert at whatever legal niche you practice professors hired based on their experience typically are clinical professors but some also teach academic classes in niche subjects such as entertainment law 25 x research source the type of law firm you practice at doesn t matter as much if you re following this path you might even start your own firm which can be especially helpful if you re practicing in an area of law that people regularly need such as criminal law or family law keep your practice focus as narrow as possible and tied to the type of law school classes you ultimately want to teach for example if you want to teach criminal law you might work as a defense attorney publish articles in practice journals and academic journals law schools typically look down on practice journals or trade magazines however if you re trying to become a law professor based on your experience publication in practical journals helps bolster your reputation as an expert 26 x research source you might also consider writing a book or chapter for a nonfiction book related to your area of legal expertise if you get your name out there by publishing in journals a lot these types of opportunities may come up make yourself available as a legal commentator to gain name recognition start with your local news station send over your résumé with a letter and explain what issues you re available to discuss as a commentator in many places good local legal commentators are in high demand so it shouldn t take long before you re contacted 27 x research source if you live in a larger city it might be a little more difficult to get established as a legal commentator even on local news stations you might start with smaller towns nearby you can also establish a name for yourself as a commentator by starting a blog or writing articles and submitting them to local news outlets teach as an adjunct professor while practicing law you can enhance your reputation as an expert as well as gain teaching experience by working as an adjunct professor adjuncts typically only teach one class a semester usually in a niche area such as entertainment or environmental law that they also practice 28 x research source teaching as an adjunct is typically easier if you have your own law firm because you can adjust your client intake to make time for the class while teaching even one class can take up significant time and resources make sure you can keep up with your writing and publications at the same time if you want to get hired in a full time tenure track faculty position publications are essential regardless of which path you take to get there 29 x research source make friends with law professors contact law professors who teach the same area of law that you practice or an area that intersects with your practice you might send a journal article you ve written by way of introduction or offer to come and speak to their students about your practice 30 x research source for example if you practice music law you might reach out to copyright or intellectual property law professors and ask if you could come to their class to discuss the different copyright and trademark aspects you encounter in your practice if you want to become a law professor not only practitioners but also professors must view you as an expert in your field the recommendations from these law professors will make it much more likely for you to get a position on a law school faculty,Education-and-Communications

how to teach literature to college students,teaching a college literature course for the first time can be intimidating however if you are well prepared the idea of teaching college literature class should start to sound fun and exciting to teach literature to college students you will need to incorporate strategies that work at the college level find ways to maintain a positive class environment develop a teaching strategy that is comfortable for you and design a course that meets your department s requirements,motivate students to do the reading with quizzes one of the biggest challenges of teaching college literature is getting your students to come to class prepared one way to motivate your students to do the readings and come to class ready to discuss them is to give daily reading quizzes 1 x research source you can either create simple short answer quizzes or assign writing prompts that will test your students knowledge of the reading give these quizzes at the beginning of every class you may even incorporate the quizzes into your class discussions such as by asking students to share their answers make sure that you give an adequate amount of points for the quizzes and responses for example if the quizzes for the entire semester are only worth 5 of the overall grade then some students may not see these as worthy of their time and effort instead consider making the quizzes worth around 20 to 30 of the total grade require students to come to class with questions another option to motivate students to do the assigned readings is to require students to come to class with questions about the reading you can then use your students questions to kick off the class discussion for example you might require your students to bring in a set of three discussion questions per class and invite students to ask questions at random then you could also collect the questions at the end of the class and give points to students who completed the questions make sure that you explain how to write a good discussion question before you start requiring your students to bring in questions explain to students that good discussion questions should be open ended they should not result in a yes or no answer or a single answer such as what was the name of mrs dalloway s visitor instead a good question might be something like what is the significance of the lines from shakespeare s cymbeline that mrs dalloway reads do these lines seem to have importance to anyone else but her why or why not provide participation opportunities within lectures if you give a lecture make sure that you include a participation opportunity about every seven to 10 minutes these opportunities should allow your students to respond discuss or ask questions about the material some good strategies that you might use include asking questions for example while reading mrs dalloway you might ask your students something like what is the purpose of an internal dialogue having students share a similar experience with a neighbor while reading mrs dalloway you could encourage students to identify something that they have in common with clarissa or another character requesting that students paraphrase a concept that was just described if you introduce a theoretical concept that sheds light on the text you are reading then you might request that your students break into pairs or small groups and attempt to put the concept into their own words incorporate theory at the college level students should be exposed to literary theory if your department has a specific course meant to introduce students to theory then you may be able to request that students incorporate theory into papers or presentations if not then you may need to provide some instruction to help students understand and use literary theory for example you could require students to craft discussion questions that incorporate a specific type of literary theory such as feminist psychoanalytic or marxist theory or you could assign different schools of literary theory to individual students or small groups and require them to develop an analysis of a text using that theory discuss specific passages with your students close reading is essential when teaching literature at the college level so make sure that you devote plenty of class time to close reading try to pick one passage per class or invite a student to pick one passage per class and focus on it for 15 to 20 minutes for example you might invite one student per class to read a favorite paragraph aloud and invite the rest of the class to discuss that paragraph 2 x research source you can also ask other students to point to other areas of the text that connect with the first student s chosen paragraph as a way to deepen the conversation turn in class discussions into in class writing assignments some passages may be too difficult for students to develop a response on the spot in these situations you can always direct your students to free write to help them generate ideas for example if you notice that students are struggling to comment on a passage or that the discussion is limited to only a handful of students give them five to 10 minutes to free write about the passage avoid filling the silence with your voice keep in mind that there will be times when your students are silent but it is usually because they are struggling with a question or concept allow them some time to struggle silently rather than giving them your answers include group activities some students will not feel comfortable speaking up in class at least early on therefore it is helpful to include small group activities into your classes so that all students have the opportunity to contribute to class discussions including group activities or cooperative learning in your classroom can also benefit students by providing them with the opportunity to learn from their peers 3 x research source you might begin some of your classes by dividing your students into groups and assigning them a question about the day s reading or you might ask students to focus on a particular passage or chapter and develop some ideas and or questions to add to the class discussion for example if you are reading mrs dalloway then you might start the class by asking students how does virginia woolf transition from one character s point of view to another find an example from the text to support your answer use scaffolding to teach difficult skills scaffolding is when you teach students to do something that is one level beyond their abilities and then support them through the task the students should develop mastery over the skill after practicing it a few times and then you can remove the support 4 x research source for example you might introduce close reading by guiding your students through a close reading of a passage during one class then provide your students with chances to do the same during class time then you might ask your students to do a close reading of a passage outside of class and write about it in a paper model skills and strategies in the classroom your students will often observe you and emulate the skills that you model for them in your class therefore it is important that you model the types of skills that you want your students to learn 5 x research source for example you might model good questions for your students with the questions that you ask in class or you might model good writing for your students by showing your students a paper that you wrote while you were a student ask questions asking questions can help students to connect what they have read with their own knowledge and experiences it is especially important to ask questions that will help your students make connections between the readings and their own lives 6 x research source make sure that you ask your students some thoughtful questions during classes to help them find effective ways to enter the conversation focus on open answer questions rather than yes no and other single answer questions ask questions that start with why and how if you do ask any single answer questions then make sure that you invite students to say more by asking why and how questions for example if you have just finished reading mrs dalloway by virginia woolf then you might ask your students something like how does woolf tell the story and what does this format reveal about the way we narrate our own lives use visual aids using images films and other visual aids can be quite beneficial for students who are more visual learners no matter what your preferred form of teaching you should consider incorporating some kind of visual aid into your classes this can range from high tech such as a powerpoint to low tech such as notes and doodles on the whiteboard for example creating a powerpoint that pairs difficult concepts with images may help some students to gain understanding of a book that a spoken lecture might not films can also be helpful aids to include for example you might use a film to provide a compliment to a complicated scene in a book or as a point of comparison after the class has finished reading a book encourage your students to maintain a positive environment in your literature class you will have to offer your students encouragement for contributing to the discussion this can just be a simple thanks for bringing that up after a student finishes a comment or question or you can offer more personal responses for example you might say something like i wondered the same thing when i first read mrs dalloway thank your students at the end of each class for their participation as well for example you might say something like i really enjoyed our discussion today thank you all for contributing such excellent ideas avoid criticizing your students interpretations or shutting them down if something is unclear if something that a student says is unclear then you can prompt the student to clarify by asking something like that is an interesting thought why do you say that or it seems like you are wrestling with a difficult concept do you want to expand or open up the topic to the rest of the class avoid praising the quality of a question saying that you think a question is good might lead others to think that their questions are not good therefore try to avoid this type of praise instead stick to remarks that will encourage students you can even use non verbal encouragement such as smiling nodding your head or giving a thumbs up work with a mentor some departments may assign you a mentor to help you as you begin to teach if your department does not assign you a mentor then you might consider choosing someone for yourself choose someone who you think is well suited to help you develop your teaching skills for example if you are a medievalist then you might ask another medievalist in your department if he or she would be willing to serve as your mentor however having the same scholarly interests is not a requirement for a good mentor you might simply choose someone who you think would make a good mentor because of his or her personality and experience 7 x research source develop your knowledge of pedagogy you can improve your knowledge of pedagogy and what works for teaching literature by attending conferences and by reading articles about teaching literature try to view presentations and read articles that connect with the texts you are teaching for example if you are teaching shakespeare s titus andronicus you can read journal articles about the most successful pedagogical strategies for teaching this work or if you attend an author specific conference such as a virginia woolf conference then you might try to attend pedagogy presentations that discuss teaching woolf in general or a specific text such as the waves or orlando reflect on your favorite professors think back to the professors that taught your favorite college literature courses to start getting some ideas for teaching strategies some questions you might ask yourself include what teaching methods did your favorite professors use in class what did you like about these teaching methods how did these methods help you to understand and discuss difficult texts what if anything would you change about these methods if you decide to use them in your class identify your strengths based on past teaching experiences you may already have a sense of what you excel at in the classroom for example you might be really good at making and giving powerpoint presentations or facilitating class discussions or developing interesting group activities make a list of your strengths in the classroom as well as any other personal strengths that you think might lead you towards some effective teaching strategies ask colleagues for suggestions your more experienced colleagues are excellent resources for learning about teaching strategies and getting lesson plan ideas whether you are a graduate assistant who is just starting to teach or a tenure track professor you can learn something new from a more experienced member of your department try setting up a meeting with someone who also teaches literature in your department ask for suggestions on what works feedback on your current ideas resources that might help you and general advice consider asking to observe other literature classes to see how other teachers encourage discussion write out your teaching philosophy a teaching philosophy communicates your goals and values as a teacher creating a teaching philosophy may even help you to develop your teaching skills so it is a good idea to write out your teaching philosophy even if you do not need to most teaching philosophies include 8 x research source your ideas about teaching and learning a description of the strategies that you use to teach an explanation of why you teach the way that you do check the departmental requirements your english department might have specific guidelines for the course you are teaching so it is important to check before you start designing your course for example you might be required to teach specific texts give certain assignments or incorporate specific concepts ask your department chair or another supervisor if you can see other professors syllabi to get ideas about how your course should look use these syllabi to help you determine how you can meet the department s requirements for the course consider choosing a theme if you are teaching a special course for your department then you may already have a theme however you can always add a theme for even more focus if the course does not have a theme then you may find it easier to identify readings and craft assignments by choosing a theme some common literature course themes include 9 x research source african american literature author courses such as shakespeare chaucer or dickens family food gender myth rural or urban literature symbolism time periods such as the 20th century the enlightenment or the renaissance types of literature such as poetry short stories drama or novels utopian or dystopian literature women writers make a list of books and other texts once you have identified your theme start listing potential texts that you could teach for that course this list may include far more books or other works than you could realistically teach just keep in mind that you can narrow down your list later on you can also ask colleagues for suggestions someone who has taught for a long time might be able to suggest texts that work really well for the course you are teaching for example if you wanted to teach a course that focuses on women writers then you might include on your list works by virginia woolf sylvia plath toni morrison and zora neale hurston develop a reading schedule once you have decided on the works that you will include in your course you will need to develop a reading schedule first decide what order you would like your students to read the texts then you can devise a schedule for how much of each text you will read each week consider the length of the texts as you develop your reading schedule for books and other long works you will need to break the readings into manageable sections for short works such as poems or short stories you may be able to read the entire piece for one class choose assignments most literature classes require students to write at least one paper but you can also include different types of assignments for example you might also include presentations discussion leading activities or quizzes and exams make sure that you check the course requirements to determine what if any assignments are required by your department,Education-and-Communications

how to become a college professor,teaching at a university is a rewarding career but with a declining number of available positions becoming a college professor isn t easy more than 70 percent of all college faculty currently teach off the tenure track meaning their future at the university is not stable 1 x research source for many adjunct professors getting an advanced degree is a path into poverty more than 33 000 ph d holders are currently on public assistance 2 x research source think very carefully before embarking on a path to become a professor,succeed in high school if you know in high school that you would like to become a college professor then get the highest grades possible so you can gain admission into an excellent undergraduate institution reputable graduate programs often accept applicants from similarly reputable colleges and universities 3 x research source set a clear study schedule for yourself and plan out your assignments weeks in advance if you plan ahead now you will establish the necessary time management skills you will need in college divide your time into manageable chunks don t plan for large chunks of time like 4 or 5 hours because it might be harder to maintain that level of attention and commitment instead create manageable 1 2 hours blocks of time to study and complete projects study for your standardized tests your sat and act scores are a key part of your application package you can find study tips and practice tests at the college board s web site you should study for a few months before the test don t cram for it the night before you can also check out test prep books at you local library take prep courses offered by companies like pearson and kaplan or look into studying with a private tutor 4 x research source research undergraduate programs with successful graduates many college departments will list how many students gain acceptance to graduate school on their web site you can also ask an admissions officer how many students go onto ph d programs from their university s department consider the size and scope of your university small liberal arts colleges are great for getting a personalized attention but they tend not to have the resources for archival research provided by larger universities 5 x research source similarly with a larger university you will need to work extra hard to become known to your professors since many of them will teach very large survey courses or they will only teach upper level courses and graduate courses attend department events and stop by your professor s office hours to express your interest in the material and discuss specific projects this will help your professors get to know you when they have hundreds of other students if you are planning to attend a large university you should also look into joining an honors college within the university as this will give you a smaller cohort and more individual attention 6 x research source perform well in college your performance in your undergraduate program will be the major factor that your graduate committee will consider when they admit you make sure you manage your course load so you can balance your responsibilities anything more than four reading intensive courses each semester will be difficult to manage 7 x research source don t overload courses you will need to strengthen your reading skills in college as most graduate programs require you to analyze an intensive amount of reading material but don t feel pressure to cram extra courses into each semester talk to your advisor about the recommended amount of courses to take for your graduate school aspirations maintain a high gpa you should have a generally high gpa but in the courses of your major most graduate programs will expect you to earn grades of an a a or a if you have consistently earned c s ds or failed courses in your major then graduate school might not be for you 8 x research source work or volunteer as a tutor this could be in a position in your school s writing center or you could tutor students at a local high school in most graduate programs you will be expected to do some form of teaching and tutoring while you are an undergrad will indicate your interest in this role 9 x research source work or volunteer in a professor s laboratory many professors need and welcome undergraduates into their labs to do some of the basic tasks of research the professor will likely write you a letter of recommendation and give you valuable advice for applying to graduate schools take an internship an internship will give you valuable professional experience and will allow you to learn outside the space of a classroom it will also help you to build a professional network outside of academia talk to your university s career center for tips on finding a rewarding internship 10 x research source build up other skills while being a strong reader and writer are essential skills for most graduate programs you should consider developing other skills that can translate inside and outside of academia 11 x research source consider taking a web development class and an introductory data analysis or statistics course these courses will give you vital technological and quantitative skills that will translate into a variety of professions not just graduate school take a graduate level course in your senior year consider enrolling in a graduate level course if your school offers a master s or ph d program this will give you a sense of the level of work required by a more advanced degree 12 x research source if your advisor is offering a graduate level course ask them if you think you should enroll in it this will let them know that you are interested in graduate study think about why you want to go to graduate school in order to become a college professor most departments require you to have a ph d before you begin the application process which is very time consuming you should think deeply about why you want to attend especially when the promise of job security after you graduate with a ph d is very unlikely 13 x research source are you afraid to go on the job market after graduating with your b a do you not know of anything else to do these are not good reasons to go to graduate school even if you have a genuine passion for your discipline and want to study if further consider if you would be willing to do this after ten years of very hard work with little pay and no job security 14 x research source research different programs particularly research how many of their graduates have been placed in tenure track jobs in the past ten years if the department doesn t supply this information on their web site this is a red flag 15 x research source you should aim to apply for 10 15 programs aim high when you apply only 50 of all ivy league ph ds go on to earn tenure track jobs and the percentage decreases at lower tier programs going to a very prestigious school will help your chances of getting a tenure track job 16 x research source find potential advisors in graduate school you will work much more closely with your advisor than in undergrad you should look for faculty members who have the title of associate professor or just professor this means they have tenure and they have a stable future at the university if a faculty member has a title of assistant professor or visiting assistant professor then this means they are only tenure track or on a limited term appointment do not pick them as an advisor as their future at the university is uncertain as most ph d programs last between 5 7 years you will need someone who will be at the university for a long time to support you and approve your dissertation 17 x research source take the time to read that professor s research don t just peruse their interests as they are listed on the faculty web site read articles and books by them to see what kinds of contributions they have made to their field consider the funding options don t go into significant debt for a ph d unlike a j d or an m d degree the ph d generally does not offer very lucrative careers that can pay down large amounts of debt the average salary of a tenure track assistant professor is 53 000 the average salary of adjunct professors is 25 000 27 000 although it can be much lower your ph d program should at least cover tuition and should also provide some sort of living stipend 18 x research source if you already have significant debt from your undergraduate degree you should consider if it is worth it to take on additional debt for another degree or if it might be worth to spend a few years paying down your debt 19 x research source many programs offer funding through teaching assistantships or instructor positions beware of programs that want you to begin teaching in your first year of coursework or programs that want you to teach more than one course a semester a heavy teaching load will make it difficult for you to finish your research look for grants on the u s department of education s web site or for grants offered for graduate students by your professional organization such as american psychological association 20 x research source make an application timeline after you have decided which 10 15 programs you want to apply to make a timeline including all the relevant information for each application when is the due date for each application do they all require the same materials or do some require different components such as a portfolio you should start the application process a few months before each due date talk to your advisors and let them know you are thinking of applying to graduate school ask them if they will be able to write letters of recommendation for you you should make a formal request for a letter of recommendation at least a month before the application is due at the beginning of the fall semester of your senior year or in august if you have graduated contact your university s career for any guidance on applying to graduate school they will have lots of guidance and can help you network with alumnae who have gone on to graduate school study for the gre or graduate records examination most ph d programs require the gre they often also require a gre subject test in your area as with the sat you should give yourself time to study and practice taking this test do not cram in the night or week before the test look for prep test courses and study guides offered by your university s career center you can also study with guide books takes practice tests offered through educational testing service or look into using a tutor to help you prepare 21 x trustworthy source educational testing service educational and testing assessment organization responsible for administering various standardized exams such as the gre and the toefl go to source in most major cities the gre is offered year round when taken on the computer the fee for taking the test is 195 and can be paid on line with most major credit or debit cards at educational testing service s web site prepare your personal statement your cover letter should clearly state your professional interests in the program and which field of study you would like to pursue most graduate programs require some form of specialization i e if you study history you will have to choose a geographical and historical specialization like early american history before the civil war clearly state which faculty members you want to work with in your cover letter explain how their research interests align with yours discuss which experiences in your background make you prepared to study this field avoid making any cliche statements such as sentences that start with the phrase i always knew i wanted to teach this subject or ever since i was a child i loved reading instead focus on what research questions you are interested in exploring in the program obsessively proofread your cover letter if you include any typos or grammatical errors this will indicate to the committee that you are either a weak writer or a lazy one don t let you entire application be thrown out over something that is easily fixable 22 x research source learn more at our guide to writing a personal statement for grad school submit a stellar writing sample your writing sample should be flawless and meet the page requirements as stipulated in the application do not include a shorter or longer sample this is a quick way to get your application dismissed 23 x research source make sure the writing sample is a reflection of your research interests if you want to study ancient egyptian art but your writing sample is on the impressionist movement in the late 19th century then this will not give the committee a clear idea of your research strengths work with your college s writing center to get feedback on your writing sample does it make sense to someone who doesn t know very much about the subject of your research is it clearly written 24 x research source as with your personal statement make sure your writing sample is grammatically pristine and contains no typos be polite after you have submitted your application be patient when waiting to hear back most graduate school applications are due in late fall early winter but you may not hear back until the middle of the spring semester do not harass the department administrative assistant for updates on the status of your application this is a quick way to get rejected the school will let you know if your application has been accepted or rejected visit the campus some programs require their applicants to interview before they admit them you should participate in this interview if only to get a more in depth sense of the program and how it supports its graduate students 25 x research source many other programs will offer visiting weekends for students who have been accepted once you have narrowed your choices down to 3 4 options try to visit at the schools you are most interested in meet with the faculty members you want to study with on your visit are they interested in working with you do they have no clue who you are do they seem to be the most popular advisor in the department perhaps working with too many graduate students if you answer yes to the latter two questions that might be a sign this department wouldn t be the best fit for you ask questions from current students in your program who work with the faculty members you want to work with does the faculty member support his or her advisees will she provide feedback on your research in a timely manner does she encourage students to attend conferences or meet colleagues she knows at other institutions does she help students to get published in reputable journals consider other factors about the institution is the university in a very small college town or is it in a bustling expensive city is this a place that you would be happy to live in for 5 7 years how will you be able to afford to live in this place on a graduate student stipend if you can try to stay with a current graduate student when you visit that way you will get a sense of what kind of housing grad students can afford can they live on their own in a nice neighborhood or do they have to have multiple roommates is it easy to find an apartment in the city or is the rental market really competitive ace your coursework for the first couple years in your program you will likely be required to take a range of courses try to focus on taking classes with the faculty members you want to advise your dissertation taking a class with a faculty member will give them a sense of your strengths and interests read strategically you will have an overwhelming amount of reading to complete in graduate school perhaps multiple books each week as you read take in depth notes and highlight the most important sections or moments from each text 26 x research source you can also generally get a reading list from your professor or find the book list on the course schedule in the summer or winter break before the class starts completing some of this reading ahead of time will give you a lighter load for when you are mired in work during the semester in your first and second years you should attend as many department events as you can talks from current faculty and visiting scholars graduate student presentations department parties etc this will show your investment in your professional setting join the academic conversation in your first and second years you should spend time familiarizing yourself with your academic field spend a couple hours each week reading the major academic journals in your field if you don t know what these are ask your advisor or a faculty member in that field this will give you a sense of the broader conversations happening in your discipline join your professional organization you should join early in your career in graduate school and maintain your membership most organizations offer reduced membership fees for graduate students if you are studying english or a romance language this will be the mla modern language association or the american psychological association if you are in a psychology department in your third or fourth years of the program you should plan to attend the major conference hosted by this institution make publishing a priority most tenure track jobs even at less research focused institutions now require applicants to have published at least one article scientific disciplines often expect an even more extensive publication record since most papers contain multiple authors join a writing group in your department or start one if it does not already exist that will give you deadlines for turning a paper you wrote for your course work or qualifying exams into a piece of criticism 27 x research source remember that the process for publishing can take a long time some journals might take months before they let you know if they have accepted rejected or requested that you revise and resubmit your article after that it could take even longer before it appears in print if you want to have a publication by the fourth year in your program then start to prepare it in your second year 28 x research source ask your advisor for guidance on which journal you should send your article to some journals do not publish graduate students as a rule whereas others are more welcoming toward junior scholarship gain teaching experience teaching experience will prepare you for the daily responsibilities of a college professor many ph d programs have teaching opportunities built into their programs where you will often teach freshmen or sophomore level courses or leading a lab for a large section of an introductory course 29 x trustworthy source association for psychological science nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences go to source if these opportunities are not built into your program then you may need to apply for teaching opportunities talk to your advisor about the best way to secure a teaching appointment look into taking a teaching assistant position in these positions you generally assist a professor with things like grading taking attendance and helping students during group work in class but make sure that you have the opportunity to contribute some of your knowledge to the course just working as a grader might not give you enough professional experience to be a teacher 30 x trustworthy source association for psychological science nonprofit organization devoted promoting trustworthy research and education in the psychological sciences go to source save lesson plans syllabi student evaluations and lecture notes for your teaching portfolio these will be necessary documents for when you apply for a tenure track job consider interdisciplinary certificate programs many graduate schools will offer certificate programs for graduate students in other departments that supplement your core interests as a scholar popular options often include programs in women and gender studies american studies writing and rhetoric non profit management digital humanities on line teaching and learning instructional design etc completing a certificate in one of these programs could make you a more competitive candidate for jobs inside and outside academia than applicants who just have a degree in one field design a compelling dissertation the most complicated component of the ph d program is writing and defending a dissertation which is a book length research project most departments will require that you submit a proposal at the beginning of the writing process for your topic when you finish writing it you will have to defend your work in front of a committee of faculty members who have read it 31 x research source set up a clear easy to follow writing schedule with frequent deadlines some programs will give you a year of funding to write you dissertation you should have at least a couple chapters completed before you embark on this break down your time into manageable chunks give yourself one or two hour blocks of time with achievable goals like adding an extra three pages to your introduction or analyzing in an extra scholarly source 32 x research source maintain clear communication with your advisor as you are writing don t fall off of your advisor s radar they should approve each chapter as you go plan to check in with them every 2 3 weeks during the writing process so they get a sense of your progress schedule your defense far in advance once you have completed your dissertation most ph d programs require you have somewhere between 4 6 faculty members to conduct a defense of your work they will ask you critical questions about the strength of your arguments and also offer other perspectives on your work coordinating the schedules of multiple academics can be tricky in many departments the administrative assistant will coordinate the schedules of your readers establish a date and time and book a room for you but you should contact him early in the semester you plan to defend to do this 33 x research source to prepare for your defense re read important moments in your dissertation introduction conclusion and the thesis statements of each chapter so you can quickly and eloquently respond with the key points of your argument take a deep breath and remember that no one knows your work better than you you have spent years with this material and you have every ability to defend it successfully 34 x research source go on the job market most tenure track jobs are posted in the fall semester of the academic year before they are meant to begin they will generally have the title of assistant professor 35 x research source job postings for tenure track jobs are often listed on the web site of your major professional organization like the modern language association or computer research association or other places like higheredjobs the chronicle of higher education and h net most academic candidates go on the market in the last year of their program when they are still abd all but dissertation you should plan to have defended your dissertation and earned your degree by the time the tenure track job begins in the fall of the next academic year you will generally need many of the same documents that you used to get into graduate school a cover letter personal statement a c v listing your academic accomplishments such as publications or teaching awards a writing sample letters of recommendation from your advisors etc you also will be frequently required to present a teaching portfolio consisting of things like student evaluations lesson plans a statement of your teaching philosophy etc survive the job interview interviews for tenure track jobs are notoriously rigorous first you may have to pass preliminary interviews conducted at the conference hosted by your major professional organization you may also have a phone or skype interview which will be less expensive to attend than traveling to the professional conference 36 x research source you will generally be asked questions about your research what contributions do you make to the field how did you become interested in your topic etc you will also be asked questions about teaching such as how you structure a lesson plan or how you manage a large survey class you should have tangible examples to provide when you get these questions 37 x research source after you pass the preliminary round of interviews you will be asked to come on a campus interview the campus interview generally lasts 2 3 days you will travel to campus and may be required to do some of the following things give an extended talk 25 50 minutes on your research interests lead a class to demonstrate your teaching interests and conduct multiple smaller interviews with members of the job search committee or other faculty members 38 x research source always express interest in the research of other faculty members while you are on your visit you want to make it clear that you are a helpful congenial potential colleague 39 x research source you also will be required to meet with the chair of your department the dean of your college and possibly other administrative figures these interviews generally take place in the spring semester before the fall semester when they plan to hire you prepare for tenure review once you have been hired most institutions expect to assess faculty members for tenure within seven years of starting as an assistant professor however they will often require pre tenure review within the first two years of appointment and then again in the fourth of fifth years departments have different requirements for tenure review once tenure is awarded the professor has a secure future at the university barring any major financial crisis and the professor can enjoy a lifelong career teaching students in the subject of their expertise for the humanities you often have to publish at least one book with a reputable academic press and or multiple articles in well respected journals for the sciences you have to receive funding from an institution like the national institutes of health or the national science foundation to start a lab and procure the equipment need to conduct your experiments writing and winning grants for this has become increasingly difficult especially with major financial cuts to these institutions 40 x research source learn the culture of your department as you are preparing to apply for tenure consider where you should focus your energies does the department value research or teaching more if it values research resist the urge to spend extra time mentoring students or planning events for students in the department put that time into conducting research 41 x research source similarly if the department mostly values commitment to students as frequently is the case as liberal arts colleges and community colleges then put more of your focus on advising and supporting students consider serving as the advisor to a student group in your department always talk to your chair or dean about the expectations for tenure at your university most schools want to improve their national profile which means that the will value research from your first year forward work as hard as you can to meet those expectations maintain the appropriate records for your tenure review you will often be required to produce an extensive file of documents cataloguing your successes in the department these often include 42 x research source student evaluations and evidence of your teaching record lesson plans syllabi etc copies of all of your publications or any technical documents creative projects letters from scholars at other institutions which assess the value of your research a log of your service to your institution any additional certifications you have earned after you have compiled your dossier the tenured members of your department will vote on whether or not to recommend you for tenure your file will also be sent out to other faculty members from other departments for review the final decision will be made by the president provost or chancellor at your university 43 x research source go on the job market with the increasing scarcity of tenure track jobs more ph d holders are taking limited term or contingent faculty positions non tenure track professors currently make up more than 70 of all teaching positions in the american university some of these titles include 44 x research source post doctoral research fellow visiting assistant professor lecturer often with different levels such as lecturer i or ii or senior lecturer adjunct the first two categories of jobs can sometimes be found posted during the fall alongside tenure track jobs but they are also regularly posted during the spring and throughout the academic year lecturer and adjunct positions are often interviewed closer to the start of the upcoming school year in which they are needed interview for a ntt job the interview process for these jobs can be very similar to a tenure track job you may have to go on a campus visit and give a presentation but the focus will probably be more on your teaching abilities than your research beware of post doc positions that have heavy teaching loads such as a 4 4 a post doc is meant to help you turn your dissertation into a book manuscript to publish if the position requires you to have a heavy teaching load you might not be able to accomplish this 45 x research source understand the perils of adjuncting with the rising costs of tuition and the growth of administrative salaries many schools have turned to adjuncting to cover the bulk of their teaching needs 46 x research source adjuncts are ph d holders who are often kept on a part time basis so they do not receive benefits or health insurance from the university they are not paid a salary but rather on a per course fee which averages 2700 00 currently adjuncts make up more than 50 of the current college faculty workforce and they earn on average 25 000 27 000 a year 47 x research source because institutions are hesitant to grant adjuncts course loads that would make them full time employees many adjuncts are forced to teach at multiple schools in any given semester they might have long commutes to get to many different campuses departments are also likely to cut courses at the last minute leaving adjuncts to scramble to find other ways to supplement a meager salary working as an adjunct provides very little job security consider other career options you might decide that working long hours for little pay no health insurance and no stability is not for you in this case you should spend part of your graduate career preparing for a life off the tenure track or even out of academia altogether 48 x research source build up a portfolio of non academic writing you can volunteer to edit medical or technical documents write grants for a non profit in your area or freelance for a local magazine or newspaper but you should have a body of writing that translates outside of academia prepare to revise your job search materials while a c v is supposed to be multiple pages in length a resume should be no longer than one a cover letter should be just one page also 49 x research source you must learn how to communicate your transferrable skills if you lead a lab you have project management skills if you wrote and structured your dissertation then you have excellent organizational prowess 50 x research source think of alternative career paths many ph d s go on to have successful careers in industry non profits teaching at private high schools researching in

how to be a history professor,if you love history or if you just need a job or for whatever reason here is how to be a history professor,know that history like other branches of human intellectual activities is a vast and ramified subject everything has a history and people do scholarly works on that part of the history some good examples are history of cooking history of mathematics history of painting history of ceramics history of musics know that the specialized histories of those disciplines normally will be taught and studied by people inside that specific subject to be able to judge value of historical events of that subject for example to teach the history of music one should be well familiar with music though perhaps not as much as an accomplished musician evaluate your own expertise if you like to engage in one of the specialised types of history if you are working on the art of painting as a hobby you can start study history of painting to apply for teaching have a brief study of history of painting from cave paintings to greeks and romans ancient hindi chines japanese paintings africans and native americans paintings painting in middle ages europe stained glass painting and story telling of churches mosaic paintings of islamic cultures middle eastern miniatures and mongols of india emergence of perspective and renaissance painting continue until you get to present time abstraction graphical arts digital arts and so on this takes a couple of volume that one might enjoy during his spare time in few months select a period that attracts you more say expressionists era dig deeper in their rise their message their fight and dominance and evolution and at last leaving the arena to a new style select one of them and study his time and life and his works and significance of him write six thousands words about this group include almost half of it around the selected character if reached to this point you are ready to go ahead for becoming a teacher in that field use flashcards gradually you become convinced that without using flashcards and dedicating more commitment you cannot progress much as a future teacher of history you cannot refrain using the main tools of academic works notice that you have started to grow a desire to extend your study to near disciplines such as history of sculptors architectures of nations fine arts in general as frequently you encounter a crosstalk among these that make you frustrated of carving out a section out of them know that even in specialised histories one gradually becomes interested in studying general history as one cannot separate a human activity from the events that surround it social dynamism of human is woven together from the threads and strings which look diverse at the first sight but not at the reality wars and natural disasters hinder the arts and kings and rulers can encourage and help them to flourish that might take you to a new decision decide if you are interested in general history rather than or on the side of the specialised subject note that you might bypass the previous steps if from the beginning your desire is study of general history hence put yourself in the crucible of test know that in our modern time there is almost a recent foot step to begin study general history of man you might have your own philosophical ideological taste to select from a range of general history books but the one recommended here is one of the most read and readable get the story of civilization by will and ariel durant this book is available on different formats even free pdf and also in audio forms that you can listen on your mp3 device while driving or travelling to school or work best is to use both format decide if you are a good story teller you should be able to tell by heart a movie that you have seen to a friend or a member of family you should remember all the details and do not skip over them volunteer in a school to help teaching of verbal intensive subjects such as history geography sociology literature and creative writing students of these subjects expect their teachers not to use notes and be talkative you can start as an assistant for having any job that deals with younger people you need a clean police check avoid memorizing anything one cannot teach by memorizing you should study all the time such that in the classroom students only get the overflow of your boiling knowledge remember generally a good teacher does not perform he creates and delivers in the arena go to crucible again study part of the will durant s that you like most select certain period of time and certain geopolitical entity of that period study that part with few chapters from important references available in public or school library write down some six seven thousand about that events you should be able to remember relations of people and events and the roots and aftermaths of those events use mind maps parallel to flashcards you need to use vastly mind maps for your own study and when you are teaching take one course in sociology most of the modern teaching of history consists of social history and social analysis of events modern history does not look to events as separate adventures of certain kings rulers and characters in contrast it studies history as a living evolving social phenomenon therefore you need to have a minimum familiarity with sociology and its terminology per se then you can use it into your historical intellectualism be surprised gradually you feel that you recognise yourself in a strange way more knowledgeable than average become humble go into a large university library and look in shelves of history books with thousands of tomes and volumes of works done by your predecessors and see if you will be able to add a page a chapter or a volume to them get the required formal education typically this means you have to graduate from a college or university in addition you may need a degree to teach at college level a degree in history will demonstrate your commitment to the field and dedication to academic work your school might require that you pass certain curriculum in teacher training besides your degree in history apply for a job with the local school departments if accepted teach the courses according to the school s

offer you at the time in this case you ll typically need to respond by april 15 keep in mind that the best offer may be somewhere far from where you currently live you will probably have to consider moving perhaps far across the country to pursue a degree take courses as with any other graduate program the first part of your gender studies program will involve taking courses in or related to the field you will typically have an advisor who can help you choose the best courses for you based on where you are at in the program and what topics interest you most your coursework is an opportunity to both learn more about the field and develop relationships with the faculty when it comes time to choose your advisor choose carefully you will work with this person closely throughout your graduate

period you ll have a few hours or days to produce essays on questions related to those topics depending on the program you attend you might or might not know in advance what the questions will be write a thesis and or dissertation a gender studies program will require you to write either a thesis or dissertation or in some cases both a master s thesis and then later a doctoral dissertation this is essentially a long paper based on an original research project the process of writing a thesis or dissertation is a collaborative one you ll work with committee of professors to develop your research and writing writing a dissertation can take months or even years your dissertation will typically be the most important way that schools will evaluate you and your academic identity when you are applying for jobs start thinking about this and having conversations with your advisor about your ideas as early in the program as you can 11 x research source defend your thesis dissertation the

as the websites of professional associations you may have joined such as the national women s studies association 14 x research source or other websites dedicated entirely to higher education job postings 15 x research source apply and interview for jobs view job postings carefully and be sure your materials cover everything requested in the posting if your application catches the search

how to lecture well,lecturing is a teaching method in which one speaker addresses an audience for an extended period of time for educational purposes most often used in higher education but also prevalent in professional cultural and other settings lectures can present a challenge to people with little public speaking experience these steps will teach you how to prepare for your lecture how to begin a lecture and how to keep an audience engaged,choose a few main points for your lecture your audience will learn more effectively if the information presented is organized around key themes allowing them to relate smaller details to bigger ideas these themes should represent the main educational content of the lecture what you want the audience to learn in addition to whatever smaller details you provide generate examples that demonstrate these key points to facilitate the audience s retention these might be passages from a text historical examples selected data from a report etc choose examples which you can explain fully in a few minutes and which will help your audience to grasp the subject matter decide on a conclusion that you want your audience to draw from your lecture in contrast to the 1 to 3 key points this will be a question that you want your listeners to consider further a problem for further analysis or a thesis or proof that explains the information you have given earlier such a conclusion will help your audience retain the other details you include in your lecture prepare an introduction to the material that you have prepared consider something that will grab the audience s attention such as an anecdote or surprising fact design an outline or lecture notes that cover your lecture material these will allow you to organize your thoughts in a coherent manner that will be easier to listen to than a scattering of thoughts do not write out your lecture as this will lead you to read from your notes and have poor delivery instead provide general topic headings and a few key details or sentences that you want to include you should be able to speak freely off of this outline without pausing to review your notes if there are specific facts you want your audience to retain be sure to highlight these eliminate 10 to 20 percent of the material you have prepared thus far understanding that you will not be able to cover everything you want prepare any visual or audio aids that will help the audience grasp your lecture material examples might include a slideshow props a sample of music or a few images displayed on a board or screen visit the space in which you will be lecturing well in advance of the lecture make note of whiteboards lighting and other tools so that you do not seem unprepared or flustered when your lecture begins rehearse your lecture speak more slowly than you think you need to and aim to finish at least a few minutes before the lecture is scheduled to end so that your lecture can survive delays and distractions begin your lecture with the introduction you have prepared to grab your audience s attention move quickly from your anecdote or surprising fact to a summary of the information you are going to present so that your audience while engaged begins to learn immediately be sure to mention what the audience should retain from the lecture either a few broad themes or a collection of facts and ideas make sure that audience members have time to take notes if they wish do not pause for more than several seconds at a time and leave short pauses after major points continue speaking at a regular easy to follow pace exercise control over the audience in the form of speaking continually and demanding constant attention to help listeners focus make eye contact with all parts of the audience and use your hands for extra emphasis this will keep the audience s attention on you walk around in front of the audience not staying anchored to your lecture notes the more an audience is encouraged to pay attention to movement and change the less likely they are to sit back and be passive repeat and emphasize your major points to ensure that the audience grasps and remembers them restate all key facts especially numbers and dates watch to make sure that audience members have time to copy this information down relate your material to any visual aids you have prepared or previous material which has been discussed in the course or other lectures it will be easier for the audience to remember the content of the lecture if it is related to as many other sources as possible close by reviewing once again the lecture material you have presented and sending the audience away with a key message around which they can organize their thoughts leave time for questions either in front of the audience or after people have dispersed,Education-and-Communications
how to be a successful graduate assistant,graduate assistantships are coveted positions at universities that allow individuals the opportunity to work at the university while simultaneously taking courses towards an advanced degree most graduate assistants teach undergraduate classes perform research or do a combination of these two things if you want to be a successful graduate assistant it s important to get started on the right foot,set clear expectations and goals the most important thing you can do to help students succeed in your class is to clearly communicate to them what you expect them to learn and how you expect them to demonstrate their knowledge this will make the whole semester go much more smoothly a well outlined syllabus will help students understand the progression of the course clear course objectives will help you communicate what skills students need to acquire by what dates a grading rubric is a very useful tool the better you communicate the standards that you use to grade the less likely students will be to argue with you about their grades lecture effectively if you ve never taught a class before the thought of lecturing to a room full of students may be a little intimidating being prepared for each lecture and paying attention to the way you present yourself will make your lectures much more enjoyable for both you and your students plan ahead so that you will always know exactly what you will be lecturing on each day it s a good idea to practice your lecture so you can be reasonably sure that it will take up the entire class period without being rushed pay attention to the volume of your voice and the pace of your speech if you re talking too softly or too fast students may not be able to understand you you may want to consider asking a few students for feedback if you re not sure make use of the blackboard to write down important points in an organized fashion this will help students take coherent notes be sure that your handwriting is legible if possible circulate around the room instead of staying at your desk or behind your lectern this will make the students feel like you are more actively engaged encourage classroom discussion depending on the kind of class you are teaching you may want to incorporate classroom discussions into your syllabus to break up your lecturing this will give students the opportunity to debate their opinions and make their own connections to the course material this works especially well for small classes but you may be able to implement discussion even in larger groups if you have too many students for a whole class discussion consider breaking them into smaller groups letting students know before class that you will be having a class discussion about a particular topic will give them time to prepare which may make them more likely to participate make yourself available during office hours in addition to teaching classes you will likely also be required to hold office hours every week during which time students can come talk to you about their work it s a good idea to encourage students to come see you especially if they are struggling in your class when they do come be welcoming and offer helpful feedback to them to help them improve their performance if you find that no students are coming to your office hours you may want to consider making one appointment each semester mandatory this will give you the opportunity to get to know each student a bit better and it may make them more comfortable coming to see you in the future you may have to share an office with other graduate assistants so it s a good idea to work together to create a schedule that works for everyone grade fairly when it comes time to grade your students assignments always be objective and stick to your grading rubric it s a good idea to go over your grades with your mentor professor to make sure you both agree on the standards you are holding students to it s also important to grade in a timely manner grading can be time consuming but it s not fair to keep students waiting for weeks for their grades be professional in your dealings with students if you are interacting with undergraduate students as a part of your graduate assistantship it s important to approach these relationships professionally be sure to let them know that you are their teacher not their friend even if you are close to the same age don t flirt or get personal avoid adding your students as friends on social media if you have difficulties with a student in class immediately document the incident in an email to your supervisor it s also important to respect the confidentiality of your students personal information including grades 1 x research source be meticulous whether you are working in a lab

to make a good impression on your supervisor and demonstrate that you are a hard working graduate assistant you can do this by always showing up for work on time or early if your hours are flexible

respect including your peers your superiors your students and the support staff that you will be working with don t assume that you can call everyone by their first names call your superiors by their professional titles professor jones or dr yates unless they tell you otherwise avoid complaining during your time as a graduate assistant you will likely encounter at least one situation that aggravates you while you may be tempted to vent about it to other graduate assistants or university employees it s usually best to keep your complaints to yourself you do not want to be seen as a whiner especially if you are hoping to be re hired as a graduate assistant next year you may have to deal with equipment that is less than state of the art and it s important to make the best of this situation instead of complaining about the technology think of it as a good opportunity to hone your problem solving skills you may see inefficiencies in the way that your supervisor works but it s

that you be willing to do pretty much anything that is asked of you even if you do not enjoy a particular task agreeing to do it will help ensure that your supervisor values your contributions and it will help you develop skills that you will need in the future it s important not to go into a graduate assistantship with overly high expectations of the kind of work you will be doing as this may lead to disappointment you should expect to deal with at least some grunt work like grading papers or entering data try to see everything as a learning opportunity no matter how menial the task may seem balance your studies and your work responsibilities as a graduate assistant you are both a student and an employee at the university and it s important that you dedicate enough time and energy to both roles be careful not to neglect your studies for your job or vice versa 6 x research source if you feel that you are not able to keep up with the demands of your classes due to a busy work schedule talk to your supervisor about it you may be able to work out an arrangement that will be more favorable to your class schedule unless you are told otherwise you should not be working on class assignments during work hours instead you should be using this time to contribute to the department s goals to the best of your abilities make the most of your relationship with your mentor you will have a lot of control over the relationship that you have with your mentor you can choose to forge a strong relationship with him or her and get as much input as you can or you can choose to keep to yourself it s in your best interest to take advantage of all the time you have to work with your mentor 7 x research source you re much more likely to be given rewarding work to do if your mentor comes to see you as a valuable employee so work hard to make a good impression keep in mind that your mentor may be able to help you after you graduate by writing you a recommendation letter or putting you in contact with other industry professionals the better your relationship the more helpful he or she will be to you value and respond to feedback it can be hard to get negative feedback on work that you ve done but try not to get defensive about it if your mentor or another colleague lets you know that you could have done something better listen carefully to what they have to say and implement their suggestions in your future work if the feedback is not constructive consider asking how you can improve your work remember that you are here to learn so you should not expect yourself to be perfect do your best and always look for ways in which you can improve your work always take responsibility for your own mistakes instead of trying to blame them on someone else or make excuses for them talk to your boss about expectations and conflicts you will have a much easier time succeeding as a graduate assistant if you communicate well with your boss both when there is a problem and when there is not open the channels of communication early on and keep them open throughout your graduate assistantship whenever you start working on something new try to sit down with your boss and

how to be a good teacher,teaching is one of the most important professions in today s society as a teacher you will shape the minds of others and encourage them to think independently to become a good teacher it s important to be organized create lesson plans objectives activities and assessment plans well before each class day get your students interested in learning by fostering a positive supportive yet challenging classroom environment seek out other teachers for assistance too,create a daily objective for your students this is your way of providing a roadmap for your students it shows them that you ve put thought into the day s work and you know where it is heading it s best if the objectives are clear brief and realistic as each objective is completed remind your students of what they ve accomplished together 1 x research source for example in a high school literature class an objective might be to complete a close reading of a particular poem by the end of the period some teachers find it helpful to post that day s objectives on the board it s okay if not every objective is met every day in some cases it s better to follow the flow of a particular conversation instead of railroading back to the original subject matter listen to your students ask them open ended questions after they ve made a statement encourage them to ask you questions as well show that you are listening to them by nodding your head or gesturing for them to continue give them eye contact while they are speaking and try your best not to interrupt unless you must redirect the conversation 2 x research source being an active listener shows your students that you respect their voice in the classroom they will be more likely to give you respect as a teacher in return it s also a good idea to model for your students how to respectfully listen to someone while disagreeing with them you might say i m not sure i agree with what you are saying can you tell me more or does anyone else want to jump in keep students on task set time limits for classroom exercises or activities in discussions use your responses to their remarks as a classroom management tool for example you might say i really like what you are saying how do you think it connects with objective number five 3 x research source push your students to succeed try to create an environment in which your students will be constantly intellectually challenged let them know that it is okay to fail on occasion you want to strike a balance between setting too high of goals for them and being a push over use your students progress to guide your way they should be steadily improving but not without considerable effort 4 x research source for example you might give a short advanced level reading assignment to high school students and ask them to use a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words if used sparingly this is a great way to challenge students to expand their vocabulary discipline in a prompt and thoughtful way make the rules for your classroom and each exercise very clear and consistent if a student breaks a rule handle it immediately in the classroom before moving forward however once you ve made a disciplinary action don t dwell on it or you could create additional problems also make sure that any consequences that you assign match the level of the offense committed 5 x trustworthy source association for supervision and curriculum development nonprofit organization providing innovative effective educational resources for educators designed to support student achievement go to source for example if a student accidentally disrupts a designated quiet period this can generally be corrected with a simple verbal warning for a first offense you can also ask the student to stay after class and speak with you this is one way to issue a consequence without disrupting your classroom assign leadership roles to difficult students some students create problems in a classroom due to sheer boredom or feeling disconnected with the subject or their teacher start with giving a challenging student small personal tasks to complete then over time give them more difficult and public responsibilities 6 x trustworthy source association for supervision and curriculum development nonprofit organization providing innovative effective educational resources for educators designed to support student achievement go to source for example you might ask a student to serve as a time keeper for an in class exercise be aware that this is an option that won t work for every challenging student if they don t do well at the simple tasks don t give them more advanced ones express a personal interest in all students if you show your students that you enjoy their company and value their opinions then they are far less likely to exhibit challenging classroom behaviors make a point of asking your students about their daily lives and personal interests while staying professional tell your students information about you in return for example you might talk with your students about where they are going for an upcoming break stay calm when addressing argumentative students it s really easy to lose your cool when faced with a challenging or critical student instead take a deep breath and try to look at their perspective ask them to explain their position in further detail encourage other students to enter into the discussion 7 x research source give quiet students many avenues of participation there are many possible reasons why a student might remain silent in your classroom encourage them to learn by creating a safe environment for all opinions offer a variety of assignment options including journal submissions or email logs avoid putting a spotlight on quiet students unless that fits your overall teaching style 8 x research source offer assistance to struggling students do your best to identify students who are struggling academically early on consider offering in class resources such as pair exercises or direct them to external resources such as subject tutoring be a professional at all times dress appropriately for your teaching environment keep your teaching materials and classroom organized spend time preparing for each day of teaching show respect when talking with your colleagues and administrators think about what it means to be a professional teacher and try to live up to that model 9 x research source it sometimes helps to think about one of your past teachers who you would describe as a true professional try to think about how you could in some ways mimic their behaviors in your own classroom and career laugh and keep your sense of humor try to teach your students that learning doesn t have to be serious 24 7 if you do something that is funny or goofy then laugh at yourself being a bit self deprecating will make your students more comfortable with you if you incorporate humor or jokes into your lesson plans then your students will likely remember the material better as well 10 x research source repeat positive mantras on bad days not every teaching day will go perfectly and some might even fall into the category of disaster however it s important to stay positive or your students will pick up and reflect your negative energy take a moment to tell yourself it s going to be okay or tomorrow is a new day put a smile on your face and keep going 11 x research source you might even say out loud i love teaching because and list off a few reasons for example think about a moment when you saw real improvement in a student s life due to your efforts if it s been a bad day for the students too then you might even say that you want to do a re set tell them that you want to formally start the day over from that point forward create good relationships with the parents of students communication is key when working with parents keep in touch with them via in person conferences as well as written behavioral reports let them know that you are interested in their ideas and perspectives on teaching you can also solicit their help for events and celebrations in your classroom 12 x research source make contact with the parent teacher association pta at your school and ask what you can do to help seek out teaching mentors look for other teachers at your school who are willing to discuss teaching with you or who will even let you sit in on their classes if they are interested invite them to your classroom as well after they ve seen you teach ask them to provide you with constructive criticism see if they have suggestions for how you can be an even better teacher for example they might suggest that you state your classroom objectives more clearly then you can talk about how you d go about doing this it s also a good idea to exchange teaching materials with your mentors and colleagues show them the format that you use for quizzes or tests and ask to see their versions you don t have to teach the same subject to benefit from talking about teaching you can also find mentors via teaching organizations or even at conferences stay in touch with the people that you meet and seek out their advice when you need it take time to reflect at the end of each semester or teaching period sit down and evaluate what worked well and what didn t be honest with yourself and realistically assess what is in your power to change before teaching that particular class again if you re preparing for a certain course that always causes problems you might consider reaching out to your mentor for advice 13 x research source for example you might find that your students react better to projects using media if that s the case think about how you can incorporate more media driven activities in your classroom take advantage of professional development opportunities go to teaching conferences in your area and meet other education professionals write articles about teaching and publish them in local magazines or newspapers serve as a grader for exams in your area such as the advanced placements tests keep learning and you ll be a model for your students

just throw up your hands and say that a student s poor grades are because they re lazy or don t care about the material take it as a personal challenge to find ways to engage them in the subject simplify your lessons to focus on the key components good teachers make it easy to understand complicated things use examples models pictures hands on activities real life connections and so on find ways for your students to relate to the material however simple doesn t mean too easy or created without care whittling down complex topics into simpler lessons is a challenge that takes time and effort to master pick the brains of fellow teachers who you respect for their ability to bring focus and simplicity to their teaching keep your students attention through enthusiasm and self awareness you shouldn t expect your students to be excited about learning something if you don t seem excited to be teaching it let your passion shine through in the classroom and some of it will rub off on your students with this enthusiasm explain to your students why the knowledge you convey is important and how they can apply what they learn in their daily lives then they are more likely to remember

a respectful attitude toward students fellow staff members your school your subject and yourself they will pick up on your respectful attitude making it easy to gain their respect use a calm respectful tone when addressing students and staff if you teach multiple classes don t complain about one class to another your students talk to each other so students in the other class will find out take an interest in every child the better you get to know your students the more influence you will have on their attitude towards learning and on their lives in general don t play favorites or deem anyone beyond helping your job as a professional is to teach everyone in the class 17 x research source make sure you don t forget about the students in the middle that is the ones who don t wow you with their successes or frustrate you with their lack of interest remember that your job is to connect with each student as a mentor though you don t need to and shouldn t try to become their friend maintain confidentiality a professional teacher will use students personal information to help them achieve their potential confidential information will not be disclosed as gossip or used as a weapon against a student likewise non classroom information like the content of staff meetings should be treated in the strictest of confidence you could end up in legal trouble or lose your teaching license for disclosing confidential information however also make sure you know when you are mandated by law to disclose confidential information for instance if you are told or suspect that a child is being abused you may be legally required to report this to the authorities 18 x research source consult parents and welcome their involvement include parents in the educational process and encourage their support of the school s disciplinary processes and procedures be polite and calm when dealing with parents remind them that every discussion about the child needs to be undertaken with the child s best interests at heart you can t force parents to get involved in their child s education but you can be as welcoming as possible at the same time be patient with parents who are perhaps too involved and try to nudge them in the right direction support your colleagues and school management show that you re a team player by prioritizing the needs of the institution as a whole remember that you are one person in a group of professionals who should ideally share a common goal and vision 19 x research source there will inevitably be differences of opinion of course and relations between teachers and administrators can get particularly frosty during contract negotiations however don t lose sight of the fact that your focus should be on the well being of the school and its

how to become a montessori teacher,montessori a teaching style developed by the italian physician and teacher dr maria montessori offers a very different experience for both the student and the teacher when compared to a traditional education however like traditional teachers montessori teachers still must become certified to be able to bill themselves as genuine montessori professionals not counting an undergraduate education the training for a montessori teacher can involve a year of study followed by an additional supervised practicum to become fully certified to start down the path to your first montessori job see step 1 below,complete a college education for the greatest range of opportunities for aspiring montessori teachers a college education is a very smart idea though not every single montessori related job will require a college education many states in the u s and many countries outside the u s have this as a requirement for montessori teachers 1 x research source in addition the lack of a college degree may in certain situations qualify you only to become certified only for assistant level positions for these reasons a college degree can greatly expand the range of montessori opportunities available to you luckily montessori teachers in training usually aren t required to have majored in education or a related field in college many successful montessori teachers originally studied in fields as diverse as law engineering or the humanities 2 x research source pick an accredited training center montessori certification training is a serious investment though it will give you valuable skills and credentials it can cost thousands of dollars and require a year or more to complete because of this it s very very important to be sure that the training center you enroll at is fully accredited by a recognized montessori accreditation agency most legitimate training centers will be more than happy to disclose their accreditation status with you if the training center you re thinking of enrolling in lacks the proper credentials do not enroll this can be a huge waste of your time and money luckily association montessori internationale ami the global montessori association has a directory of certified training centers available on its website in addition the montessori foundation has a more extensive list of training locations additionally the american montessori society offers a free online training center locator note that in the united states accreditation from the montessori accreditation council for teacher education macte is generally seen as the definitive sign of a training program s legitimacy 3 x research source choose an area of certification contrary to popular belief montessori isn t just a style of teaching for preschool aged children in fact it s a versatile teaching method that s used for children up to and in rare instances through their teenage years while the foundational principles of montessori teaching are the same for all montessori classrooms the techniques and skills used to teach different ages of children can vary substantially so in general most people who want to become a montessori teacher need to specialize in one or more educational age ranges the most commonly offered areas of certification are 4 x research source infant toddler 0 3 years early childhood 2 5 6 years elementary i 6 9 years elementary ii 9 12 years elementary i ii 6 12 years montessori administration note that some special programs offer skills for teaching children up to age 18 enroll in a training program when you ve located a fully accredited training center near you you ll want to enroll in the next available training session the precise start and end dates of your training period will vary based on your training agency for instance some courses run year round while others take place over one two or more summers 5 x research source pick a training schedule that accommodates your goals and needs montessori training programs vary in price but in general you should expect to spend at least several thousand dollars for instance some relatively low cost infant toddler training programs run at about 2 000 in total 6 x research source complete your coursework though training programs can vary in general people training to become montessori teachers attend classroom lectures complete written coursework and practice hands on training the mixture of abstract and practical work offered by most montessori programs is designed to produce a graduate who is comfortable and experienced working in a montessori classroom setting and who understands the principles of montessori teaching well enough to adapt to any situation in general montessori teachers in training should expect to complete approximately 1 200 hours of instruction in total demonstrate an ability to create montessori teaching materials for all subjects participate in approximately 90 hours of classroom observations and supervised teaching complete an on site teaching practicum find a montessori classroom near you congratulations you ve completed your montessori training and you re now fully certified to lead a montessori classroom many montessori teachers get their first job from connections they make during their on site training and practicum however if you don t this is ok except in some cases like for certifications earned through distance learning 7 x research source montessori credentials are transferable marketable skills generally people who have just received their montessori credentials will want to apply for jobs at local schools with open positions for teaching children of the age range s for which they are certified to teach while you can simply contact local schools directly to check for job openings an even easier way to find open positions is to use an online montessori job finder for instance the american montessori society s online job search utility allows you to quickly find montessori openings in your local area apply for multiple positions as you would do when searching for any other job you ll generally want to apply for multiple positions when you re looking to become a montessori teacher in some situations you may be in competition with other montessori teachers for the opening and since you ve presumably just become certified you may have less teaching experience than some of the other candidates so applying to a range of positions gives you the best possible chance of eventually getting a job note that in the u s public schools generally pay their teachers higher salaries than private schools 8 x research source however for some teachers private schools offer a freer easier teaching environment with none of the bureaucracy of the public school system demonstrate your commitment to montessori values as with most other jobs prospective montessori teachers generally go through an interview vetting process before being hired you may be required to provide a resume proof of your certification and or personal references for these the teachers with whom you completed your practicum are great choices as you re being considered for the job you ll want to show your potential employer that you fully understand the principles of montessori teaching and that you re able to put them in to action in a classroom setting below are just a few things you may want to be prepared to talk about 9 x research source the main principles of montessori education see section below your plan for organizing your classroom and coursework unique teaching materials and opportunities you developed during your practicum instances when you worked to help a slow learning child progress during your practicum your commitment to your students the public and your profession a teacher s three main commitments in the montessori code of ethics 10 x research source be negotiable in terms of your job opportunities as a first time teacher it s a possibility that you won t get your ideal teaching position immediately this is ok like any other job the profession of teaching values experience and seniority as you teach in positions that may not necessarily be ideal to you you ll gain valuable skills and experience that in addition to making you a better teacher will also make you a more attractive job candidate in the future stick with it when it comes to getting your preferred jobs more experience is always a good thing give your children freedom unlike traditional classrooms montessori classrooms are largely student led in other words students have a great deal of freedom in choosing when and how they complete their assignments and in some cases even which assignments they complete this principle is fundamental to the montessori style of teaching children who lead their own educational experience learn independence and are more motivated to learn because of the freedoms they re given for instance in montessori classroom it s not uncommon for the teacher to act as a guide rather than an instructor she guides the children to their hands on activities and sits down and helps them if needed but she allows them to interact freely with their environment she doesn t force them to sit in rows of desks and complete assignments according to rigid rules allow your children to learn by doing montessori classrooms are much more hands on than traditional classrooms while some montessori coursework may involve writing spelling drawing and other activities that are done at a desk or table with pencil and paper montessori teachers look for opportunities for students to learn by manipulating hands on objects like blocks beads and specially designed montessori teaching materials montessori educators understand that children especially young children don t learn best by sitting and listening to lectures they learn by teaching themselves and each others as they interact with their environment for example while a traditional classroom may teach the concept of addition by rote math drills montessori classrooms may use hands on materials like abacus style grids of sliding beads to teach the same concept allow free movement in the classroom in montessori classrooms children are largely free to come and go as they please while there may be some periods of quiet organized instruction most of the time children are allowed to move throughout the classroom from activity to activity the classroom is designed to be accessible to the children for instance in a montessori preschool classroom teaching materials will usually be arranged on low open shelves and the chairs tables and work stations will all be appropriately sized for young children give children uninterrupted learning opportunities while montessori teachers are always available to offer their help to children who need them often they make an effort to step back and monitor the children as they learn stepping in only as needed montessori teachers give their students opportunities to interact with their educational materials and each other with a minimum of interruption for hours at a time this approach allows children to learn at their own pace without the interference of a rigidly structured schedule which for many children can present unnecessary barriers to learning for example in a montessori classroom the teacher may instruct her children that by the end of the day they need to complete and turn in three specific educational tasks during the day the teacher will walk through the classroom interacting with the children monitoring their behavior and offering help to those who need it but she won t assign specific time deadlines for them to complete their various tasks encourage mixed age interactions one important hallmark of montessori education is that classrooms can include children of varying ages with this approach the older more experienced children are encouraged to teach the younger ones which benefits both students the young children receive instruction from their peers and the older children demonstrate mastery of the coursework by teaching it themselves in addition children taught in a mixed age environment gradually become more patient and comfortable interacting with others of varying learning ability,Education-and-Communications

how to be a good student teacher,after studying hard and having great enthusiasm for a teaching career it can come as a shock to your system to try your skills as a student teacher it s most likely that you ll find it tiring and at times challenging and it s a new way of seeing the classroom and being a part of it from your own time as a classroom pupil,read all the materials you ve been given about student teaching prior to entering the classroom trying to wing it without plans that you believe in or to catch up on unread portions as you re going won t help you while you re actually in the classroom be open to criticism as a student teacher think that making mistakes is normal so don t make anything of it bear in mind that no one is perfect even experts sometimes get off track when they are distracted just don t give up persist and you will improve with practice 1 x research source do your background research to find out about the school in advance learn its rules and regulations including any dress code information all of this will help you if students test you trying to find out how much or little you re aware of find out what areas are considered out of bounds to students find out where staff hang out and even whether it s possible for you to get a car parking sticker or permit every small thing matters for a smooth experience learn about the school district school boards if relevant parent teacher associations and all acronyms accompanying these things 2 x research source know where forms for student permissions etc and other important documents are located ask if there are any legal issues or restrictions that you need to be aware of if you haven t already been taught these as part of your teacher training search online for resources to help new teachers there are sites with information suited to student and new teachers and you might also be able to find forums to connect with others in your position to share stories and support make only about 5 or 6 set rules the rest are procedures and processes for each activity and situation not rules as such turning in work testing expectations lab phys ed art halls restroom library etc each need simplified procedures quickly instructed or refreshed on that event each time have your basic classroom rules sorted before you stand in front of your class for the first time for example raise hands when you want to communicate respect others be prepared to listen etc you are then able to discuss these with students from the outset talk with the teacher who is responsible for overseeing what you re doing ask what his or her teaching philosophy or expectations are along with learning about the expected teaching program for the duration of your time working with him or her be sure to find out whether you have free reign or restrictions on teaching methods topics and other relevant issues also aim to have a regular meet up time for discussion or asking questions as you work through your student teacher time 3 x research source expect to be nervous when you first enter the classroom it s probable that your head will be filled with all the things you ve been taught about teaching while all of that is important set aside the need for perfection and concentrate on quelling your nerves and fears the students will be expecting you to appear confident relaxed and at ease as such fake it until you make it and approach the entire experience with a positive attitude expecting to find the experience a good one and you re more likely to find this as a result stay natural it s important to be attentive to detail but not expect to be perfect in what you think a teacher should be avoid unnecessary confrontations acknowledge that you re still a student yourself and realize how a student pretending to be a tough teacher must look the students will cut you some slack if you re friendly affable and approachable firm but not rigid don t overdo anything it s important not to produce a caricature of a teacher your real task is to convey information to students with you as the conduit it is not to convince students that you re a model teacher however there is nothing wrong with sharing your passion for teaching with them things to consider include avoid coming across as too scary or too strict you re still a student remember would you have liked it if your teachers had done that to you show the students that you know how they feel and that you re on their wavelength accept the newness of the situation for both of you move around be complimentary as you go and you ll be welcomed and helped by students be a facilitator don t sit in one place kneel or sit but realize that stooping low may put your posterior in someone space and squatting is awkward or humorous walk toward a disturbance flex float say i ll come back in a minute if a student seems frightened or angered by your attention don t act overly bossy just be matter of fact earn respect while you may feel that this contradicts the previous steps it is possible to earn respect without being scary too strict or too chummy with the students do this through a confident demeanor and by conveying that you expect compliance with simple rules or boundaries in addition if something does happen requiring discipline make it clear that you re not beyond reporting poor behavior to those in the chain of command who have authority to deal with it by actually reporting conduct it will only need to happen once for students to understand that you re not a pushover try hard not to sound nervous if you fear this it s more likely to happen make the most of pauses and taking deep breaths to recover your composure before speaking smile be enthusiastic but not over doing it there is no need to rush do not fear being disliked some students will always push boundaries and make it seem they dislike you the reality however is that most students will respond far more respectfully to a student teacher sticking to well defined boundaries than giving in or acting disappointed that you re not liked your are not there to be a buddy respect the students speak respectfully and show support say thanks for your attention or may i show you this or right or good idea also try this critique the work not the student respect earned is respect best returned avoid using your authority as a power trip that causes you to forget that students are people too go back to the roots of why you took up teaching if you feel you re losing any sense of perspective about the students 4 x research source be genuine show real interest in your student s efforts and praise their work when you have the opportunity be organized and be prepared always come to the lesson prepared all professional teachers are expected to be prepared so it would be a mistake if you as a student teacher didn t this is training for your future career make the most of it schedule a timetable for marking and preparing work this is your first chance to experience the intensity involved in teaching in which you need to be present mentally the entire time you re teaching and then find a second wind for marking and preparation this is a fantastic time to develop time management and personal organization skills that will set you in good stead for the rest of your teaching career keep your promises if you tell your students you will have the quizzes special projects or homework checked by next week always do as you ve promised set an example for them to see and respond to otherwise you can t expect them to do what they re supposed to set out to enjoy your student teaching experience being a student teacher can and should be really fun it is a chance to meet new people usually only a few years younger than you earn some money or credits and to find your rhythm use your sense of humor to its best advantage to engage others and to make light of some of the more challenging aspects in that way you re set to enjoy your experience a great deal more mingle with the other teachers be early stay late seek information listen the the staff can be a great source of information support ideas and future contacts do your best to develop good relationships with amiable faculty members 5 x research source make good friends with parents keeping in touch with parents regularly will establish an excellent rapport and it helps to pass on something positive that their child has done now and then if it s permissible after lessons socialize on campus with your students while having a coffee or a chat together do not be personal buddies this will depend on the student s age and type of school you re teaching at it might not be appropriate at the very least attend social functions held for the students during the term such as dances and sports events when mingling with the other teachers you may make good friendships with them don t expect too much too soon also don t judge them or yourself do not be quick to spread rumors or gossip that can come back to you and ruin your relationships with them,Education-and-Communications
how to be a teacher,becoming a successful and wise teacher is more than just getting a degree and getting a position at a specific school there is also more to teaching than just standing up in front of a class and explaining lessons being a lecturer is called teacher centered class and is not very engaging to the less motivated students student centered classes mean that the teacher is a leader or guide and not much time is spent lecturing except when quickly introducing concepts assignments and to clarify concepts in closure preparing the classroom and the lessons takes time and so do keeping records and planning so you need to set up routines and actually teach the procedures that you will require or else you cannot say sam you know what i expect or cheri you know what to do,decorate your classroom put up one wall section that says something like kids at work another wall area should say focus wall that shows what the class is learning and a word wall of vocabulary is good for any new concepts another wall should be about a special topic such as reading spelling social studies or upcoming tests the idea is that all wall spaces can become learning centers instead of just using bulletin boards 1 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source update displays and walls they need to include current subject matter to be effective and interesting these displays are good for enrichment review and for reminders 2 x research source have helpers for the displays and walls hold clubs outside of class or ask the six weeks or quarterly class officers or even room parents to help with the subject walls and bulletin boards consider arranging your students desks into two areas by room halves put about four or six rows and have a walkway for yourself in between the two sections 3 x research source this lends itself to creating teams that inspire motivation your students desks should allow easy viewing of the main presentation area and whiteboard be secure and keep your students and yourself safe in many schools any visitors are required to sign in at the office and have an identification sticker or id tag for security and control including regularly scheduled ones like room parents always be prepared to challenge unknown people as to their purpose for being in the school establish a positive zone post a sign above or by the door which reads positive zone for students teachers and parents doing this creates a refuge from negative feelings both yours and the students and their parents take a positive attitude if you are not having a good day leave those feelings outside the classroom smile and choose the more positive attitude this doesn t mean there is trouble if you re not always positive it simply means that you aim to encourage everyone showing a positive attitude to each other and that you encourage everyone to get along and have a positive experience treat your students with respect students will respond to positive treatment students notice how you treat other students and will react accordingly treat all students with equal respect in turn expect respect back from the students 5 x research source if you re concerned that the students have a difficult time understanding respectful behavior besides showing it yourself it can be helpful to have discussions about respect in class groups it could even serve as a class topic for a term be firm and matter of fact about rules not argumentative occasionally repeating an important phrase or sentence several times is an effective way to make it definite and without arguing being harsh or rude walk toward the source of noise misconduct or toward a particular student but remain clear of the student s personal space back away saying i ll be back in a minute if a student becomes emotional when you confront them at their desk or have the student sit down if you have a problem with one who is out of the student assigned seating unruly students or shy students may object act out or withdraw if embarrassed or stressed by to much or too close attention 6 x research source focus on student achievement above all the purpose of education is to improve the knowledge of your students 7 x trustworthy source association for supervision and curriculum development nonprofit organization providing innovative effective educational resources for educators designed to support student achievement go to source plan activities and lessons that will increase student achievement and plan ways of recognizing even small improvements for each individual student collaborate with other successful teachers you will learn a lot from other teachers on how to deal with students and make your students successful learners spend some time talking to them about how they have dealt with particular situations in class and what sorts of things they do to encourage respect trust and learning 8 x research source be a leader a person to trust and a person to have learning fun with don t compare one student to another except saying how great they all are working this is so great everyone is working or what a fantastic job you ve all done compliment the work not the student say that work was great so quick or your work is very good aw perfect not you are so smart the reason for this is that you focus on the student s effort and therefore don t imply that only smart kids succeed but demonstrate that anyone prepared to put in the effort will succeed 9 x research source never threaten say what you mean do not make idle promises things that you cannot do or wouldn t do don t back down bluff with a stone face as in playing cards when you need to make your point put on your game face namely be serious and mean it or students may actually say act like a teacher joking around may bring silliness out of students use the teacher look this is important because it engenders an air of authority which students look up to look in control but kind smile remain positive minded you may want to act like a coach sometimes cross the arms and strut or act a little bit like a soldier or officer look like you are not amused by misbehavior that may simply encourage it and look like you are not confused or shaken up though you may be upset do not show it but sometimes you may need to calmly explain what is what calmly i know you are teasing you don t mean it misconduct occurs such as the student gets up and starts toward the door instruct stop go sit down obey me the student may turn around and stare at you or just smile or shrug explain follow instructions i can not allow that do as you are instructed if you say something sarcastic cold mean or irritating apologize quickly say i shouldn t have said that i didn t mean it i m sorry take a deep breath 10 x research source don t rage or cry when you feel embarrassed or infuriated observe if your throat tightens or tears well up in your eyes do not wipe your eyes or sniff clear your throat breathe narrow your eyes keep composure relax though you may tremble shake with anger and dread walk walk around the room observing if a students asks are you crying say no don t explain feelings act natural just say no no problem or it s alright it s okay that s you overcoming it get busy walk across the room and back observing with some students a teacher who cries will be crying more and more if the students see that they can trigger such emotions be consistent be persistent be fair wise sometimes you must need to treat everybody the same whether good bad or indifferent fairness two opposite concepts 1 you must treat everybody as individuals differently according to events needs or conversely 2 you must treat them all the same in some matters as the only way to be fair 11 x research source jigsaw an assignment give groups a topic such as a reading assignment each student in a group would 1 tell each other and agree how to split up and 2 read their part find information in their part and answer a question then 3 the group leader or reporter or group members would present their findings to the class 4 for all everyone to listen write down notes or answers and perhaps discuss and give their take on that groups answers 12 x research source make a scavenger hunt so to speak this is where 1 each student individually reads a slip with one of several questions processes or problems 2 each one writes an answer or solution 3 then students mingle to seek missing information and write it down to fill in the blanks on a chart exercise sheet or data gathering sheet read pair and share this involves 1 each one of the students reading separately then 2 they form pairs when instructed to pair and 3 the pairs answer questions or do problems together this may then move to check and compare if that is needed or if there is time 13 x research source check and compare this is to 1 form groups of two students and work together as pairs to do their part of the assignment and then 2 join with a second pair in a four member group and check and compare the work with each other then 3 they return to their usual seating place interview rotate and discuss 1 form an inner circle and an outer circle of students and interview each other as a pair then 2 rotate and fill in blanks or boxes on an answer sheet or chart with information from each student s point of view about the topic to be discussed repeat the interview and rotate once or twice 3 discuss the questions and answers to bring out and put together variations of different interpretations if any make multiple representations each group of students is given a math problem for which they are to make a poster with 1 a drawing diagram sketch or a chart of the situation in the problem 2 make a relation function or math expression 3 make a graph 4 write a verbal explanation paragraph and then the reporter gives a quick presentation to the class and reads their paragraph play motivational nerf basketball for academics get a four inch 10cm soft foam plastic rubber nerf basketball and use a trash can sitting on a chair or table as the basket or use a plastic breakaway hoops rim in the front of the class divide the class into two teams and tape places on the floor or on the wall where the basketball hoop is located for point values for scoring from behind the marks or below the marks low shots lying squatting or sitting on the floor score a hoop from longer distances for more points from about the opposite end of the classroom for the 6 pointer a 3 pointer goes closer 2 is closer and any similar point system for low shots below the marks play a rewards game similar to basketball this game may help by offering reward points for attendance play basketball shots for 1 good behavior conduct 2 attendance or 3 academics for making a score on classwork test or quiz or a reward for catching up on classwork and improving ones own grades or as a team where a team member would earn and receive a shot for their team to make points by shooting the nerf ball shooters could choose from five positions worth 1 5 points from different difficulties of questions answered correctly to then shoot from the correspondingly difficult position if the answer is correct lining up for shots in front of the class may make for some thrillingly moments for the student and class decide why and how to allow students on each teams to earn the opportunity to play the game this will be determined by your own rules but in any case only how and when you decide to allow playing a team gets a shot for doing an objective or behavior very well if a member of the other team doesn t follow class rules then give the other team a shot or as a variation give five free points without shooting if that works better for test days or other quiet times play friday shots quiz game for academics consider a variation of the nerf basketball for such things as a verbal quiz quiz show members of the two teams compete for points that are earned in a number of ways make it so that the points enable each student to buy something such as a piece of candy an item of stationery or other things you know your students would appreciate points may be used for receiving grand raffle tickets to be drawn after school is out that year for improving by the end of the school year and the prizes are mailed out the nerf games can be a year long team type of competition the winning team may be announced after school is out at the end of the year consider class offices for each team have offices such as a scorekeeper and assistant coach and a captain and co captain with each one serving for a certain time to help you with certain things in elementary classes call the captains president and vice president you the teacher are the head coach offices could be rotated among the students who display better conduct teams are good for motivation and control since you can when one team is noisy give another team turns to make points and they ll all learn to be quiet if your class walks noisily to recess or anywhere you might consider letting them out one to three minutes later than they re supposed to be at the end of the day or if they re good let them out a minute early enforce school rules of the entire building and school grounds and explain that you will follow the school and district rules rules such as no cell phones on during class keep your hands to yourself say only kind things do as your teacher says be on time what to do if you miss a day of school lawful activities etc set your class rules perhaps five or six at the most but these are not the situational procedures you will need several differing procedures that the students must know or that you must explain at the time of necessity an effective way to decide rules is to let your classes help decide reasonable rules and consequences and this way your class should follow and help you to enforce them because they have bought into the ownership of them they can also decide for some fun things like the point values and reasons for shooting at various distances for the ball game etc see above be strict and you decide how and when to allow any game or whatever else may be needed by the same token be moderate and let a student occasionally have an oops for example give them each a credit call it an oops card when students are good for a certain length of time then they can trade their oops card which allows them to miss one night s homework or for some other reward teach how you manage the class use some non verbal signals or prompts to establish order for example perhaps when you raise your hand in a certain way to get class attention similar to the way they must get your attention by raising a hand or instead you start clapping a certain way clap clap clap clap clap clap clap and they can join the clapping for a quick funny motivator keep it short this is better than shouting stamping feet or slapping on a wall or table can get students to smile and enjoy class especially for harder subjects some teachers use a noise like an instrument perhaps a recorder or running a stick over a wooden animal to make a croaking sound you can some up with many different ideas for noise makers and visiting a local trade aid shop can provide many handcrafted options for little cost teach the students your classroom procedures the way you need them to be observed this is quite different from the few set rules develop as many procedures as are needed according to and as you have different situations classwork testing procedures work turn in homework grades hallway procedures etc smooth operations you tell them what to do when entering class and to begin the class you must reserve the right to say when the class ends not the bell in any case bells may ring at the wrong time and for varying reasons and you may not have finished class when the bell rings general orders putting away and getting out supplies and books pencil sharpening cleaning up throwing away trash on the whiteboard list topics of what they need to do another trick for the worksheets is to have team officers who can give out and take up and file individual folders or packets daily or for a change of activity know the school wide procedures fire drill procedures versus storm warning storm watch earthquake drills etc get the bell schedules for different kinds of days and keep them available such as half days assembly and pep rally days etc 14 x research source balance your subjects every week have a math day and language arts day every other week have a science day and history day this way you ll be sure that your students have tons of things in mind keep all subjects on track don t be the teacher who hardly ever gets around to science or math because you only have time for reading spelling compositions and handwriting you ll be in trouble and very unhappy when your students do not make adequate progress or may even regress in those technical courses have a class bank in the elementary class during the beginning of every trimester or semester have your student s parents each donate five dollars or ten dollars this way for parties or anything there is no need for parents to donate repeatedly plan to have no free periods no free days or parties unless the entire school is having a festival day homecoming or other such observance talk to the other teachers to get a feel for what goes on at your school many school systems will no longer allow homemade foods or snacks to be sold or given to students because they may be unsafe unsanitary find out how your school operates some teachers do ignore food rules and such but the rules are there to protect the school system and you against lawsuits and bad publicity as opposed to a food incident that could be devastating to student health and safety have a room mom or dad in elementary school they will volunteer a week or some other period of time and will help students that need help or can observe students doing an assignment in one area of the room while you work with a group on another routine or procedure avoid messy and dangerous surprises keep all supplies put away and locked up if possible things like paints glue art paper stapler paperclips tape and such or some student s will surprise you and get them out to make something or do something dangerous wasteful or messy mischief may be rare but it is very problematic when it does happen especially when you have your mind and eye occupied elsewhere this of course is an area for a strict rule to be set have things like tissues and wipes on hand for sneezes messes and other such things if you are a high school teacher have spare sanitary ware on hand for students in need,Education-and-Communications
how to be a good teaching assistant,there are many different types of teaching assistant positions ranging from kindergarten assistants to high school special education assistants to college tas your responsibilities as a teaching assistant will vary depending on where you are working but there are a few key elements to becoming a valuable assistant in any learning environment,listen to the teacher s needs your number one job for this position is to assist the teacher chances are your job exists because the teacher already has an idea of what she wants or needs out of an assistant before starting the position or during your first few days take notes on what is expected from you determine early on what your primary responsibilities will be for the position will you mainly be helping a few students who need special support will you be working behind the scenes making photocopies and grading papers or will you be taking over entire classes for the teacher if you have questions about anything the teacher describes ask earlier rather than later 1 x research source familiarize yourself with the curriculum you ll be able to best assist the students if you know what they are learning as well as when and how they are learning it just because you have already taken the class that you ll be assisting with doesn t mean you automatically know all about it from a teacher s perspective read the teacher s lesson plans curriculum books syllabus etc 2 x research source offer to check for homework and grade papers part of the responsibilities of a teacher are the day to day monitoring of student progress you can be a huge help to the teacher by sharing in these responsibilities make a tracking sheet with each students name with columns of boxes so you can check off who brings their homework on time after grading papers offer to enter the grades into the computer grading system for the teacher or keep a paper record of the grades on paper to give to them to enter 3 x research source ask if you can help communicate with parents some public districts may have rules about who can communicate with parents but if you are authorized to make parent phone calls it can be a huge help to the teacher be sure to keep calls professional if you are dealing with behavior problems from the student be sure to include highlights of things the child does well along with your reports of the problem behavior no parent wants to hear only negative things about their child giving only negative reports will decrease the amount of support and cooperation you get from the parent 4 x research source offer to run errands for the teacher something that can be very helpful for a teacher is to run to the copy machine or to the office during class an adult needs to remain with the students at all times so if the teacher realizes she didn t make enough copies for that day s lesson after class has already started it can be quite stressful you can help in this situation by going out and making the needed amount of copies for her ask to help with the schedule calendar teachers often have a calendar posted in the classroom that outlines important student dates and events for that month you can assist in the sometimes monotonous task of filling in that calendar by offering to complete it for her you ll need to have a grasp on school events and regular classroom procedures before being able to do this 5 x research source offer to watch students while the teacher steps out bathroom emergencies and last minute meetings can happen for teachers the school district where you work may have rules about who may stay with students for an extended period of time but most will allow for a teaching assistant to stay with students for 10 minutes or less make the teacher aware that you are available as needed for this responsibility 6 x research source ask if you can help with special discipline cases sometimes students may have a particular issue going on that requires them to spend extra time out of class or in the office some students may not be allowed to walk the halls during class without adult supervision other times a student s iep individualized education plan requires that they have occasional breaks from the room ask the teacher if you can be of assistance by remaining with these students and walking with them where they need to go while she is teaching get to know the students a primary responsibility of any teacher is getting to know the students and developing an understanding of their learning strengths and needs make an effort to learn all of your students names within the first couple of weeks if you have trouble remembering names you can make flash cards with defining student features another good trick for remembering names is to use popsicle sticks for class discussions write each student s name on a stick and pull them randomly during discussions the student who answers is the one whose name matches your stick keep a journal with reflections from each day this will help you determine strengths and needs of certain students as well as which lessons went well or didn t and why 7 x research source keep the room tidy no teacher or student likes a messy learning environment between classes be sure to push chairs back in straighten desks pick up dropped papers or pencils and organize materials ask the lead teacher before doing any major reorganizations in the room many teachers are particular about where they like having things placed 8 x research source take instructional tips from the teacher because your role as an assistant provides you with many opportunities for dialogue with students you should practice how to provide assistance without actually completing work for the students learn how to answer a question with a question if a student needs help doing a particular task ask what they remember about what they learned to guide them through getting their answer students remember more by figuring out tasks for themselves not by being spoon fed every step of the way 9 x research source make bulletin boards and displays of student work most students love to see their work displayed publicly this is also a chance for you to get creative your school should have a main supply room where you can find colored paper and bulletin board borders gather supplies and get to work decorating let students know which projects you intend to hang up for display 10 x research source assist with supervision during field trips when your class makes outings there is a need for as many adults as possible to assist with keeping a head count of students and helping with various tasks like passing out snacks or lunches and keeping everyone quiet during guest lectures you can also help students get interested in the field trip by talking about your own experiences if any in visiting the place where you re going 11 x research source take younger students to lunch specials classes teachers can often use all the extra time during the day that they can get for planning lessons and grading papers if you can cut down on the teacher s need to leave class by walking students to where they need to go she will probably be very appreciative proctor make up tests for older students teacher s lives are often full of giving tests in order to keep up with district and state requirements sometimes when students are absent on testing days it makes it complicated for teachers to find the time to give a make up exam offer to take students out of the room to the library or other quiet area to give them the make up test it can be extremely helpful to both teachers and students alike determine which students need extra support some teaching assistants are hired specifically to help certain students in these cases you will find out immediately which students are yours to assist in other cases such as assistants for whole classes it will be up to you to figure out which students could benefit most from your extra help during lessons watch for students responses and levels of participation the ones who aren t participating as much or who look confused are ones who could benefit from some extra one on one assistance ask to look through student records again some records may be confidential according to the district but you can ask what you re allowed to look through in order to gain extra insight into the needs of specific students for students who do need extra support or to whom you are assigned to in the class be sure to provide support without hovering over the student a student with extra special needs may become clingy to an assistant in these cases be sure show your affection toward the student while also encouraging them to join peer groups and develop friendships 12 x research source offer to hold review sessions for struggling students students who are falling behind on certain concepts in class can often use some extra time with the material when the rest of the class is ready to move onto the next unit offer to spend time reviewing the old material with the students who need extra help you should be able to find extra practice work in the room by asking the teacher 13 x research source maintain professionalism remember that you are an authority figure to students yet you do not make final decisions regarding classroom procedures remembering this balance in your role will help you to create a smooth classroom environment if questions arise by students regarding rules and you are unsure of the answer it is okay to say let s check with the teacher first at the same time if students do not listen to you because you re not the real teacher it is okay to remind them that you are an adult in the class and you should be treated with respect just as any adult should be treated always be a model example for students do not participate in side conversations with students while the teacher is talking and maintain your composure if a student is creating disruption don t lose your temper or become emotional with either students or the teacher 14 x research source,Education-and-Communications
how to be a successful teacher,teaching at any level is a challenging occupation students can be demanding the grading often feels endless and talking in front of a room full of people gives many

rewarding job you can become a successful teacher at any pedagogical level by preparing ahead of time successfully managing your classroom and engaging directly with students,do your class preparation and lesson planning well in advance for teachers few experiences are less enjoyable than staying up late the night before a class preparing the readings or assignments that your students will complete the next day keep your work organized and plan each lesson ahead of time 1 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source it helps to have written lesson plans at the beginning of each week write down your lesson plan for each class you will teach do your class preparation writing assignments and quizzes preparing videos etc at the beginning of the week as well monthly calendars are often helpful for a big picture approach preparing a detailed calendar a month or two in advance will help you schedule the various segments of the course you re teaching if you re teaching at the high school or college level consider sharing the calendar with your students even if the calendar will change slightly as the course develops establish a regular schedule for your grading many inexperienced teachers find themselves quickly bogged down in grading seemingly endless papers and tests to avoid this figure out when during the week you have time to grade and break the total amount of weekly grading down into manageable pieces 2 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source it helps to use a timer when grading for example give yourself 15 minutes to grade each essay and 5 minutes to grade each quiz use technology that will be helpful to your students while you do not need to always use the newest most trendy teaching technique or teach from your students favorite website it will help both you and your students if you use some technology in the classroom 3 x research source students quickly become tired of repetitive class structures and lectures using technology could mean create a powerpoint or prezi to convey information show your students a short relevant film or video that will spark classroom discussion there are even phone based learning apps that instructors can incorporate into new lessons vary your teaching style and strategy this will allow you to accommodate different learning styles although you as a teacher may have a favorite way of teaching your students consider that various students may learn better through other methods including verbal instruction reading texts conversation and hands on experience experiment with different teaching techniques skip the lecture and instead help your students learn with an active group activity bring in tangible objects related to the lesson that your students can interact with and learn from in discussions provide a mixture of abstract thoughts and practical examples take your students on a field trip even in college let teaching inspire your own learning part of the pleasure of teaching students is that along with sparking their curiosity to learn you can remind yourself of the pleasure of learning as well you can allow your teaching to maintain your own academic and personal interests in the subject matter of your classes 4 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source if you re permitted make small changes to your teaching materials and assignments each year this will keep the material fresh for you and make it more enjoyable for your students decide on your classroom policies then follow through it s important to show your students that there are specific guidelines that they need to follow in your classroom clearly state these policies on your syllabus and expect your students to follow the policies for example consider will you allow students to use their cell phones while in class can students take notes on a laptop computer or tablet how many times can a student arrive late before they lose points although some of these may be school wide policies that you have no control over you should still enforce and follow through on them maintain your authority over the classroom while teachers should not be seen as authoritarian it s important that you do act with authority show that you are effectively leading the class by explaining the daily class schedule ahead of time and keeping the class focused on the lesson be clear that when you are speaking all student conversation needs to stop don t hesitate to call out individual students say something like please don t speak over me and raise your hand if you have a question politely but firmly insist that students put away their phones and computers as well if your students are browsing the internet rather than taking notes dress like a professional the way you dress and act plays a large roll in how you are seen by your students both men and women especially teachers in their 20s should dress professionally wear a jacket a shirt and tie wear a dress or skirt to look more professional and consequently more authoritative plan out how the class will spend its time every period this should be a standard part of your lesson planning it s better to plan too many activities for any given class period than too few if you have an extra activity save it for a day when you get through your lesson more quickly than anticipated aim for each activity to take about 25 minutes this will give you a rough estimate of how many activities you can plan in a class period if you have a 50 minute class period plan on two major activities have your students complete a quiz and then participate in a group discussion or for younger students ask them to complete a hands on activity in a group then individually write a summary of what they learned don t plan to improvise or change plans in the middle of class act confidently even if you don t always feel confident one of the most challenging parts of teaching especially for new teachers is showing confidence in front of a classroom full of strangers even if you don t feel confident at first fake it students usually can t tell the difference and your classroom successes will turn into genuine confidence soon enough use occasional humor in the classroom humor can often show confidence it makes you look like you are in control of a situation if you can inject occasional humor 5 x research source show confidence by your physical presence don t huddle in a corner of the classroom during every class period stand up move around gesture with your arms and write on the whiteboard these motions will make you appear confident and dynamic give your students plentiful and constructive feedback students enjoy and expect feedback from their teachers it shows that you are personally evaluating their work and that you have firm standards in place 6 x research source when grading a student s essay try leaving four or five comments on the body of the essay and then a three to four sentence paragraph at the end where you detail the major successes and failures of the essay give your students verbal feedback in class encourage their comments and gently push them to develop more complex ideas and solutions engage personally with your students during in class discussions 7 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source this will communicate your respect and consideration for the individual student your student will in turn have a greater respect for you if it s clear that you know his or her name and care about his or her education treat students with kindness showing your students respect and kindness should be a guiding principle when you engage with your students this is true in all settings in which you communicate with students in the classroom in your office hours over email or in any other manner listen when they speak and do not speak over a student give your students the benefit of the doubt it can be easy for teachers to forget that their students have a life outside of the class required homework however you need to remember that many students have busy schedules and complicated personal lives if students claim to have had a health problem or family emergency evaluate their claim with objectivity encourage your students many students see their teachers primarily as disciplinarians they view a teacher as someone who punishes them for doing poorly on an assignment or for speaking out of turn in class 8 x research source contrary to this through your own enthusiasm for the class topic and the materials that you are teaching you should encourage and inspire your students to learn about the class topic praise students individually and collectively for their work find aspects of the class work that each student engages with and encourage the students to develop their own interests within the class establish boundaries for you and your students to follow outside of the classroom many inexperienced teachers plan to befriend their students and to treat them like friends outside the classroom this can lead to encounters that may appear unprofessional and a lack of a formal relationship between you and your students make it clear to students how they can contact you for example give them your email address but avoid handing out your cell phone number be clear with your students about how long it will take for you to reply to their emails will you try to reply within the same hour or within a 24 hour period avoid meeting with students off campus if you must meet at a coffee shop avoid meeting in places that serve alcohol as it could send a misleading message,Education-and-Communications

make it an easier ride,graduate secondary high school you will need to at a minimum have a secondary high school degree in order to get the further education necessary to become a teacher in some countries certain grades from these school years are necessary in other words the better you do the better your chances get experience working with kids most teaching programs won t even consider admitting you if you don t have a reasonable amount of experience working with kids volunteer in a classroom doing big brothers big sisters or get a job at a daycare or other child friendly facility graduate from university you will need to get a higher degree beyond the basic secondary high school degree this should preferably be a degree in education but some countries and states have a bit of a leeway on that find out the requirements for your area again the better your grades the better your chances 1 x research source get teacher certification there are usually a series of tests you will need to complete in addition to your degree which will allow you to become a teacher complete these tests and anything else necessary to get your certification 2 x research source complete other

background check and fingerprinting all necessary requirements will be made clear to you upon completion of your certification teach at a public school this is the basic state funded school where the majority of students will be found this requires the most amount of effort and training but tends to lead to more secure employment and benefits 3 x research source teach at an at risk school at risk schools are low income schools where the students are at risk of falling into a life of drugs or crime never finishing school and generally going on to very hard lives often times these schools have students who are second language learners ells teaching at schools like these can be more rewarding but is also more challenging and dangerous if you go on to teach at schools like these there is the possibility of your student debt being forgiven many programs like these are in place across the world 4 x research source teach at a private school private schools are those run by companies or

how to be the best fourth grade teacher,teaching 4th grade can be a very intimidating task it is the year that most students begin standardized testing to gauge the school s effectiveness it is one of the last years before students enter middle school here are some tips to help 4th grade teachers engage with their students and maximize their effectiveness at this crucial time in a child s education,engage in conversations with students try to avoid lecturing to your students they often have short attention spans and need a little help to remain in the present teaching moment encourage their input when you are teaching this will help them participate more in their own education and will make them more confident about speaking up in class try to participate in conversations with your students even when you are not specifically teaching them allowing students to get to know you and showing them that you want to get to know them too makes them feel more comfortable in your class ask questions try to make your students think as much as possible ask them questions about their life ask them questions about the world around them ask them questions about the things you read in class the more questions you ask the more they ll be forced to think about the topic and come up with their own answers be flexible different students learn in different ways it s important to acknowledge this and to allow for a certain amount of flexibility in your daily schedule if students are clearly interested in a certain topic spend a little more time on it than you had initially planned if an activity you planned isn t going over well switch to something else always try to choose the option that keeps the students as engaged as possible unplanned active learning is better than forcing students into an activity that isn t holding their interest display student work students will be more engaged on a daily basis if they feel valued and rewarded make it a point to prominently display some of their artwork or other projects in your classroom so that they know you value what they do 1 x research source this will help them feel proud of their accomplishments and want to continue the level of work that helped them get there consider special strategies for teaching various subjects each subject is different and requires different methods of teaching the longer you teach 4th grade the more you ll figure out what works for you but here are a couple of tips dealing with various subjects english 4th grade english involves a lot of vocabulary and spelling practice in addition to reading and writing one of the best ways to help improve students vocabulary and spelling is through good old fashioned worksheets and spelling tests include educational games like role plays crossword jumbled words and other games to make the students happy and enthused to participate 2 x research source social studies a lot of what is learned in 4th grade social studies classes has to do with historical events dates people and places these topics can be hard to remember so sometimes it can be helpful to show interesting educational videos that help students put a face with the name science science should be hands on whenever possible to help students learn make students create a science project make them draw out the phases of mitosis or make them do anything else that gets them involved in the process use games as a means of learning everyone gets bored eventually during lecture style learning moments and elementary school children have a much shorter attention span than most older students so this is not an effective teaching method to employ with 4th graders try employing games in your classroom to boost students energy levels and to improve their active involvement in the learning process there are many examples of educational games that you can find on the internet find some that you think your students will be interested in and adapt them to your particular topic subject if necessary as you use the games in class you ll figure out what works and what doesn t then you can adjust the activities for the next time so that they are better suited for your specific teaching style and subject matter here are some helpful websites that have in class games appropriate for 4th grade students www learninggamesforkids com 3 x research source www funbrain com 4 x research source www abcya com 5 x research source www knowledgeadventure com 6 x research source www education com 7 x research source www vocabulary co il 8 x research source www jumpstart com 9 x research source use rewards as incentives unfortunately many 4th grade students have yet to discover the joy of learning for learning s sake try implementing a system of rewards that will motivate your students to stay on task and to complete projects satisfactorily note try to provide incentives for input activities things that students put time into like reading and homework rather than on output results like grades and scores 10 x research source this will be more effective because students can control how much time they spend on activities but they may struggle more with achieving certain grade levels so if you assign incentives based on something students feel is largely out of their control like what grade they get on a project or assignment they may become flustered with the incentive program and give up trying to achieve the incentives altogether do a show and tell activity with your students most 4th grade students learn best by having hands on experience within the learning process ask your students to bring in an object they have in their house that relates to the topic you are currently studying this will make them think about the subject matter and apply it to their own life in order to find a suitable item to bring to class for example if you re discussing native american history try to find an authentic arrowhead and show it to your class then ask your students to bring something from their own house that is related to native american history in some way they could bring a leather vest a beaded purse a toy horse a picture of a hunting bow or any other object related to the topic be direct make sure that you provide clear direct instructions when you are assigning a certain task to students don t assume that they ll read between the lines or infer something that you don t explicitly state tell them exactly what you want them to do and how you expect them to do it show examples students can have many different learning styles some are visual learners while others learn by doing whatever the case you will have a variety of learning styles in your classroom and it is important to cater to them all one of the easiest ways to do this is by showing examples to help your students practice whatever skill is being taught teaching them the skill then showing them how to implement it is an effective way to make the skill stick for example if you are teaching your 4th grade students about multiplying fractions it is important to teach them the problem solving method and then go over multiple examples with them you can do this through worksheets in addition to problems on the board so that they have several ways to practice and learn the skill go over the directions twice sometimes kids don t understand the directions the first time around and realistically it s always possible that kids will become distracted and missed what you said the first time altogether so make sure they are paying attention and repeat the directions a second time allow your students time to ask questions after giving your instructions make sure that you provide enough time for your students to ask questions that way if something is unclear to them they have time to ask for clarification go to the library the library is a great place to help students develop an interest in reading and learning allow them several trips to the library every week so that they can pick out their books return old books and just spend some time reading provide ample in class reading time let students have class time to just sit and read their books you can decide if they have to read books just from the library or if they can bring books from home to read during this time but the most important thing is to get students interested in reading and to give them time to do it in class this will show them that reading is an important skill and will help them to develop stronger reading abilities over time read a book as a class reading a book as a class can be a fun experience that everyone looks forward to each day the students can discuss the book with each other since they are all reading the same book at the same time this will also help improve their listening comprehension skills because they are practicing listening to something that is fun and doesn t feel like work to them but will still build these listening skills so they can apply it to their schoolwork make students practice studies have shown that children learn to read and write by reading and writing 11 x research source so it is essential to give them time to practice these crucial skills in class and encourage them to reinforce these skills with homework and reading assignments make a schedule and stick to it students thrive when they are given routines to follow knowing what they will do each day at a certain time allows them a sense of stability that helps them to feel more comfortable in your classroom consider pacing and stamina 12 x trustworthy source association for supervision and curriculum development nonprofit organization providing innovative effective educational resources for educators designed to support student achievement go to source it is important to think about how long students can sit still how long students should go between snacks how long certain activities should take etc planning too much of one activity can mean drastically decreased productivity it is often helpful to schedule a short snack break or recess to break up longer periods of required concentration if you keep these things in mind you ll be better prepared to structure effective lessons that work to balance active participation with periods of sitting and listening schedule time for movement students need to be able to move around throughout the day getting their blood circulating with active movement can greatly increase their ability to concentrate and to stay energized as they work try building movement into your lessons for example structure your math lesson so that students must move from table to table to solve the problems 13 x trustworthy source association for supervision and curriculum development

include classes in electromagnetic theory optics quantum physics and thermodynamics and may also include classes in astronomy and geology 7 x research source typically your education coursework will include classes in general education theory and practical courses in teaching physics concluding with either a single semester or 2 semesters of student teaching during your senior year most bachelor s degree programs take about 4 years to complete some programs are structured so that you take your physics classes first and then your education classes while others are structured so you take your physics and education classes at the same time college classes in either technical writing or scientific writing may also be helpful to build on the english classes you took in high school consider getting your master s degree if you plan to teach physics at the community college level you ll need to get a master s degree before you can obtain a teaching position if you plan to teach at the middle or high school level initially you probably won t have to get your master s degree at first however many districts do provide incentives for teachers to get their master s degrees and some states require teachers to hold master s degrees either at the start of their teaching careers or after several years most master s programs can be completed in 2 years and usually are oriented toward more independent study than undergraduate programs 8 x research source some universities will also accept master s degree holders as professors of physics on a part time or adjunct basis check the board of education website for the state or district in which you plan to teach to see whether and when you need to acquire your master s degree to be a physics teacher obtain a phd if desired this step is likely required if you re seeking a full time position as a physics professor at a college or university that leads to tenure phd programs last for several years during which time you ll combine teaching as a graduate assistant with independent study and research 9 x research source you will need strong research skills to become a professor at a university as nearly all universities require their professors to publish their scientific findings on a regular basis you may be able to teach at a university without a phd but your contract will likely be limited when it comes to opportunities for advancement if you have a phd you can also teach at lower levels if you wish for example you may be a top candidate for positions at private or independent high schools ask about alternative certification programs in some states if you already have a bachelor s degree but not specifically in education or science you may be able to undertake a certification program that will allow you to teach however this varies widely by state so you will need to consult with the board of education in your state to see if this is a possibility 10 x research source beware online certification programs while there are likely some legitimate online certification options chances are that if you simply search google you will come across some scams or other programs which promise certification but do not hold the accreditation necessary to do so if you are interested in online degrees or certification programs be sure to consult with the board of education about what online programs are accredited look into financial aid regardless of what degree you will need to earn there are many options available to help you cover the costs of earning a degree the best way to find out what s available at your university is to visit your financial aid office they will be able to explain to you the process of applying for financial aid and can also give you a list of scholarships that you can consider applying for 11 x research source the robert noyce teacher scholarship program offers lots of scholarship options to aspiring teachers in addition phystec offers a number of scholarships to students of physics many master s and doctoral degree programs offer assistantships or other financial aid to students of their program be sure to look into what each program can offer you some programs require that you apply for the aid so make sure that you include any required information with your application become a tutor one good way to gain experience teaching physics is to offer tutoring 12 x expert source sean alexander ms academic tutor expert interview 14 may 2020 you may have done this already to give yourself an idea about whether or not you will enjoy teaching you

of a more experienced teacher you will be required to plan lessons teach and answer questions in a real world environment look for teaching assistantships if you are a graduate school student there are likely graduate teaching assistantships which will provide you with an opportunity to give lectures to real students not only that but in many cases the professor of the class will give you feedback on your teaching in order to help you improve 14 x research source an added advantage is that graduate assistantships are usually paid so you will be able to earn a bit of extra money at the same time if you are still an undergraduate student but know that you would like to teach physics at the college level then see if there are opportunities for undergraduate teaching assistantships consider applying for a job where you completed your student teaching if you completed your student teaching at a school that is in need of more physics teachers then consider submitting an application there you will have the advantage that the people who would be hiring you already have knowledge of you and your teaching ability don t be afraid to talk with the teacher who mentored you

students for the rest of your life 16 x research source remember that you can always change careers while it is certainly not easy if the idea of teaching the same subject for 40 years scares you remember that you can try something new if you really do get tired of teaching if you enjoy talking about physics with others and have a real love for the subject then you will probably make a great physics teacher talk to physics teachers if you are still in high school or college visit the physics teacher tell them that you are thinking of becoming one and ask them to chat with you about the advantages and disadvantages of teaching the subject experienced teachers can give you a good idea about what to expect when it comes to teaching physics however remember that their advice is somewhat subjective try to talk to a few different teachers as you may stumble upon some teachers who have become really bitter about teaching for one reason or another use tutoring to gauge your interest in physics one way to help yourself know whether or not this is something you would enjoy is to tutor if you already have a good knowledge of the field then consider offering free tutoring to those who are struggling although you could charge for your tutoring to earn a bit of extra money if you are more interested in the experience then offering tutoring free of charge will give you a chance to tutor more people you can advertise your tutoring by placing flyers with your name phone number and or email near classrooms where physics is being taught you can also place the flyers around your

how to be the teacher kids love,there are a lot of things that make a great teacher like a good education integrity respecting the kids you teach and more but the true success of a teacher is how you get your students to pay attention and love to learn most of these traits are not the things you learn in university instead they have more to do with your personality and interactions you can learn some great tips to become the teacher kids love,say hello to as many students as possible by name whether it s the morning or the start of class take the opportunity to greet your students as they arrive use their names when saying hello and use the moment to ask about something personal e g how their sports game went how they did on a homework assignment in another class etc if there s time provide your students with individual attention even if you re only able to spare a few short minutes for a student give them your undivided attention during that time have private conversations with your students giving a student one on one attention can go a long way to showing that student you do care about them and their future if you notice something may be wrong with a student take the time to speak to them alone to ask if they re okay the fact that you noticed shows them you care and may give that student the courage to speak up about whatever is wrong be aware of how you approach a student for a one on one conversation many students may automatically assume such a talk is required because they did something wrong approach the student with a smile and start by complimenting them e g nice shirt great question in class today etc and then ask if they have some time for a chat you are also likely to be approached by a student who may want to talk to you in private try to work these requested conversations into your schedule the best you can if you don t have time immediately admit that and tell the student you ll follow up with them very shortly to let them know when you do have time and then of course follow up allow your students to have time to process what they learn not everything is going to come easily to every student sometimes students need to think something over for a while or just sleep on it in order for a topic to make sense give the students who need this the time try not to rush them not everyone learns the same way so you can t teach everyone the same way and expect the same results when you teach something brand new in class there are going to be students who get it right away and students who need some time to grasp the new concept students who need more time to grasp new concepts may feel embarrassed if they re asked a question they cannot answer try to assess which students in your class are quick learners and which students are more thoughtful try not to put students who need time to think about a concept on the spot in the first few classes that you teach a new topic it s also important to avoid rushing through a topic without ensuring the students understand it while you may not be able to go slow enough for the slowest student just like you can t go fast enough for the fastest student you should at least go slow enough for a decent majority of the class you may be able to tell if the class needs more time on a certain topic by asking open ended questions about what parts they think make sense and what parts they think are confusing get them to discuss the topic to see where you may need to expand your lesson speak to the students you know can do better as a teacher you ll probably come across one or more students whom you know can do a better job when you see this don t put them down and shame them because they could do better instead challenge them to do better let them know you believe in them and you know they re capable of so much more encourage them to try harder there could be a number of underlying reasons why a student isn t trying as hard as they can take the time to find out why a specific student isn t performing up to par don t automatically assume they re being lazy when you come across a student like this approach them respectfully in private don t have this discussion in front of the other students tell them your concerns but also tell them that you think they re really smart and could do so much better if they did something specific and provide a very specific action item work with that student by challenging them to perform increasingly complex tasks until they reach a point where they ve gained enough confidence to continue performing at a high level on their own trust your students from the get go instead of having your students earn your trust over time start off the year by giving them 100 of your trust as they progress through the year trust them to do the right thing give them the benefit of the doubt believe your students when they make a promise only start to remove that high level of trust if they let you down but let them know they ve let you down explain your lessons in an easy to understand manner some subjects are complicated but that doesn t mean you have to explain them in a complicated way explain your lessons in such a way as to be easily grasped by students of all levels avoid using big and complicated words that are beyond your students vocabulary 1 x research source sometimes the easiest way to explain something complicated is to break it down into smaller pieces and explain each small piece individually visuals of any kind can make a subject much easier to learn as a student doesn t have to try to guess how something works or what it looks like while you certainly want to expand your students vocabulary as much as possible there are limits if you re using a word found only in a university textbook you re probably getting a little too complicated be patient with your students patience is a virtue and an absolute must as a teacher teachers who get upset easily or yell at students constantly are usually those who students try to avoid depending on their age you may need to use your patience in order not to get upset if your students won t calm down or pay attention but you ll also need to use your patience when explaining concepts and answering questions 2 x research source remember there is no stupid question never put a student down for asking a question no matter what it is if it s an inappropriate question explain to the student and the class why it s inappropriate even if you re getting impatient and frustrated on the inside keep your composure on the outside if you need to vent about something your students did to a fellow teacher or friend later that s fine some students try to get extra attention by acting out in class disrupting your lesson and causing the other students to lose focus while this is annoying keep in mind that there may be something happening to this student personally that is causing this behaviour listen to what your students are saying there is almost nothing worse as a young person than to be disrespected simply because you re a young person age doesn t depict intelligence just the amount of knowledge you already have students can be afraid to ask a question or give an opinion because they aren t sure if an adult will care as a teacher you need to care about every question and opinion your students have 3 x research source again there are no stupid questions if a student asks a question it probably means there s something they don t understand or are confused about use their question as a guide to further explaining whatever was confusing people of all ages have opinions and there are no wrong opinions respect what your students have to say and engage them in a conversation about their opinions without using your more extensive knowledge or experience to put them down help teach your students how to argue and justify an opinion without disrespecting someone who has a different opinion choose to ignore bad behaviour sometimes some semi bad behaviour isn t great but it s also not worth the time to interrupt class to address pick your battles don t be the teacher who stops class for every little misbehaviour 4 x research source focus on addressing bad behaviour that is disrespectful cruel mean or physical when bad behaviour does happen in your classroom use it as a teaching moment for the rest of the class to better understand why that behaviour is inappropriate even if a student is being disrespectful to you with their behaviour you shouldn t be disrespectful to them with your behaviour keep your cool and demonstrate how you re the bigger person consider helping your students with career planning students like it when their teachers spend time on topics that aren t typical to a school classroom like career planning teaching a specific subject is great but how does that subject fit into the grand scheme of the world observe your students and their skills and interests and try to link those to a potential career that might interest them 5 x research source career planning doesn t have to be taken on by you as the teacher alone invite guest speakers to your classroom to help explain a specific career or how one might decide what career they want to pursue make the subjects you teach interesting let s face it some subjects you need to teach students are exciting while others can be downright boring and not everyone teachers and students both agrees on which subject is which therefore regardless of what subject you re teaching you need to make it inviting interesting and intriguing to your students 6 x research source engage and interact with your students while you re teaching don t just write endless words on the board rather than telling your students everything ask them to provide opinions ideas or even guesses ask your students to explain why something is the way it is sometimes understanding the why makes understanding the what much easier invent and play games that teach the subject in an interactive and exciting manner use images pictures and videos as often as possible if the subject can be taught hands on get your students involved in the lesson read the article how to make learning fun add humour to your classroom every day laughter is the best medicine sometimes but it can also be a great learning and teaching tool being able to make something funny or joke about something embarrassing makes you human students like to see their teachers as human 7 x research source there is a never ending array of comics and memes on the internet for just about any subject you can think of consider finding these pictures and putting them up around the classroom think about including a joke of the day or other activity to your classroom to start off a lesson and grab your students attention laugh at some of the jokes your students say as part of their answers yes it may mean they didn t study but getting mad at them isn t likely to help don t take yourself too seriously teaching isn t easy and you re going to mess up every now and again try not to get upset about your mistakes instead find humour in the situation when you can and laugh about it show off your great personality there s a reason you wanted to be a teacher maybe it s because you love kids or because you like the idea of preparing the next generation for the future regardless you re a teacher because you wanted to be and you have a great personality use your personality to customize the way you teach or the way you decorate your classroom 8 x research source you may teach a subject that you absolutely love more than anything else in the world show that passion off to your students it s amazing how contagious passion can be smile you are both a teacher and a human being you have your own personal problems outside of the classroom while it s hard don t bring those personal problems to the classroom remember that your students have nothing to do with your personal problems most likely and don t need to be punished because you have a personal problem ongoing in your life once you walk in the door of the school put your personal problems aside until you re outside of school again smile to your students and other teachers and keep that smile going throughout your whole day have one or more class pets animals are awesome and they can teach students a large number of different skills and abilities depending on the age and type of classroom you have consider adding one or more pet to the classroom use that pet as a way to teach your students responsibility and other important life skills 9 x research source allow your students to decide what they want to do every so often maybe once a week at a certain time allow your students to decide what they want to do or learn maybe this time is a special play time where your students get to pick what game they want to play divide the decision making between different students or groups allow your students to become part of the teaching process 10 x research source this might also be a great opportunity to have your students present to the class instead of you make it an assignment that each student or group of students has to present a topic of their choice to the class add music to your classroom music can do a lot of wonderful things for people if you have a way to incorporate music into your classroom or lessons do so maybe you even have the ability to allow your students to select the music 11 x research source find hands on ways to teach a lesson students are individuals and they all learn differently making sure they have ways to experience a lesson outside of the textbook or homework is a great way to enhance learning consider more hands on ways to enrich your lesson planning if you are learning about local history plan a field trip to a local museum when teaching a new math concept use math manipulatives so they can see and feel the lesson,Education-and-Communications
how to become a music teacher,many people want to be music teachers because it allows them not only to pursue their own passion for music but also to share this passion with others however it is also a profession that involves many years of training often starting in childhood,make sure you have the necessary musical chops you probably would not be interested in becoming a music teacher if you did

history and theory including ap music theory child psychology is also a natural fit for people interested in becoming music teachers try subjects like computers and math you might be surprised at the others kinds of classes that may be helpful since so much of music is now technology driven make sure you take the necessary classes to become computer literate aspiring composers in particular may find that they enjoy advanced math classes and that these classes help them think about music in new ways consider taking private music lessons it s great to play in your school s band or sing in the chorus but if you want to attend a good program you will need to do more than that private lessons can be pricey but the right teacher can help take your skills to the next level your teacher can also be a useful resource in identifying the best schools for you and preparing for auditions which most music programs will require listen to other people s music you should be familiar with a range of

education ncate and the national association of schools of music nasm narrow the field by thinking not only about the best schools but also the best schools for you research tuition and scholarships both those offered by the school and by outside organizations think about location each state has its own teacher certification process so you might want to think about attending a school where faculty and advisors can guide you through this process in the state where you want to teach at some schools you can receive initial certification by completing the curriculum visit the campus university websites can tell you a lot about size geographical location and even courses only visiting the department can really tell you whether the culture and feel are right for you get ready for your audition most music and music education programs will require not only an application with test scores grades personal statements and letters of recommendation but also a live audition this can be nerve wracking be prepared you probably already know to practice practice practice your pieces but practice the conditions of audition day also do this by performing your pieces for family and friends making sure you think about all the aspects of the audition dressing professionally greeting the committee maintaining poise etc 4 x research source stay excited about your pieces practice them in lots of different ways so that on audition day you are focused on the music rather than your nerves 5 x research source the day of the audition focus on your breathing make sure you are doing so deeply from your diaphragm this is especially important for singers but it will also help to calm your nerves and so applies to everyone don t rush when you are nervous you tend to speed up your committee wants to see someone who can really interpret the music not just pound out the notes 6 x research source know that mistakes will happen this is ok your committee members are looking for potential not perfection you are auditioning to be a student after all you still have a lot to learn and they know this 7 x research source complete all of your required coursework your coursework will largely fall into three categories musical practice and knowledge pedagogy and general liberal arts requirements 8 x research source musical practice and knowledge courses will likely include instrumental or vocal training ear training and sight reading music theory and music history pedagogy courses will likely include development psychology methods for teaching elementary and secondary school students and advanced study on special educational topics of your choice liberal arts requirements are more open but they will likely include writing and or literature courses with these complex requirements you should meet with your advisor early on and before each semester s registration to make sure you are on track for graduation consider pursuing a music education graduate degree you will need to hold at least a master s degree if you wish to teach at the college level doing this immediately has some drawbacks though if you attend a graduate program without any teaching experience you may price yourself out of the market fulfill any requirements that you did not complete during your coursework the state where you wish to become certified will look at your coursework and transcripts to make sure you have fulfilled all of their requirements you might need to take more classes before you can receive initial certification 9 x research source take the general teacher certification exam this test will assess will test your knowledge of both core liberal arts and sciences topics and teaching skills and you will need to pass it before you can move on 10 x research source take the music subject area certification exam you will also need to demonstrate your master of the subject area you will be teaching while these vary by state there are some things you will probably need to know anywhere testing areas will likely include music theory music performance listening skills and music history and culture questions will likely be a combination of multiple choice and essay format apply to jobs in schools many people who train to become music teachers are primarily interested in finding full time work in schools but this is not always easy to do for starters funding for the arts regularly comes under attack 11 x trustworthy source us bureau of labor statistics u s government agency that collects and reports labor related information go to source moreover many teachers are waiting longer to retire for these reasons aspiring music teachers need to be proactive on the job market 12 x research source start applying for jobs before you graduate it can take a while so be patient be prepared to relocate the uncertainties of the job market might mean that you are not able to get a job in your first choice of location make yourself an attractive candidate with many more applicants than there are positions you will need to find a way of setting yourself apart maintain your own musical chops you ll be better prepared to educate others if you stay excited about performance and are constantly improving your skills as you deepen your skills make sure you broaden them as well in a crowded market a singer saxophonist virtuoso improviser will be a more attractive candidate than someone who can do only one of these things stay up to date on technology it is rapidly introducing not only new ways of producing music but also new methods of teaching it consider teaching private lessons whether due to financial exigencies or preference many music teachers end up giving private lessons teaching out of your home or studio can offer more flexible hours the chance to connect with students one on one and the opportunity to work with many different ages and ability levels but there are also some drawbacks there is no required certification process for individuals who wish to teach music privately although the music teachers national association does offer a certification 13 x research source moreover the people paying you for your services are depending on your skills talents and patience if you cannot deliver they may take their business elsewhere if you are a performer it can be easier to balance rehearsals and performances with a private teaching schedule you can also decide how many students you want to take on however you will need to create individual lesson plans for each of your students while it can be freeing not to be beholden to a curriculum it can be very time consuming as well 14 x research source you also cannot rely on a steady income the way teachers in schools can at least on a year to year basis your business will

how to be a better relief teacher,relief or substitute teaching is different to regular classroom teaching you are a brand new face and have not developed meaningful relationships yet with your students likewise the students need time to acclimate to you students will regard you differently at first and will not be familiar with your style of teaching they may even see this as an opportunity to take advantage of you or mislead you as you are the newcomer on the block if you are going to be teaching for multiple days it is imperative to communicate your boundaries and expectations of the class immediately,prepare ahead of time the best way to bridge the gap is to communicate with the teacher you are relieving and asking her how she runs the class how she handles disputes who the mischievous kids are and any things that are unique to his her teaching style so you can replicate them as best as possible if the teacher is unavailable to answer your questions ask the teachers that work next door to her or perhaps ask the faculty in the teacher s lounge what your teacher was like remember the right decision is not always the most popular one canceling a homework assignment might make the students love you that day but it sets them back in the long run instead of skipping an assignment make it fun and interesting always keep focused on the main outcome of your lesson this should be clearly established in your own mind well before you start the lesson write the answer to this question somewhere in your diary at the end of this lesson i want kids to reinforce the purpose of the lesson students may see work as annoying time consuming pointless and something that prevents them from doing something fun like watching tv playing outside etc a lot of the time these feelings arise because students do not understand the relevancy of the assignment in their life the simple question why is this important how will doing this assignment benefit me if you can think ahead of time good fun and witty answers to these questions before you teach you can change the attitude of resistant students and mold them into receptive and eager vessels of knowledge but you need to help them understand why it s worth missing their fav tv show or playing outside for less time than they did yesterday don t give out all the information all the time some time kids want to explore options to get information give out books computer access and or website for students to search show the students how to use common search engines like google consider group work as an option there is no doubt that group work is the chatty option having kids facing other kids is a sure fire bet to start discussion but if discussion is important to your lesson then perhaps group work is a great option investigations are powerful learning opportunities investigations are those activities avoided by most relief teachers because they are usually difficult to organize on the spot allow some time to think students need time to think and process new concepts relief teachers because they know content and skills sometimes go on without giving kids the take up time needed to understand a concept sometimes relief teachers talk too fast and pepper the students with questions and activities without giving them time to process you know the old adage stop and smell the roses that is also true in the classroom be mindful that students in your class may be at completely different levels some process things extremely quick others take a lot of time while some need repetition encourage discussion what is the article about do you think the article is bias is there anything you would like to know that the article did not mention and more investigatory questions like that allow students the time to talk check out this strategy honestly everyone needs to be given a chance to talk put 30 adults together in a small room and tell them to be quiet it is not a practical application of learning share your learning process there is nothing more valuable to a student learner than to see a master at work when learning a new concept vocalize the thought processes you use to interpret meaning show your class how you develop meaning be pragmatic sometimes lessons develop in a completely different way than you expected sometimes that can be a good thing so how do you know the difference is the main thing still the main thing if not then bring the lesson back and consider the matter another day,Education-and-Communications
how to become a teacher as a second career,becoming a certified teacher may seem like a confusing and overwhelming process and you may be nervous about entering the field of education without any experience don t worry though your certification program will explain most of the complicated steps as you complete them and many schools will look at your previous career as a benefit to become certified choose an age group to teach enroll in college graduate school or an alternative certification program and complete your student teaching to become certified once certified apply for positions and explain how your old career taught helped you cultivate the skills needed to run a classroom,look up the different teaching certifications where you live teaching certifications are separated based on the grades and classes that an educator can teach since the divisions are different everywhere search your board of education s website to find out how your region arranges their teaching certifications 1 x research source don t get discouraged by this process if it seems confusing at first as you start your certification process all of the specifics will be clarified and explained by your teachers and advisors all teaching certificates are specific to the region where you register them for example if you get a teaching certificate in louisiana you cannot teach in michigan if you re certified in japan you cannot teach in canada this process uses grade divisions as they are named in the united states the labels and grades may have different names where you live for example 7th grade is called year 8 in the united kingdom the overall process is generally the same in most countries though go into early childhood education to work with younger students select an early childhood certification if you want to work with students that are 4 7 years old in the united states this certification is typically for pre kindergarten to first grade early childhood educators usually teach every subject included rudimentary math letter identification and word recognition 2 x research source early education teachers are in high demand and it is generally pretty easy to find work as an early education teacher select an elementary certification to teach 2nd 8th grade an elementary certification will prepare you to teach students that are 7 14 years old in the united states this will allow you to teach 2nd through 8th grade become an elementary teacher if you want to work with more in depth material without focusing too much on any single subject but still enjoy working with younger students 3 x research source some states countries and regions have a separate certification for 6th 8th grade 11 to 13 year old students teachers typically teach every class in 2nd 5th grade but there are usually different elementary certificate endorsements for 6th to 8th grade teachers that allow them to specialize in certain subjects like math english or science elementary teachers are in moderate demand you may encounter some trouble finding work but it shouldn t be extremely difficult pick a secondary education program to teach high school to teach 14 to 18 year old students pursue a secondary education certificate teachers that work with older students delve deeply into their respective subjects for example a math teacher may teach advanced algebra or geometric proofs these certifications are organized based on the subject matter that you are allowed to teach 4 x research source the most difficult areas to find secondary teaching work in are music art english history and physical education the easiest subjects to get hired in are math science and esl english as a second language esl certificates are usually an optional endorsement for english teachers which is why english teachers without an esl endorsement typically have a harder time finding work in some regions the secondary education certificate allows you to teach 6th 12th grade 11 to 18 year old students go into special education to work with students with disabilities special education teachers work with students with disabilities to ensure that their individual learning needs are met at some schools special education teachers work alongside general education teachers to assist specific groups of students go into special education if you want to work with smaller groups of students and use a variety of teaching styles 5 x research source in some regions special education teachers can work with any age group in other states special education certificates are divided by age like other certifications in the united states you can get a special education endorsement on your standard certification so that you can teach classrooms with a high number of students with disabilities special education teachers have arguably the easiest time finding work since they re in high demand and schools are typically legally required to hire a large number of them attend an undergraduate program if you never went to college you cannot teach at a school if you never graduated from an accredited 4 year university apply for a college near you that has an education certification program major in early education middle school education or secondary education based on your chosen certification path 6 x research source most colleges have a certification program for teachers built into the curriculum if you major in early education for example you ll complete your student teaching while you re still in school and graduate with your teaching certificate it will take 4 years to graduate from an undergraduate program it will cost roughly 5 000 30 000 a year depending on where you live you cannot earn a teaching certificate at a community college the certification process starts around 6 months before you graduate you will submit test scores transcripts letters of recommendation and proof of student teaching to the state or region where you live to get certified get a graduate degree in education if you already completed undergrad if you already have an undergraduate degree and want to get a thorough education in teaching go to graduate school look for a graduate program at a university near you and apply by sending in your transcripts test scores and application sign up for a program specific to the type of certification that you ve chosen 7 x research source you will have to retake the sat or complete an entrance exam if you live in the united states and you graduated from college more than 6 years ago graduate school will take 2 years to complete and will cost around 10 000 25 000 a year teachers with graduate degrees earn more money than their non graduate counterparts they also have an easier time finding open teaching positions enter an alternative certification program for a faster certification alternative certification programs are 4 12 month programs that certify teachers quickly some are operated by private businesses but most of them take place at public universities although you won t graduate with an advanced degree apply for an alternative certification in your field to get certified quickly or if you already have an undergraduate degree that isn t in education 8 x research source alternative certification classes are extremely rigorous since they cram a lot of information into a shorter period of time but they still aren t as thorough as a 4 or 2 year year program alternative certification classes typically cost 500 10 000 consult with your certification advisor to follow the protocol where you live the certification process is different depending on where you live every state requires different materials for certification on top of that the legal requirements can be quite confusing on their own since a lot of the guidelines are hard to understand and interpret meet with your college or program advisor regularly to go over the application process 9 x research source don t worry if the certification process doesn t make sense right away certification programs will walk you through everything that you need to do attend your classes and complete the coursework whether you re in an undergraduate graduate or alternative program show up for every class and take diligent notes study the different pedagogies and learning theories and complete every reading assignment participate in class ask questions and turn in your essays to ensure that you learn all that you can about your new career 10 x research source pedagogy is a fancy word for educational philosophy it s important to understand the key pedagogical theories to respond to questions during your future interviews and to apply different strategies in the classroom you will also learn how to write lesson plans create unit plans manage a classroom and assess student learning through tests discussions and skill checks complete your field experience by observing veteran teachers while you re attending classes and completing classwork you will likely need to complete field experiences your teacher will assign you to follow veteran teachers around during the school day so that you can see how master educators teach after each observation ask the teacher to sign the document that proves you observed them and ask questions about their teaching strategy and approach to classroom management 11 x research source depending on where you live you will need to complete 15 100 hours of field experience hold on to your field experience documentation you will submit it to the state when you apply for certification pass your independent exams to qualify for certification complete your certification specific tests at a private testing facility at least 3 months before you plan on submitting your certification portfolio these exams will test your knowledge of the subject teaching theories and general academic skills these exams are different depending on where you live the certification you re pursing your highest degree obtained and what your sat scores are 12 x research source in the united states you may need to take the general aptitude test which will gauge your knowledge of a variety of subjects this means that you may need to brush up on your math skills even if you re becoming a foreign language teacher the number and type of tests that you need to take are based on a variety of factors so don t get upset or concerned if your classmates are required to take different tests your teacher or advisor will help you sign up for these exams but they must be completed outside of class at a private testing facility hold on to a copy of your test score you may need to include it in your documentation when you apply for certification the testing facility often sends it to the board of education for you though let your teaching program pair you up with a mentor teacher when you have around 6 months left in your program your certification program will assign you to a mentor teacher for student teaching once assigned send an email to your mentor teacher introducing yourself and expressing enthusiasm for your new assignment ask them when they d like to sit down and discuss the start of your student teaching 13 x research source you may be able to list a preference for a specific school or certain teacher that you observed during your field experience but you cannot choose a student teaching assignment or sign up for one on your own mentor teachers have a ton of control over what this process will look like so ask them questions about when you ll start teaching what kind of material you should prepare and when you will take full control over the classroom observe your mentor s classes and ask questions at the beginning of student teaching you will observe the mentor teacher to get a sense of how they run their classes pay attention to how they take attendance structure discussions and deal with student outbursts ask questions during your independent meetings to figure out why their classes look the way they do this observation period will likely take 1 2 weeks 14 x research source some mentor teachers will throw you right into things and have you run the class on your first day if you re uncomfortable with this there s nothing wrong with asking to watch for a few days your goal as you re starting out at least should be to keep the structure of your class identical to the way your mentor does things it is extremely hard for students to adapt to new structures without explanation or practice and they may take a few weeks to get used to you to begin with take over for the mentor teacher and run the class for 3 4 months once you ve observed the teacher for some time take over for the mentor teacher run the class take attendance assign homework and develop your lesson plans run the mentor teacher s classes for 3 4 months to complete the student teaching process 15 x research source your mentor teacher may observe you as you teach to provide feedback but they will likely leave the room after a few weeks to let you get used to teaching on your own if you need to film yourself teaching as part of your certification make sure that the parents of the students sign a waiver student teaching is not fake or practice teaching you literally become the full time teacher you will assign grades meet with parents and sign off on report cards get letters of recommendation from your mentor teacher and program to demonstrate that you ve completed the necessary training get a letter of recommendation from your school or certification class then get a letter of approval from your mentor teacher to demonstrate that you successfully completed student teaching 16 x research source in the united states you typically don t need a letter of recommendation from your school or certification program they ll send the documentation that you completed the program for you send your certification portfolio to the state after student teaching this process is different depending on where you live and what your certification is in but you will submit your portfolio at the end of student teaching gather the letters of recommendation from your mentor teacher and certification program add your test scores transcripts and any additional documents that you need to include either upload your materials to the licensure portal for your state or mail the portfolio to your board of education 17 x research source almost every region requires you to upload your portfolio to an online portal the most common portal in the united states is edtpa which is used for certification in 18 states it may be 1 16 weeks before you hear back about whether you ve been certified or not if your portfolio is rejected the state or certifying body will explain what needs to be fixed you can usually re upload a portfolio 2 3 times before you must repeat the certification process create a resume that highlights your past experience on your teaching resume put your certification at the top of the page under your name and contact information in the section for work experience list the skills from your previous job that translate to teaching management quality control and organization are excellent skills when it comes to appealing to schools and showcasing your experience 18 x research source include any examples where you taught peers or customers in your previous line of work something as simple as running a professional development session is a good inclusion for a teaching resume for example if you were an accountant saying you solved complex math problems to ensure that accounts were balanced and managed multiple accounts is a great way to appeal to principals and hiring managers choose a type of school to apply to based on your preferences there are 3 distinct types of schools in most countries public schools private schools and charter schools public schools typically pay more money but you won t have as much freedom

don t exist at other schools they don t pay as much as charters or public schools even if the tuition is expensive but teachers at private schools tend to have more freedom when it comes to what and how they teach ask your school or certification program for leads on open positions to start looking for work ask your certification program if they have any leads on nearby teaching positions most

different location tutor students in your home if you have the space and privacy sometimes the parents or students may expect you to provide a location for tutoring you can invite them to come to your home for convenience and to save yourself the commute however you will need to create a designated tutoring area and keep the space tidy also if the student s parents are late to pick them up you may have to entertain them work in a public location if you don t want to tutor in your home if you aren t comfortable or don t have the space to bring students to your home you can tutor them in a public

them 7 x research source this can also be a great way to gain some tutoring experience with a reputable company this will look good on your résumé if you try to branch out on your own later of course

how much they charge for their services do an online search to gather information about how much other tutors in your area charge sign up for online payment options if you go into business for yourself you should consider opening an online payment account to make it easy for your clients to pay you in whatever way is most convenient for them being able to offer credit card acceptance could make the difference between getting a client or not there are several options for this including paypal and venmo cash can be such a hassle for parents to remember for every session if you have a paypal option this might make things much easier for the parents this often translates to repeat customers insist on payment after each tutoring session be sure that your clients stay up to date on their payments you should get paid for each session at the beginning or end of that session if a student or their parents don t pay you for a session you should not give them another session until the balance is paid it can be all too easy for people to get behind and then it could turn into money you ll never receive for services you already supplied you can consider creating payment invoices for each lesson to help the students parents stay on top of the financial end of your arrangement,Education-and-Communications

the end of the session write down the goals on a sheet of paper and have the student keep track of it putting them in charge of the goal tracker gives them more responsibility for their own improvement track the student s progress create a chart that allows you and your student to assess how well he or she is doing both in your sessions and in class this chart can include entries for quiz and test grades overall class grades achievement of the goals you set up together your evaluation of the student s effort your evaluation of the student s understanding of concepts celebrate improvement in qualitative assessments like grades with a lot of praise if the student s grades aren t improving but you see a lot of effort your chart will help keep him or her from getting discouraged open with questions about material covered in the last session before moving on to new material you want to make sure your student has mastered the old material ask one or two open ended

opportunities to succeed while you should be working toward goals you don t want to discourage your student by setting the bar too high every session should include exercises you know the student can complete successfully from there you can build on the lessons toward more complex exercises that may prove more challenging if the student doesn t perform at the level you expected don t give up repeat the exercise until he or she completes it correctly when they do heap praise on the student for working through an obstacle give your students breaks the breaks should be no longer than 5 minutes working for long stretches time might wear them out and make them lose focus a 5 minute break is just enough time to refresh students without breaking stride in the work you re doing adapt to student needs 4 x research source you have goals laid out but sometimes young people get worn down by their work just like adults do if your student seems tired or in a bad mood on a given day don t be afraid to mix things up a little and lighten the mood for example if you re tutoring a student in a foreign language you might listen to and translate songs instead of going through conjugation exercises you might watch cartoons in that language and see how much of the plot the student can follow cater your tutoring style to the student s learning style 5 x research source not all children learn in the same way some students work better alone and will do better if given time to complete activities on their own others are more social learners who will learn more if it seems like you re working through the problems with them aural students learn best through verbal explanation so talk to them about concepts verbal students need to talk through concepts on their own so be willing to sit back and listen physical tactile students need to work with their hands bring in 3d models if you re studying anatomy or clay that they can shape into the different organs of the body visual students might need graphic aids like pictures charts or educational videos end each session by looking forward to the next one 6 x research source the end of a tutoring session doesn t mean the student is finished for the week make clear that you expect them to prepare for your next session in the time you re apart if there s any work that wasn t finished during the session assign it as homework for the next meeting if you have a fun activity planned for the next session give the student something to look forward to build a personal relationship with your students 7 x trustworthy source edutopia educational nonprofit organization focused on encouraging and celebrating classroom innovation go to source your job is to help students perform up to their potential as such you re as much friend and cheerleader at times as you are instructor by forming personal connections with students you can more effectively motivate them to succeed talk about how the subject makes them feel students who perform poorly in class may feel ashamed of it when they improve they may feel powerful and proud comfort them in their down times and celebrate their successes share your own experiences of failure and how you overcame them find out what their passions are so you can make the tutoring sessions more interesting a straightforward equation might seem boring but a subtraction problem about fighting dinosaurs might perk up a student who loves dinosaurs learn the student s communication style connect to the student on their own terms if a student is intensely shy you can t ignore it it may be that the student communicates best in the days between sessions when he or she can email you questions sometimes students are reluctant to ask questions in person even though they have many they need answered show up for each session in a good mood your students will pick up on your moods immediately if you seem tired or low energy they will mimic your tone but if you show up smiling and optimistic for every session they ll follow your lead and put more effort into the work at hand act as a guide rather than teacher teachers and tutors have very different roles teachers have many students to oversee at once and must act as authority figures who pass on knowledge tutors work one on one though and are more like educated peers than authority figures you only have one student to work with at a time so you don t have to lecture let students take charge of learning objectives and guide them toward their goals 8 x research source ask a lot of questions you don t want to lecture your students instead ask open ended questions that force them to come to conclusions on their own with research you help them conduct give students room to fall in love with the material while you need to keep the student on track to achieve their goals don t be afraid to give up a little control if when studying the civil war your student wants to spend a lot of time on an unimportant but dramatic battle let it happen even if it eats up a whole session a tutor should let natural curiosity grow rather than trying to smother it the increased enthusiasm will pay off down the line communicate clearly with parents and teachers without their help you won t know how to focus the content of your sessions in a way that will help your students succeed in school talking to parents and teachers is especially important for younger students while a high schooler might be able to explain course objectives to you a third grader won t reach out to the parents and teacher s and set up a regular schedule for communication you might speak to the parents every time the student is brought in for a tutoring session you might agree to email the teacher on the first monday of each month to get a sense of what s coming down the pipe in the student s classwork,Education-and-Communications

how to tutor mathematics,for many people mathematics is one of the most challenging subjects in school students that struggle find it helpful to get personalized one on one tutoring in order to be a good mathematics tutor you need to be patient and have a strong knowledge of the concepts that the student is struggling with with some guided problem solving and encouragement your tutees will be succeeding at math in no time,know the material if you know algebra really well but are not as strong in calculus only tutor algebra your students are learning from you and they can t do that if you don t know the material inside and out 1 x research source you also want to make sure you know the math standards that your student is expected to be proficient in if you can t solve all of the problems your student presents you you shouldn t be tutoring the subject review the material you will be teaching before you meet with your student if you re unsure about something don t give your student the wrong information look up the right answer later and discuss that concept at the next session relate math skills to everyday life many students struggle with math because they don t understand the practical applications of it if you can put the material in the context of their lives they are more likely to understand and learn it 2 x research source ask your student about some of their favorite hobbies and try to incorporate those in your lessons if you re tutoring statistics and they like baseball use baseball stats to help them learn remind the student that they are intelligent making mistakes is a part of learning and even the best mathematicians still make mistakes sometimes making mistakes does not mean that the student is stupid or that they suck at math for younger students it can be especially important to keep up their confidence highlight the parts of the problem the student got right while correcting the errors to understand why it was wrong use phrases that emphasize the content they got right such as you did this part of the problem really well and the way you re thinking about this is really smart encourage questions asking questions is essential to success in math guide your student s learning by asking them pointed questions that will help them get to the right answer instead of just telling them questions also help engage the student in the learning process 3 x research source make your tutor sessions a safe space where there are no stupid questions if the student is confused about anything they need to clarify that before they can move on to other concepts some good questions to ask your students does the solution make sense what exactly is the problem asking for and what techniques do you know that could help you solve the problem talk about math anxiety some of your students may have actual anxiety when trying to deal with math talk to your student about this and refer them to a counselor if you think the math anxiety is particularly serious if you think your tutee is in a course that is too advanced for them discuss the possibility of moving to a course on their level 4 x research source avoid using phrases like this problem is easy as this can intimidate a student who doesn t think it s easy at all ask your student some of these questions to determine if they have math anxiety do you feel helpless when working on math or taking a quiz test do you think you re the only one that doesn t understand math and everyone else is smarter than you are do you second guess everything you do hoping others will do the work for you provide positive feedback when they solve a problem all on their own note that they now understand the material and congratulate them on this accomplishment this encouragement will strengthen their confidence in solving future problems 5 x research source frequent feedback helps the student know what they understand and what concepts they need to work on encouragement is particularly helpful for students who have math anxiety choose a specific problem to work through usually this will be a problem from the student s homework textbook or class you should choose the easiest problem the student has difficulty solving work multiple examples of the same concept if a student is struggling with math they are likely not going to understand a concept by doing one problem succeeding in math is about repetition and practice 6 x research source ask the student if they have any problems they specifically want to work through before beginning doing multiple examples allows students to make connections and understand the similarities between the examples gaining a firm understanding of the concept ask the student to attempt the problem as they work through the problem have them explain to you both what they do in each step and why this will help them understand what they are doing and help you determine where they are going wrong in the solving 7 x research source if they get stuck ask questions to help get them on the right track what techniques do you know that might help you solve this is there anything about this problem that is similar to another problem you know how to solve make sure they write down every step of the process to determine where things went wrong if the answer is incorrect correct any errors that are made often the student cannot find the correct solution because they made an error while solving the problem if so correct the error for them and ask them why they think it s wrong if they can t figure it out tell them why it s wrong and offer suggestions on how to avoid making that error in the future guide the student through the problem when the student asks what do i do next do not show them how to solve the problem instead show them how you would perform the next step try to avoid solving the problem for them but show them the concept 8 x research source for example if the student has come to the sum of two unlike fractions show them how to add two unlike fractions using variables or numerals as appropriate to their level of mathematics ask the student to explain the problem again now that you have corrected their errors and guided them in the right direction let the student attempt to progress through the problem once more ask them to explain the problem to make sure they truly understand the material and are not just repeating what you said 9 x research source avoid asking questions such as do you understand or does that make sense recognize that there is more than one way to solve a problem your student may approach a problem differently or may benefit from you explaining the concept in a different way make sure your tutee knows that it s okay to solve the problem in the way that makes the most sense to them 10 x research source sometimes kids can get caught up in the fact that the method you are teaching is not the way the teacher taught it let them know that it s okay as long as they understand the fundamental concept repeat this process with similar problems correct errors and guide your student through the problem until they obtain the correct solution then choose a new problem that is similar to the first and do it all over again reinforce the correct procedures until the student can do that type of problem without help or errors 11 x research source go through this whole process again with a new type of problem keep good records if you have multiple tutees you want to make sure you don t lose track of any of them keep a binder or notebook where you track each student and the progress they have made use these records to help you plan your next session together review what was taught the week before and decide what new material to cover make a note after each session about concepts that you taught and what the student needs more work on foster a good tutoring environment a good tutoring environment is not just the location where you tutor you must let the student know that tutoring sessions are a safe space where they can ask any and all questions without feeling stupid be empathetic toward your student and the struggles they face with the material 12 x research source integrate humor into a session to help the student feel relaxed choose a quiet space where you will be uninterrupted or distracted for the entire session communicate with your clients a good tutor knows their client and understands their needs if you are trying to teach them things they already know or things that are way beyond their knowledge the tutoring isn t going to help them talk to them about what they want to get out of the tutoring sessions and how you can help them schedule each appointment at least a week in advance and confirm these tutoring sessions the day before be flexible with the material if you scheduled certain material but your client wants to work on something else listen to them do not force your agenda on them because that s what you planned for the day set boundaries before you begin tutoring a student discuss with them your boundaries let them know about your schedule and how often you are available make your own judgment call about whether or not your students can call text facebook you outside of tutoring sessions during tutoring sessions all distractions such as phones tablets computers should be turned off and put away tutors and tutees should both abide by a code of ethics 13 x research source seek out new clients when you are first starting finding clients can be difficult posting fliers around university campuses can be a good way to start you can also work directly with a tutoring center and have them find clients for you 14 x research source use the network of people you know to get the word out ask your friends and family to let their friends and family know that you are looking to tutor willing students use the internet to find new clients setup a professional internet page and

expert source sean alexander ms academic tutor expert interview 14 may 2020 don t wing it you want to make sure you re making the most of your time make a brief outline of what you re going to do how much time each thing should take and what the student will learn during each lesson continually adjust these expectations based on your student s progress 5 x research source practice the problems the last thing you want is to have your student arrive only to discover you can t actually work the problem work through every problem a few times in advance so you re certain to be able to offer them guidance as they solve the problem remember there is often more than one way to solve the problem so keep track of the student s method and give them a chance to find the right answer then walk them through the simplest way to solve 6 x research source walk students through your lesson plan when the student arrives take a few moments to tell them what you re going to cover make sure they don t have homework to do or a quiz to prepare for that may be more pressing 7 x expert source sean alexander ms academic tutor expert interview 14 may 2020 even though you took a great deal of time to prepare for the session be flexible and accommodate your students whenever possible 8 x research source an example may be saying something such as i remember you said you were having trouble with absolute value equations i thought we could work a few of those together then i d like you to work a few independently if the student agrees you can follow up with something like before we get started what specific questions about absolute value do you have you should also double check that there isn t a more pressing topic they need to cover is absolute value still a topic you re concerned about now or do you have upcoming assignment you want to look at first encourage questions you may think you re doing a great job of explaining everything but it s important to periodically ensure your student is on the same page asking students if they have questions and taking time to answer them seriously is important try not to get annoyed or frustrated if it seems like you ve answered the same questions for your student just encourage them to keep trying they ll get there establish early on that the student should stop you anytime they need to ask a question avoid saying things like does that makes sense or do you understand this may discourage students who want to impress you or those who don t want to take more time with the subject by asking for more information instead try something like do you have questions better yet say what questions do you have this tells the student you expect them to have questions 9 x research source work through a problem together now that you ve established the plan for the day start by working through a problem together you can do this a number of different ways but the goal is to improve students confidence in their ability to do the problems and find out where they will likely need your help 10 x expert source sean alexander ms academic tutor expert interview 14 may 2020 try asking the student to tell you what needs to be done and attempt the problem based on their instructions then make corrections as needed for instance in the equation 8 x 7 4 6 x 7 6 the first step should be getting the variables of x 7 on the same side of the equation if the student starts out by saying you need to divide each of the variables by the multiplier i e 6 x 7 6 explain that the equation may be easier if you instead have both 8 x 7 and 6 x 7 on the same side of the equation walking the student through the problem let them do the actual figuring on paper or computers as this helps them remember but tell them each step in the sample problem above you would give them the equation and say the first step is to get both 8 x 7 and 6 x 7 on the same side of the equation how would you do that trading the problem back and forth you start the student down the right track then let them determine what they need to do next using the same absolute value equation above you would get both 8 x 7 and 6 x 7 on the left side of the equation then ask the student to complete the next step getting the 4 and 6 on the same side of the equation by subtracting 4 from both sides if they do this you can move forward if not explain what they should have done and continue to the next step you can trade the problem back and forth in this manner until it s done 11 x research source let your student attempt a problem when you re done working through one or more problems together give the student one to work on independently let them take as much time as they need to find the solution try not to help them with the problem even if they get frustrated just encourage them to keep going until they get an answer it doesn t have to be the right answer this will help the student get used to working through tough problems on their own 12 x expert source sean alexander ms academic tutor expert interview 14 may 2020 guide them through corrections once the student solves their problem review it with them let them know where they got off course tell them what the correct method would have been and make sure to ask them if they have questions for you this allows them to build independence when it comes to solving problems while continuing to help them improve their algebra skills 13 x research source take the sample absolute value equation 8 x 7 4 6 x 7 6 if the student begins the problem by dividing each side by 6 rather than adding 6 x 7 to each side they end up with a very different result x 6 or 15 2 rather than the correct x 7 or 50 7 but they can achieve an answer let the student solve the problem then walk them back through the equation the correct way ask the student to walk you through the problem after your student has completed the problem and you ve reviewed and corrected it have them start over from the beginning and walk you through how to solve the problem this gives them the opportunity to rehash what they just learned from a different perspective if they can accurately explain how to complete the process they are more likely to retain the information 14 x research source repeat as needed have your student work problems until they can solve two or more in a row without error when they reach this point you can move on to something new if you still have time otherwise ask them if they have any questions and begin planning for your next session 15 x research source assign homework they might hate their homework but you really want to make sure they understand the material if they have an assignment in their class that s covering the same subject this may be adequate so make sure you ask them what their homework is for class inform the parent guardian about their assignment too if their parents know they have homework from you they may be more likely to get the work done 16 x research source even if the students have a great deal of homework assign them two or three extra equations ask the student to text or email you a photo of their completed equations as they finish you can then send feedback letting them know whether or not they ve gotten the correct answer or need to make another attempt plan your next session before the student leaves schedule your upcoming study time ask if there are any tests or assignments coming up that they would like to focus on if the student pays you directly you can also obtain payment at this time seek new clients make sure your information is available online make a website with contact information pricing schedule of when you re available and subjects you re able to tutor you can also advertise on craigslist and other websites reach out to local middle schools high schools community colleges and universities to ask how you can advertise on their campus 17 x research source join an online tutor community 18 x expert

t trust atoms because i heard they make up everything practice often your students will need to have frequent opportunities to work through science problems and concepts allow them to work through an idea from start to finish going one step at a time 3 x expert source ronitte libedinsky ms academic tutor expert interview 26 may 2020 then give them constructive feedback about their process make

you do if you are tutoring multiple students give them a chance to discuss problems with each other any time a question or answer is given allow the students to reflect on the science concepts behind the question 5 x research source for example if you are covering material related to the shape of a water molecule you might ask the students to consider why it is a different shape from another three atom molecule such as carbon dioxide rather than telling them the answer right off prompt them to think about the electrons on oxygen you might say what is it about oxygen that would push the hydrogens closer to each other giving water a bent geometry vary your study place a change of scenery from time to time will give your tutoring sessions a natural relaxed feel get out of the classroom and go to science exhibits or do your own experiments that are relevant to the topic you are tutoring this breaks the monotony of the classroom 6 x research source for example if you are teaching a

might be how comfortable are you speaking about the material we cover in a tutoring session graduate high school to be a successful tutor you will need a background in science high school is designed to lay the foundation of several different subjects including the sciences a high school diploma is also an important stepping stone to higher education 9 x research source if you did not graduate high school you can obtain a graduate equivalency degree or ged obtain a college degree with a college degree you can specialize in a particular science in a way that high school does not offer major in physics chemistry biology or another science program you also have the option to get a teaching degree with a science concentration 10 x research source complete a tutor certification a tutor certification is important for getting hired on to some tutoring companies or school boards there are multiple certifying organizations such as the national tutoring association and the american tutoring association 11 x research source tutoring certifications usually require that you pass an exam usually a fee is involved and there may be classes offered to prepare you for the exam you should look at the guidelines given by the certifying body that you wish to be affiliated with start with your area of specialty people often choose tutors because the tutor is a specialist in their field having the experience and knowledge beyond that of the average person will allow you to structure your teachings with direction and purpose look for tutoring jobs in the field s that you specialize or have degrees in 12 x research source for example if you have a degree in chemistry and research experience in biochemistry then tutoring in biochemistry would be a great option for you look for openings in related areas if you are struggling to find a need for tutors in your specialty you can branch out to closely related topics this opens up more opportunities for you to tutor and will enhance your skills on topics related to your specialty advertise yourself as a tutor in several different but closely related subjects if your specialty is biochemistry you could advertise yourself as a tutor in chemistry biology and biochemistry gauge what students need ultimately what you teach will be governed by what students need to learn if you are having difficulty finding students in need of your tutoring services ask some students what topics they need assistance in it may be outside your area of expertise but you could possibly still offer assistance many students need help in mathematics for example even though math is not in the title of a biochemistry major you will need to complete several chemistry courses that require relatively strong math skills to acquire your degree so offering assistance to students in basic math courses would not be out of the question compare job options different tutoring jobs come with different pay and benefit packages sometimes you can be hired as a tutor by the local board of education and be paid a set rate alternatively you could tutor as a private tutor and set your own schedule and rates tutoring agencies also offer a good way to connect with students and keep steady work go to school at the level that you wish to tutor many students choose to apply themselves as tutors in a class that they find enjoyable or easy they elect to tutor other students in that particular subject this is generally contained within a particular school or institution and is a good way for the tutoring student to make some extra money sometimes the tutor may not remain in the same school but will remain in the same district for example a high school student might tutor a middle school student in introductory science for example a student of one college or high school would rarely ever be a tutor at another take courses on the subjects that you want to tutor it is important that you understand the course that you are tutoring most places require that you have taken the course you wish to tutor usually you must have earned an a or better in the course sometimes a lower grade will be accepted if the professor recommends you sometimes you can tutor for a class that you tested out of for example introduction to chemistry complete tutor training most institutions have a specific training course that you must complete before being instated as tutor this is to ensure that you can properly communicate information to your fellow students after completing the training you will generally be listed in the institution s tutoring center where students will come for study help be aware of interactions with your students as a fellow student and a tutor your interactions with the people you tutor can sometimes be tricky you might often run into a student who doesn t recognize your authority on the subject because you are a student you should also recognize that to some degree you hold a position

student s assignment ask your tutee if they have an assignment sheet or rubric for whatever they re working on go over this sheet with the student so you have a good understanding of what the student needs help with 3 x research source some students might have a worksheet instead of an official assignment it ll likely depend on the specific subject that you re tutoring establish an overall goal for each tutoring session ask the tutee to explain what they ve been struggling with the most and try to center the session around that if you meet with a student regularly you may be able to make a small lesson plan for future sessions decide if you want to focus on a specific assignment or if your student would prefer to study a specific skill set 4 x research source for example if a student is struggling with an essay focus on the introductory paragraph instead of the entire paper if a student is really struggling with algebra you can walk them through specific skills instead of focusing on a homework assignment listen to the student s questions and concerns give the tutee plenty of opportunities to speak their mind especially if they have a question keep the session focused on the student so you can be as helpful as possible don t dominate the conversation with your own knowledge instead offer assistance and advice on an as needed basis 5 x research source eye contact is a great way to show that you re listening to a student ask tutees open ended questions instead of yes no questions phrase your questions in a way that forces your students to answer and engage with the material don t let your student answer with yes or no as these aren t good indicators of a student s understanding instead invite the tutee to explain the topic and information to you which gives them valuable practice 6 x research source instead of saying do you understand this topic you can ask something like can you explain how you solve this problem engage the tutee with questions throughout the session don t assume that the student completely understands a topic instead ask plenty of questions to check in and see how they re doing remind the student that you can always backtrack if a topic seems confusing 7 x research source get in the habit of checking in with your student every few minutes in the session you can say something encouraging like is everything making sense so far it s totally okay if you want to go over some of these topics again this subject can be really confusing think of multiple ways to explain a single concept 8 x expert source ronitte libedinsky ms academic tutor expert interview 26 may 2020 don t expect all students to learn and understand in the same way note that some tutees may be visual learners while others may prefer to have things explained brainstorm different ways to teach a single topic which helps ensure that your students really understand what s going on 9 x research source for instance some students may learn better with a venn diagram while others may prefer a bulleted written list an auditory learner may benefit from a question and answer session while a visual learner may prefer you to write or draw out different examples 10 x research source a kinesthetic or hands on learner may learn better if you let them pace or walk around throughout the session greet your tutees before the session starts introduce yourself before the beginning of the session and invite the tutee to share their name as well offer a friendly greeting and some basic small talk to help the tutee feel a bit more comfortable 11 x research source for instance you can say something like hi i m jane and i ll be your chemistry tutor what s your name or thanks so much for stopping by how s your day going praise your tutees so they feel encouraged let your tutee know whenever they do a good job with something a simple good job or nice work can go a long way especially if a student isn t confident in their own abilities try to praise your tutee a lot during each session even if it s something small 12 x research source for instance if your tutee solves a single math problem correctly tell them that they did a good job consistent praise helps tutees get more confidence in their abilities let your tutee know if you aren t sure of an answer don t be hard on yourself if you aren t sure of an exact answer instead be honest and transparent with your student about your own limitations use a reference book or quick web search to get the answer to your tutee s question instead 13 x research source it s perfectly normal and okay to not have the answers to everything for example you can say something like i don t know the answer to that off the top of my head but i can look it up really quickly relate to the tutee so they don t feel overwhelmed remind the student that they re not the only person who s struggled with this topic before share a story from when you struggled with a specific topic or lesson honesty will only raise your credibility with your tutee and will help them feel more relaxed and at ease with their assignment 14 x research source for instance you can say something like i completely understand where you re coming from here i took a class where i was really confused and i had to meet with a tutor for extra help exercise patience if a student doesn t understand something take your tutoring sessions step by step even if it s going slower than you may like 15 x expert source ronitte libedinsky ms academic tutor expert interview 26 may 2020 work at the student s pace if they re stuck on a single problem and offer continuous encouragement if they don t understand something right away 16 x research source if you get frustrated the student may get discouraged remember that tutoring is for the student s gain and not for your own offer a more flexible schedule that caters to your tutee try to make your schedule as open and accommodating as possible let your tutees know that you re happy to work around their schedule and that your main goal is to help them succeed your students may feel more invested in their tutoring sessions if they know that their tutor is willing to help 17 x research source instead of listing your own hours ask the student what time slots work well for them try to work your tutoring schedule around the student give tutees moments of silence to figure out a problem don t be afraid of awkward silence in your session instead encourage your students to take some time to themselves to figure out a problem offer your support on the side then praise the student for their efforts 18 x research source for instance you can say something like i ll give you a couple minutes to finish up this problem let me know if you need any help work with the student instead of commandeering the assignment view your tutoring session as a set of training wheels on the bike you re helping a student get the hang of an assignment while helping them develop confidence and independence don t solve their problems and do their assignments for them as this won t teach your tutees anything accept that your sessions are a team effort where you offer support while the student leads the way 19 x research source some students may expect you to solve a problem for them in this case say something like let s go through an example together so you can solve this problem on your own center your lessons around your tutee s interests and learning style 20 x expert source ronitte libedinsky ms academic tutor expert interview 26 may 2020 try to gauge your student s interests as you begin the session if your tutee is an athlete try adding sports metaphors into your session if the student is a musician try making some musical connections 21 x

child this article is designed as an overview for physics tutoring not an instruction manual for each lesson definitely read up on physics education for children and lesson planning in addition to this article,ask the parents if it hasn t been made clear in their communications up to this point discuss the issues with them find out why they want to hire you and any particular issues talk to the kid don t ask them why they need tutoring directly they may become ashamed or angry be too shy or simply not be willing to tell you do talk about what they do and don t like about physics and their current teacher depending on the age and social maturity the child may be able to tell you what in particular they are struggling with be cautious here narrow it down physics is a huge field if the parent or child has already outlined difficulty areas this step has been done for you if not find age appropriate material something interest about physics is how you can explain phenomena in a very simple way or you get get way into the nitty gritty with complex math try looking at overviews of physics topics online for each age group keep it age appropriate and creative don t confine yourself to just theory talk when possible but be aware of particular assignments the child may have a few example topics appropriate for young children the big picture for gravity the earth is really massive so smaller objects get pulled towards it you can have fun dropping things and maybe talk about how gravity causes tides collisions this will have to be a very shallow overview but you can talk about elastic and inelastic collisions more dropping things you can drop clay on the ground and see it go splat and compare it to a bouncy ball also look at memory foam and balloons light this is a big one prisms rainbows filters all sorts of cool things here middle school children can handle more complex topics but without heavy math magnets and electricity fun projects like making engines from magnets and copper wire and a creating a battery with a potato are engaging and involve other topics as well energy and work can be incorporated well with magnets and electricity projects conservation of energy can be introduced in basic ways waves sound light talk about transverse waves and longitudinal it s a great opportunity to sneak in slinkies get more into things like frequency as well high school children are at age where math can play a more significant role be sure to find out what kind of math background they have high school kids are can handle surface introductions to most topics and much more in depth explorations to some of the topics listed above furthermore it s more likely that high school students will have homework that your tutoring sessions will be based off of plan the lessons once you have your specific topic and an idea of age appropriate depth for that topic you can begin planning motivate the beginning of the project with a brief discussion of a phenomena it explains like rainbows for light or car engines for work ask the child questions and work from their responses determine the child s attention span and plan your cool stuff demos accordingly both in terms of frequency between theory and in length of project if the child has a long attention span they can build things themselves if not they may need to be shown the completed demo and be allowed to explore it or take part in only the last few steps of its creation read up on lesson planning in general see related wikihow articles and be flexible the amount of time to grasp a topic can vary greatly part of the point of a tutor is provide personalized attention if you are tutoring for a class try to keep on track with the class schedule you may be helping with individual homework assignments which can limit your autonomy in planning be constantly receptive to feedback check in with the parent pay attention to the child s responses and if you are tutoring for a class ask if you can see the class assessments like homework and tests come prepared if you are working from homework assignments make sure you are up on the topic being covered if you are teaching more generally make sure you ve planned the lesson always check that you have any supplies you might need but not too prepared you absolutely need to be flexible in tutoring you are not a typical teacher you are providing tailored sessions for your student if the student s teacher changed his her lesson plan or the student has a pressing need you may have to change topics unexpectedly communicate and question your job isn t just to lecture at the kid you want to engage him her when you are giving long explanations check in with the child and ask questions that provoke involvement hopefully this has given you a starting place for your tutoring don t forget that the internet is a fantastic resource for innovative experiments and sample lesson plans,Education-and-Communications
how to tutor a student who is failing,if you are a teacher or just a smart person no doubt someone has asked you at one time or another to please help their son daughter niece or nephew who is failing in school maybe you felt like you were not qualified or didn t have the time to take on someone needing that much help yet provided you are willing tutoring a failing student back to success can be a very rewarding and fruitful experience the spare time will find itself,figure out when you have at least 30 minutes or better an hour to spend with the student the first session will be the longest as it is a kind of getting to know session you need to ask probing questions and listen carefully to the responses some ways to ask questions and respond include so your mom tells me your are failing math or whatever subject s how badly are you failing tell me the reasons you think you are failing it s okay if you think you are the reason just tell me what you are doing to fail and we can work on that together you are probably not stupid you may learn in different ways but i find that students are rarely stupid really we will work to find the ways you learn best how do you think you learn best assess needs the goal of the first session is to find out what the student needs to work on and learn but more importantly to let the student know that you are his her support he or she does not have to bear the entire burden alone anymore you are here as an expert to direct the process so that he or she can work his her way out of this failing predicament this will immediately give confidence to the student the first session involves a lot of important psychological work that you will build on ways to assess the student include through examination or perhaps by doing a quick interview with the parents of the child or a look at their previous results aim to fix any major gaps for example a child is doing maths and is fabulous at algebra but has trouble remembering his or her timetables make sure you nail the timetables into their system many a source of failure can be pinpointed on a failure to grasp a key underpinning at some point during the studies set goals that focus on the gaps then proceed to goals that focus on the future end the first session by modeling how the student should do the next assignment then make sure the student can do it on their own before leaving give the student positive verbal commendation of their good work in this session and thank them for being honest with you continue goals assessment the goal of the second and remaining tutorial sessions is to make sure the student is progressing in a positive direction by doing homework making better grades on tests and feeling more in control of the subject every student will be different as to how much autonomy they have over their life and schoolwork you have to work with them according to their developmental pace not yours otherwise they will improve to please you not to help themselves this is very sensitive work and you must keep giving the ownership of the work to them you are only there to support and help them do the work modeling is always appropriate when they forget or a new concept is taught just make sure they need it always be honest and expect them to be honest with you about everything you will find the relationship very rewarding push the student towards his or her goal extend the student and create an expectation for the student to start doing this for him or herself the sooner this is internalized the better able the student will become at self disciplining the learning process and doing well test the learning and goal achievement prepare revision points to help go back over materials already covered do an end of term exam to see whether there has been any improvement determine compensation what to charge you have to check around your community to see what other tutors charge and then consider your qualifications keep a record of what the student has already learned with you keep a copy of the expected goals,Education-and-Communications

how to enjoy a spoiled plot book,if you re avoiding reading a book because everyone s already talked about it and the plot has been blogged to bits you might want to think again reading a book where you already know the plot can still be a personally enjoyable experience if you can accept that the plot spoiler isn t the be all and end all of the book this article will provide you with a number of ways to work around a spoiled plot so that you can still enjoy the actual read on your own terms,understand what a spoiler is and why it occurs in terms of a book a spoiler is something that reveals critical elements of the plot and often includes the ending it will usually be parts of a book that would otherwise be surprising for the reader 1 x research source reasons for a spoiler might include reviewing the book and critiquing it excitement of a reader who wants to share his or her appreciation of or annoyance with the book with others naïveté of a reader who doesn t believe it will spoil another person s reading of the book or doesn t realize that you haven t yet read the book a spoilsport who wants to ruin someone else s experience of the book perhaps someone showing off or just being mean spirited start reading part of the problem may well be that you simply won t start the book because a voice in your head keeps insisting that it s not worth the effort stop listening to that voice start reading and let your reaction to the first chapter or so be the real test of whether or not you want to continue reading chances are if the book is good you will be compelled to keep reading even though you know the plot or a key element expect to enjoy the book since it s clearly already popular and well talked about there will be a lot to enjoy throughout the book and it s important to keep in mind that books can still be enjoyed even if you know how it ends or know the big twist you already know what happened but you can still probably read to figure out why and how it happened and no matter how much you have already heard it won t ever be possible to truly grasp the manner in which the book is written and how it comes across in tone and narrative until you are personally reading it there will be plenty of parts of the book that you won t yet know spoilers are about the most popular surprising parts of the book they aren t the whole book and indeed there may be parts that resonate a great deal more with you than the spoiled parts but you won t know until you ve read it for yourself expect the funny parts to be original spoilers often don t convey the funnier parts of a book well because these are not the surprising twists in the book and it s actually very hard to convey the precise humor out of a book in a review or by recounting you kind of have to be there to get it be skeptical about the spoilers that you think you already know try not to overthink what you ve already been told or your expected reading experience you might have heard or read a lot of opinions about the plot but that doesn t mean they are either right or representative of what will be your own experience in fact you can have a lot of fun reading and thinking about other people s takes on the plot you might find yourself scoffing whoa joe was so wrong about that interpretation of what character x does in this scene what a load of rot what really happens is x y and z consider these points it s possible the person retelling the story doesn t understand the narrative elements or misunderstands the psychological underpinnings and misconstrues what really is going on narrative devices are not always clearly conveyed by spoilers for example you might know about the ending precisely because the author begins at the end and then unfolds the plot as to how the story reaches that ending a reverse chronology or it might be a case that the story begins in the middle in media res and the flashbacks leading up to that point are poorly conveyed by the spoiler and the spoilers may not have revealed the delightful red herrings strewn throughout the book there are many narrative devices that won t be fully appreciable until you delve into the book yourself in spite of spoilers savor surprises there still might be something not major in the plot that surprises you that hasn t been discussed or reviewed focus on the subjective elements that are in the realm of the reader s interpretation not that of the reviewer for this you would do well to look for such narrative devices as macguffins a prime motivation for a reader that is never adequately explained to the reader flashbacks and flash forwards prophecies foreshadowing etc all of these elements are for your own exploration for a deeper understanding to be interpreted through your own experience of life and feelings for the characters you might be pleasantly surprised at how much you differ in opinion about the rationales and outcomes of the book that other people have presumed to be a certain way don t anticipate the spoiled element coming up or try to predict when it will happen maybe the spoiler wasn t even true then you will be twice as surprised relish the fact you know the ending but not the how a common narrative device in plays such as those by shakespeare or movies that begin with the end you know the ending but you re a lot less certain of how the characters and story get to that ending keep in mind that movie plots and book plots frequently diverge and vary in depth if you have seen a movie version of a book before reading the book there is even less reason to fret about a spoiled plot movies simply do not have the luxury of being able to go into the same level of depth as a book so while you may have the general gist from a movie there are likely to be a lot of surprises and revelations for you when reading the book some of the things that might happen include a deeper understanding of what has motivated characters perhaps you have wondered why a movie character has been so one dimensional the book read might prove otherwise a different ending from what you expected movies often change endings for hollywood preferences additional characters scenes action etc that the movie didn t have room for of especial interest are those characters that get the chop in the movie but are of added interest in the book be someone who loves spoilers there are people who thrive on spoilers as a way to inform them before they start reading as a form of incentive 2 x research source knowing what the ending is and how the plot unfurls can sometimes be a way of avoiding unpleasant surprises or be a form of motivating your reading there are various websites devoted to spoilers which provide a discussion point for people who like spoilers which can be a reason of itself to enjoy spoilers as you get to argue the finer points or even veracity of spoilers with others online avoid times when you might be confronted by spoilers there are some occasions when you re more likely to be exposed to spoilers than normal book club meet ups always expect at least one person to have already read the book and to be ready to spill the beans book reviews whether or not a book review will reveal the plot will depend on the purpose for which it is being written if it is for promoting the book s sales and readership it is unlikely to give away the plot and ending if however it is for the purpose of critiquing the book often the case in blogs it may well reveal the ending and major plot elements you will need to judge according to the context of the review before reading further many reviewers will use the phrase spoiler alert if they are about to reveal major elements of the plot or ending you have been warned websites reader reviews forums blog posts you see someone with a copy of the book and they re talking about just having finished it let them know quickly that you don t want to know the ending don t go looking for spoilers online 3 x research source while there are many opportunities to find out what a book s contents are if you have the slightest peek at spoiler sites or reviews you only have yourself to blame remember that no spoiler can ruin a truly great book many avid readers will confess that they have read a number of books over and over and enjoyed them more with each subsequent reading books are stories and sometimes you need time to ruminate or meditate on the story the way it was told how it ties in to other stories think titanic the movie was based on an event almost a century prior to when the movie was made everyone knew how it had to end and yet it was one of the most popular movies of all time no spoiler will ever make reading a great story pointless another recent example an episode of doctor who featured vincent van gogh everyone knows who van gogh was and most know that he took his own life at a young age yet the story was widely considered one of the best of this series ever because it wasn t about van gogh s death it was about his life and it tied into a previous episode in which a regular character leaves the earthly plane it was about seeing beauty and feeling inadequate despite having tremendous talent and also about the importance in each of our lives of leaving a legacy and being remembered after we die a great story is a great story whether you know what happens in the end or not old yeller most people know possible spoiler alert that old yeller the dog dies but that doesn t mean it s not beautifully written classic,Education-and-Communications

to rest please get back to me within the next two weeks and let me know your plans you may get a response back that is less than helpful they may blatantly refuse or they may ignore your letter in that case you may want to talk to an attorney and send a more formal letter notify the site s dmca agent u s law requires web hosts such as wordpress and tumblr to have a dmca agent who can be

quote and cite a book the right way,be clear why you are using a quotation a quotation should provide a new point of view or bolster a point you are trying to make elaborate on the quoted text provide context and explain why it supports your argument 1 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source quotations are often used to support ideas that might be disputed or are not common knowledge an idea like most people never live to see 100 doesn t need to be backed up by a quotation but something like many writers have described the power of fiction should probably be supported with quotations one can sometimes emphasize a particular point by backing it up with a quotation from a particularly impressive author quotations can also add stylistic flare to your prose for example a sentence like when shakespeare shuffled off this mortal coil he likely had no idea the impact his work would make on western culture is a bit more interesting than if the same sentence started simply when shakespeare died work them into your text so they read like normal sentences to do this you will usually use a signal phrase like according to the author or something to that effect thus nick caraway describes humans as boats against the current works while nick caraway has a sad view of people boats against the current does not 2 x research source if you are having trouble deciding if you ve incorporated a quotation correctly try reading it aloud to yourself it can be easier to tell if a sentence works when you speak it some examples of verbs used in signal phrases are claims adds writes argues asserts confirms points out admits concludes observes and implies 3 x research source use brackets and ellipses to add or subtract words sometimes a quotation will support your argument perfectly but be impossible to work into your text without making changes in such cases you will need to use brackets or ellipses 4 x research source insert new words into quotations by putting them inside brackets remove existing words by replacing them with an ellipsis note that this is only appropriate if you maintain the basic meaning of the quotation it should not be used to twist an author s words into something other than what she intended as an example one could change the nabokov quotation art not an escape which is only a cleaner cell on a quieter floor but relief from the itch of being into the sentence art is not an escape but relief from the itch of being insert short quotations into the body of the paragraph a quotation shorter than four lines of prose or three lines of verse does not need to be its own

how to tell the edition of a book,whether you re a book collector searching for a first edition or you re a student looking for the most recent copy of a textbook finding out which edition of a book you have is crucial while most publishers will lay out the information for you it may still be tricky to find by examining your book carefully you ll be able to tell which edition of a book you possess,look for text that states the edition of the book sometimes the publisher will clearly write which edition of the book you have on the bottom of the copyright page look for the phrase first edition followed by the year if you re lucky the copyright page will list the years each edition was released 1 x research source if the publisher of the book has changed since it was first released the edition number is reset this means there could technically be two or more first editions of the same book a true first edition of a book is the first time the text was published in the first printing run of the book check the year the book was copyrighted versus when it was published find the phrase text copyright at the top of the page if the copyright year and the year of publication is the same it is likely that you have a first edition of the book if they are different you will know you have a later edition of the book 2 x research source the dates may differ on a first edition if the copyright was acquired at a different time than the publishing 3 x research source if edits have been made to the text of the book there may be multiple years listed under the copyright date always use the most recent year as your basis of judgement use the number line to determine the printing the number line near the bottom of the page doesn t necessarily determine the edition but it tells you how many times the book has been printed if there is a 1 still present in the number line it is the first print of the book from the publisher as more runs are printed the lowest number in the line will determine what printing you have 4 x research source the numbers may be in numerical order or they may be in no discernible order always look for the lowest number sometimes the printing year is also included in the line denoted by the last 2 digits of the year for example the number line may read 1 2 3 4 5 00 99 98 97 96 this book would then be the 1st print in 1996 research the differences between editions of the book usually the edition will only change if the content inside of the book has changed if there s a line added or removed from the dust jacket or a new passage is put in it could signal the book is an updated edition many websites will list what the differences are between the editions 5 x research source for non fiction books new information or studies may be added in newer editions to keep the information current and clear 6 x research source check the dust jacket to see if your book is a book club edition book club editions are books produced specifically for book of the month clubs or similar services inside the dust jacket instead of a price it will either read book club edition or have a 5 digit code for identification 7 x research source book club editions may leave the area that normally has a barcode blank as well determine if the isbn is for a limited edition the international standard book number or isbn is a unique 10 or 13 digit number to notate an edition or variation of a book while a limited edition copy of a book is usually noted on the cover or copyright page you can check the isbn listed above the barcode search the isbn online or compare it to the ones listed on the copyright page 8 x research source the same book can have multiple isbns depending on if it s released in hardcover paperback or a limited edition style,Education-and-Communications
how to analyze a book,reading books whether they be fiction or nonfiction is a terrific pastime that is both fun and informative however analyzing books can help you get even more out of the books you read both for fun and for academic purposes knowing how to analyze a book changes the way you interpret and understand books and maybe even what they mean to you once you know how to break down a work s plot structure language and argument while critiquing an author s perspective analyzing books is a breeze,read the work slowly and pay close attention to detail to analyze a book for its subtle messages and ideas you ll need to give the book your undivided attention take your time as you re reading and pay attention to all details the author chooses to include in the text 1 x research source remember when you re reading that all the little details in the book were deliberately chosen by the author and hence might be significant in some unseen way for example if an author describes a young girl s dress as yellow like the sun ask yourself why the author chose the color yellow symbol of optimism or what it means for her dress to be compared to the sun certain sections of any book should be read with particular attention the beginning and end for example are a good place to find meaning and symbolism in a text read these with a bit more attention if you have trouble reading slowly or staying focused try to keep the specific goal for your reading in mind instead of reading mindlessly for instance if you re trying to analyze a work of fiction for symbolism keep this in mind as you read and it will help you to zero in on the relevant details e g the author s choice of names for their characters 2 x research source read the book twice if you have time take notes as you read this will not only help you to note any details that appear to be significant but will also allow you to jot down your thoughts as you read and keep them organized include page numbers and chapter numbers in your notes 3 x research source write down anything you think might be particularly important even if you aren t sure you ll be glad you kept a convenient record of potentially significant details when it comes time to write about your analysis in your notes quote directly from the book when you think the specific wording of the text is important otherwise feel free to paraphrase the text when you re taking note of events or themes if you can invest in a personal copy of the text this lets you highlight underline and make notes in the margins of significant passages as you go study the context in which the author wrote the book the work might be a commentary on events going on in the author s life or be reflective of biases held by people in the author s society knowing the context of the book may also help you determine what the author s goal was in writing it 4 x research source when researching the context in which a book was written consider the time period location country state city etc political system and the biography of the author for example a russian expat writing in the 1940s about a dictatorship may be making a statement on the soviet union or joseph stalin look into other books by the same author and see how the book you re reading compares to them in terms of story subject matter themes and other details for example many of philip k dick s novels focused on the nature of reality and questions surrounding identity try starting on a site like wikipedia while it s not an academic source it often provides an overview of the topic and may link to other sources or even other works by the author establish the essential plot points of the story the plot of a novel is typically organized around a certain pattern which includes a problem a climax and a resolution identify where these points occur in the story to better understand what message the author is trying to get across 5 x research source for example if the characters in a novel are only able to resolve a problem by working together the author may be making a statement on the importance of collaboration determine the setting of the book and how it contributes to the story although the setting of a novel can seem like background it s often as important to the story as some of the characters consider how the setting of the story influences your reaction to it or helps convey the story s theme 6 x research source settings can be symbolic reflect on the characters at a certain point in their journey and or foreshadow certain key plot elements for example ask yourself if a story that takes place in an isolated cabin during winter would be significantly different if it took place in an apartment in a big city if so think about why a different setting changes the meaning of the story examine the actions motivations and beliefs of the characters books typically have a main character the protagonist a villain the antagonist and an assortment of secondary characters while reading think about why the characters do what they do and what this says about them and their beliefs 7 x research source you should also consider why the author would have their characters do the things they do and what point they re trying to make for example if a holy man commits a murder ask yourself why the character would betray his beliefs or why the author would seek to depict a holy man in this way consider how the author s writing style affects the book s story although an author s writing style may be the result of personal preference it could also be an intentional stylistic choice to influence a reader s reaction to the story pay attention to the author s style and ask yourself if it influences the story s meaning 8 x research source writing style includes the author s choice of vocabulary sentence structure tone imagery symbolism and overall feeling of the story 9 x research source for example an author may seek to impart a more humorous tone by using short choppy sentences and nonsensical words identify the book s principal theme or message most authors who write a work of fiction will have a theme or message that they want their book to convey use your analysis of the plot setting characters and writing style to determine what the book s theme is some common themes include good vs evil growing up human nature love friendship war and religion 10 x research source a book may deal with multiple themes with some themes being more obvious than others often themes are most visible in the beginning and end of a book re read these sections after your first read through to help you evaluate the book s theme make an outline to put your ideas and relevant information together this is especially useful if you re writing a critical analysis of a book for others to read create an outline that includes background information about the book and author a summary or description of the work itself and your interpretation 11 x research source read the book slowly and take notes as you read non fiction books are often dense and can be dry to read make sure you read slowly and stay focused so you don t lose track of the book s logical flow jot down your thoughts on the book or the more important information you come across try to find key words and phrases in each paragraph as you read and write down a summary of each passage or chapter as you go 12 x research source if you have trouble reading slowly or staying focused try to keep the specific goal for your reading in mind instead of reading mindlessly if you re reading for specific information on a topic e g the physical properties of meteorites bear this in mind as you read and you will be better able to focus on the relevant information as you read it determine the author s purpose every non fiction book has a purpose whether it be to describe persuade argue or instruct skim over the text and if possible read the book s summary to discern what the author s goal is 13 x research source for example some historians write books to challenge dominant interpretations of certain historical events e g the cause of the american civil war many authors will state the purpose of their non fiction book in the preface or introductory chapter and restate that purpose in the book s concluding chapter skim these sections to help you determine the book s overall goals research the author s background and motivation for writing this book compare the book to other works that the author has written and ask yourself if the author s beliefs or ideologies may result in the book being biased 14 x research source for example if the book is a history of a particular political party then the author s relationship to that party e g if the author is a party member will almost certainly influence how the party s history is written in the book distinguish facts from statements of opinion although the factual evidence used to bolster an argument should be viewed critically it is the author s opinion that you should critique and evaluate in your analysis 15 x research source for example an author may write high school students typically learn european history from their teachers these teachers are overpaid in this instance the first sentence is a statement of fact while the second is a statement of opinion statements of fact are often followed by citations either in the form of footnotes or parenthetical citations don t dismiss out of hand what an author says purely because it s opinion in most cases an author s conclusions will be derived from the facts that are also presented in the book and should be judged as such examine the evidence the author relies on to support their argument determine whether the evidence the author presents actually supports their conclusions or persuades you to agree with their opinion similarly consider whether the author has intentionally left out any evidence that contradicts their argument due to their own bias 16 x research source for example consider whether you would reach a different conclusion based on the same evidence and check to see if the author describes in the book why they didn t reach the same conclusion as you if they don t their argument may not be entirely thought out try to check the author s information against other sources look at academic articles online encyclopedias and other scholarly resources to see if the evidence the author cites matches the larger scholarly body of work on the subject or if you can find contradictory evidence that the author did not include in their work decide whether the book accomplishes its purpose ask yourself if you ve been convinced by the book to agree with the author s opinion argument or conclusions if you were not persuaded determine what about the book failed to convince you of the author s correctness 17 x research source for instance think about whether the author s evidence was reliable or relevant whether the argument was logical and whether the author s conclusions made sense to you be sure to not let your personal attitudes interfere with your analysis if you find a book unconvincing ask yourself if you have any internal biases that may prevent you from analyzing the book in a neutral manner,Education-and-Communications

book as a gift with a note to the recipient is also a great way to commemorate a special occasion and add a personal touch to the gift remember that your signature will last as long as the book does so take care with your autograph and message,come up with a unique and legible author s signature if your regular signature is not legible or interesting you should come up with a new one to sign your books with you want people to be able to tell who signed the book it could be worth something someday 1 x research source make sure your signature includes both your first and last name look at some examples of calligraphy online or in a book of fonts to find a style you like 2 x research source practice your new signature until you can do it without thinking you should be able to autograph with your new signature quickly and consistently without too much effort start by practicing just the capital letters until you have them down then practice signing the whole signature over and over again 3 x research source practicing your signature is key to get your hand used to the new style so that when it comes time to sign multiple books you can do it quickly like a pro practice in your spare time on a blank notepad until you perfect it 4 x research source use a good quality pen with blue or black ink choose a pen that you are comfortable signing with repeatedly and buy a few of them for when you inevitably run out of ink a good option for book signing is a calligraphy pen or fine tipped felt pen such as a sharpie but it s totally up to you and your preference 5 x research source make sure the ink of whatever pen you choose dries quickly so it does not smear on the page of the book sign your book on the title page or the blank page opposite the title these are the most common places for an author to sign a book a less common place to sign is inside the front cover 6 x research source where you sign the book is completely up to you and your personal preference when it comes to the value of the book the only thing that matters is that it is signed not where the signature is located ask readers for information you can use to write a personal message start with asking their name and remember to double check the spelling if you have time to chat try to get some more information that you could include such as what they liked about your book or who their favorite character was 7 x research source ask the reader if they would like you to sign the book to them or to someone else in case they are planning on giving it as a gift if you learned a reader is going into 7th

place when they crack open your book 8 x research source the more specific and personal your message is the more special your book will be to the recipient create at least one signature phrase or catchphrase to use it s good to have something ready to go in case you don t have enough information to fully personalize a message this way you can still make your signature unique and special 9 x research source you can vary your message with different phrases such as best wishes much appreciation all the best thanks for reading and other well wishes such as these if you ever end up doing a large book signing event then having these phrases ready to go will help you save time don t sign a book that is a first edition or may be collectable one day unless you are the author or in some way associated with the production of the book you should not sign anything that may be valuable one day as this will detract from the value in this case you could include a signed card with the book instead 10 x research source if you are the author of the book or someone closely associated such as an editor feel free to sign it as this will increase the value and make your gift that much more special if you are not sure how to determine if a book could be valuable check the page with the publishing information to see what edition it is generally first editions are the most valuable if the book is a special edition or part of a special collection it may also be valuable one day sign the book on the first blank page of paper facing the front cover other common options include the title page or the blank piece of paper facing the title page just make sure you will have enough room for the amount you plan on writing 11 x research source write a personal message with your signature think about the occasion of the gift you are giving or your connection to the recipient and personalize a message that they can cherish forever include some personal thoughts and feelings with your message 12 x research source you can look online to see some examples of personalized message for specific occasions such as baby showers or birthdays if you are not sure what to write practice what you will write on a piece of paper before signing the book once you sign the book you will not be able to change it easily so make sure you have practiced your signature and message first it won t be a pretty gift if you have to scratch something out because of a mistake when you actually sign the book 13 x research source use a good pen with black or blue ink and sign the book with your message it is up to you whether to use a thin or thick pen just be sure to choose something you are comfortable with and that will look nice sign the book and make sure that the ink dries before you close it and gift wrap it 14 x research source a good quality calligraphy pen or fine tipped felt pen is a good option for book signing an alternative to signing a book as a gift is to include an inscribed bookmark with it that way they can use it and enjoy your message with future books they read,Education-and-Communications

how to determine the genre of a book,when a reader looks for a new author to read he or she usually browses books in genres they enjoy whether you re describing your own work or shelving a book at a library the right genre will help readers find what they seek,list possible genres for the work assuming the book is already complete you can narrow it down to a subset of possible genres list anything that could plausibly describe a part of the book even if you think that romance or action are relatively minor components if you re not trying to market a book or you need help with genre definitions skip down to the next section look up similar books online if you don t feel confident about your list of possible genres look up works you ve read that are similar to the book you re marketing if several of them are listed under the same genre chances are your book will fit under that category as well conversely if none of the books under mystery sound remotely similar to your book it s probably a bad fit track these genres on amazon most fiction is sold through amazon so its top seller lists provide important information 1 x research source although publishers conduct more complex analysis anyone can conduct one test quickly for each genre compare the top seller lists each week for several weeks if the same books stay in the top 10 for a long time the genre is slow moving this usually means there s less competition but you ll be fighting for a smaller readership if the list changes rapidly that genre is fast moving it will take more effort to compete but the rewards potential sales are higher compare genre advertising fees a roundabout but effective way to compare genre success is through advertising fees web pages such as bookbub advertising prices and kindle nation sponsorship tell you how much various sites value different genres genres with higher costs tend to have more competition but larger readership for those who rise above the rest bookbub s stats in particular give you excellent information if you plan to pay for advertising compare the cost of a featured deal and the effect of the deal additional downloads sales to see which genre gives the best bang for your buck ask for input you have some more information now and may be able to narrow it down to a smaller list ask an editor publisher agent or close friend for their input on the decision consider the target audience different genres have audiences with different demographics most readers will assume a romance novel is written for adults while fantasy novels are more attractive to young adults when you re deciding between genres choose one with a main audience you think will enjoy the book if your target audience is not the same as a typical book in your genre s clarify with an additional description for example write young adult mystery or literary science fiction choose two or three genres if reasonable most websites allow you to pick more than one genre to describe a book it s often best to allow your book to compete in multiple genres or subgenres such as science fiction horror or war thriller learn the main realist fiction genres genre is probably most important for fiction as many readers use it to discover works they may enjoy we ll start with realist fiction genres or stories that are imaginary but theoretically possible 2 x research source crime has many overlapping subcategories including mystery suspense and the action oriented thrillers romance focuses primarily on a love story and may or may not be erotic as well this can stand alone or be combined with other genres usually historical or paranormal fiction historical fiction can be set at any point in the past large libraries categorize it further by specific times and places the western is a popular subgenre with its own tropes action or adventure describe fast paced tales of danger and exploration it often includes elements from non realistic fiction but this isn t fundamental to the genre categorize speculative fiction these stories could not happen in the real world in the present or past the exact sub categories are difficult to define as there is a huge amount of overlap and experimentation here s how they re most commonly arranged but don t be surprised if one book could fit into two or three of the following 3 x research source science fiction tends to focus more on ideas than plot it s often set in the future or in space and attributes unusual phenomena to science which may or may not be plausible fantasy includes magical or supernatural

reading even though you know the plot or a key element expect to enjoy the book since it s clearly already popular and well talked about there will be a lot to enjoy throughout the book and it s important to keep in mind that books can still be enjoyed even if you know how it ends or know the big twist you already know what happened but you can still probably read to figure out why and how it happened and no matter how much you have already heard it won t ever be possible to truly grasp the manner in which the book is written and how it comes across in tone and narrative until you are personally reading it there will be plenty of parts of the book that you won t yet know spoilers are about the most popular surprising parts of the book they aren t the whole book and indeed there may be parts that resonate a great deal more with you than the spoiled parts but you won t know until you ve read it for yourself expect the funny parts to be original spoilers often don t convey the funnier parts of a book well because these are not the surprising twists in the book and it s actually very hard to convey the precise humor out of a book in a review or by recounting you kind of have to be there to get it be skeptical about the spoilers that you think you already know try not to overthink what you ve already been told or your expected reading experience you might have heard or read a lot of opinions about the plot but that doesn t mean they are either right or representative of what will be your own experience in fact you can have a lot of fun reading and thinking about other people s takes on the plot you might find yourself scoffing whoa joe was so wrong about that interpretation of what character x does in this scene what a load of rot what really happens is x y and z consider these points it s possible the person retelling the story doesn t understand the narrative elements or misunderstands the psychological underpinnings and misconstrues what really is going on narrative devices are not always clearly conveyed by spoilers for example you might know about the ending precisely because the author begins at the end and then unfolds the plot as to how the story reaches that ending a reverse chronology or it might be a case that the story begins in the middle in media res and the flashbacks leading up to that point are poorly conveyed by the spoiler and the spoilers may not have revealed the delightful red herrings strewn throughout the book there are many narrative devices that won t be fully appreciable until you delve into the book yourself in spite of spoilers savor surprises there still might be something not major in the plot that surprises you that hasn t been discussed or reviewed focus on the subjective elements that are in the realm of the reader s interpretation not that of the reviewer for this you would do well to look for such narrative devices as macguffins a prime motivation for a reader that is never adequately explained to the reader flashbacks and flash forwards prophecies foreshadowing etc all of these elements are for your own exploration for a deeper understanding to be interpreted through your own experience of life and feelings for the characters you might be pleasantly surprised at how much you differ in opinion about the rationales and outcomes of the book that other people have presumed to be a certain way don t anticipate the spoiled element coming up or try to predict when it will happen maybe the spoiler wasn t even true then you will be twice as surprised relish the fact you know the ending but not the how a common narrative device in plays such as those by shakespeare or movies that begin with the end you know the ending but you re a lot less certain of how the characters and story get to that ending keep in mind that movie plots and book plots frequently diverge and vary in depth if you have seen a movie version of a book before reading the book there is even less reason to fret about a spoiled plot movies simply do not have the luxury of being able to go into the same level of depth as a book so while you may have the general gist from a movie there are likely to be a lot of surprises and revelations for you when reading the book some of the things that might happen include a deeper understanding of what has motivated characters perhaps you have wondered why a movie character has been so one dimensional the book read might prove otherwise a different ending from what you expected movies often change endings for hollywood preferences additional characters scenes action etc that the movie didn t have room for of especial interest are those characters that get the chop in the movie but are of added interest in the book be someone who loves spoilers there are people who thrive on spoilers as a way to inform them before they start reading as a form of incentive 2 x research source knowing what the ending is and how the plot unfurls can sometimes be a way of avoiding unpleasant surprises or be a form of motivating your reading there are various websites devoted to spoilers which provide a discussion point for people who like spoilers which can be a reason of itself to enjoy spoilers as you get to argue the finer points or even veracity of spoilers with others online avoid times when you might be confronted by spoilers there are some occasions when you re more likely to be exposed to spoilers than normal book club meet ups always expect at least one person to have already read the book and to be ready to spill the beans book reviews whether or not a book review will reveal the plot will depend on the purpose for which it is being written if it is for promoting the book s sales and readership it is unlikely to give away the plot and ending if however it is for the purpose of critiquing the book often the case in blogs it may well reveal the ending and major plot elements you will need to judge according to the context of the review before reading further many reviewers will use the phrase spoiler alert if they are about to reveal major elements of the plot or ending you have been warned websites reader reviews forums blog posts you see someone with a copy of the book and they re talking about just having finished it let them know quickly that you don t want to know the ending don t go looking for spoilers online 3 x research source while there are many opportunities to find out what a book s contents are if you have the slightest peek at spoiler sites or reviews you only have yourself to blame remember that no spoiler can ruin a truly great book many avid readers will confess that they have read a number of books over and over and enjoyed them more with each subsequent reading books are stories and sometimes you need time to ruminate or meditate on the story the way it was told how it ties in to other stories think titanic the movie was based on an event almost a century prior to when the movie was made everyone knew how it had to end and yet it was one of the most popular movies of all time no spoiler will ever make reading a great story pointless another recent example an episode of doctor who featured vincent van gogh everyone knows who van gogh was and most know that he took his own life at a young age yet the story was widely considered one of the best of this series ever because it wasn t about van gogh s death it was about his life and it tied into a previous episode in which a regular character leaves the earthly plane it was about seeing beauty and feeling inadequate despite having tremendous talent and also about the importance in each of our lives of leaving a legacy and being remembered after we die a great story is a great story whether you know what happens in the end or not old yeller most people know possible spoiler alert that old yeller the dog dies but that doesn t mean it s not beautifully written classic,Education-and-Communications

source if you are reading an article focus on the first and last paragraphs these areas are typically where authors will state and re state their arguments jot down any unfamiliar terms or concepts and come back to them later look for signposts signposts are words or phrases that indicate the author is saying something significant as you skim look for words like most essential definition and thesis depending on which discipline you are studying you might come up with your own set of signposts to look for 2 x research source read for 25 minutes then take a 5 minute break you might think that reading for as long as possible will help you get through that massive stack of books however it s actually better to break reading up in manageable chunks your brain can better process information that way 3 x research source set a timer for 25 minutes and read until it dings during this time don t check your phone look at email or do anything other than read after your 25 minute

are assigned 6 x research source the reviews will give you insight into what the book is about and what topics it covers you ll know what you re looking for when you begin to read the actual book make sure to read more than 1 review so that you don t just get 1 reviewer s opinion read the introduction conclusion and table of contents to find the argument you are reading for big ideas in graduate school not for every minute detail authors will generally introduce you to their argument in the introduction and reiterate it in the conclusion once you understand their main point you can usually skim the rest of the book to find examples that support that argument 7 x research source the table of contents lets you see how the book is organized and what topics are most important write down

the argument you can also write down important quotes just don t forget the page number some good questions might be 8 x research source what is the author s thesis what are some ways that they support their argument are the sources sound what could this book do better read the material more closely if time allows skimming and looking for the main points will likely be good enough to give you a decent understanding of the material but if this book is relevant and important to your own research take the time to go back and read the entire book or article you don t have to do this right away you can set it aside with a note to come back to it later set clear goals a great way to keep yourself on track is to set manageable goals assess your reading for the week and then figure out a

readings first you don t want to fall farther behind 12 x research source if you really find yourself in a jam talk to your professor explain your situation and ask for advice about which topic is most important to focus on that week work with your classmates your graduate school classmates can be one of your greatest resources either create or join a study group and figure out ways to help

equals by a majority of the characters despite the fact that there s no evidence that tom robinson actually raped or harmed mayella ewell he is convicted of the crimes because the jury believes a white man s word over a black man s which characters display racism which do not think about how good and evil play a part even in a small town like maycomb evil exists scout and jem learn that most people aren t wholly good or wholly evil everyone has the capability to be both and it is people s actions and choices that define them are there any characters that are wholly good any that are

social inequality in maycomb impacts the novel there are several social classes of white people but all black people are placed in a single social class below the whites think about how each class lives and behaves differently from the others and how each group s children are educated where are the finches in this class system the cunninghams the ewells the robinsons see the mockingbird as a representation of innocence as the title of the novel indicates to kill a mockingbird is a sin because mockingbirds are innocent creatures that do no harm there s never a reason to take one s life are

how to narrate an audiobook,the audiobook industry is a quick growing industry becoming a narrator for audiobooks can provide a great potential for money it takes very little to get started,purchase and set up professional equipment when starting out it is simple to create an in home studio all that is needed is a microphone editing software and headphones although the starting microphone that you purchase does not have to be the most expensive it does help with editing if you use a proper microphone you can purchase great professional sounding microphones for under a hundred dollars for editing software there are some free options available if you have an apple product garageband is free to download and is usually already pre installed on macbooks if not there are other free programs such as audacity headphones are very important when it comes to editing again these do not have to be the most expensive or tech savvy headphones when choosing headphones over the ear headphones create a safer experience especially when the editing process is a bit longer to reduce popping sounds recorded by the microphone a pop filter is a very inexpensive solution this can make the audio sound crisp sign up for free services such as audiobook creation exchange acx acx is audible s audiobook site for narrators authors and producers it is easy to sign up you can use your amazon account information since audible is an amazon company acx creates communication between authors and narrators the site is easy to use note that the rest of the instructions in this article are based around the acx interface other services may have similar steps with several differences set preferences and abilities while setting up an account this is important because if you speak and read in multiple languages acx will provide more options based on the languages you speak the preferences also provide options based on characters gender nationality etc you can also set preferences for which types or genre of books you like to read if you are interested in the book the more enjoyable the audiobook will be to listeners this will help you narrow down your search when looking for books ready for narration browse genres topics and audition for titles that you are interested in this process can take a while when you find something that you are interested in narrating you must submit an audition to the author the author will provide a short sampling of the book the sample can be a few lines to a few pages this is just like auditioning as an actor for a television show or film if there are multiple characters or emotions involved in the sample it is important that you adequately express them submit another recording after your audition is approved once your audition is approved by the author acx and the author will require you to submit another recording the material for the recording will be the first fifteen minutes of the book this gives the author the chance to decide whether the fit is right for the book in other words the author may give you some tips about the characters or ask you to keep certain ideas in mind when recording the rest of the chapters it is important that you take the author s notes into consideration with each recording receive the full version of the book once the author has reviewed and approved the first fifteen minutes of your narration they will provide you with the full version of the book they will also give you a date in which the full recording of the audiobook is due they typically allow two or three months in between the start date and the due date this is because there will be reviews and re recordings throughout the process chapters will be submitted individually at first and then collectively it is important to read the book ahead and make notes prior to recording each chapter this is important because there should be a variation of voices for the different characters if there is a line in the book that says we ran out of gas she exclaimed you will want to use a voice that implies exclamation when you read through and notate the chapters prior to recording you become more prepared for changes in character and mood narrate chapter by chapter when you begin to narrate the book you will narrate chapter by chapter in other words after you read and record each chapter you will edit and upload each chapter individually editing should be done using professional editing software this will allow the author to listen to each chapter individually and approve the chapters the better the quality the better the experience when editing be sure to have continuity between takes coughing and other noises should not be heard this is the purpose of editing expensive is not a synonym for professional there are many ways to edit these recordings without dropping a lot of money on software unless you find an editing software that you really enjoy working with it is important that you listen to your own work it is better to catch mistakes yourself than to have the author catch them try closing your eyes while listening to edits it helps with focusing on the sound of the audio clip rather than visuals on the computer screen receive feedback from the author once a chapter is uploaded the author will listen to the recording and provide or suggest any tips or changes to the recording if the author suggests changes to the recording it is best that you go back and make those changes to that recording before recording and editing the next chapter if they make suggestions to the portrayal of a character the same tips and changes may be crucial to the following chapters they may even ask for you to add sound effects that are central to the storyline it is important to take into account any changes that they suggest because they are the judge of the final product submit the full work to the author again once you have finished recording each chapter of the book you will submit the full work to the author again the website will allow the author to listen to each chapter with continuity this is an important process because the author is the first listener of your full recording it is important that you allow the author time to review this material their review will be hypercritical because they want their book presented properly the author will still have suggestions or requests after you have submitted the first draft of the full work receive additional feedback from the author once again the author will provide you with tips and changes to the recordings or edit in rare cases they will only have a few suggestions or requests for change it is important to follow their notes suggestions or requests for each recording this process may take several days the author will most likely listen to the recordings multiple times to ensure that the recordings are to their liking or to ensure that they are held to a certain quality their opinion is the most important to the success of your audiobook wait for an internal representative to review your work if the author approves your work it will be sent to audible for an internal representative to review the internal representative for acx will listen to the audiobook to ensure that it meets audible s standards the standards include being consistent in sound and quality including credits in the beginning and end of the audiobook a sample of 1 5 minutes for retail use etc the full list can be viewed at acx com find out when the book will be uploaded if the audiobook is approved by the internal representative the representative will contact you with the date the audiobook will be uploaded onto the audible platform this isn t the end of your process it is important that you market yourself and your new piece of work on all social media platforms the more you post about your work the more people will listen this is important because most audiobook jobs are paid based on how many recordings are sold paid on percentage also the more you market your work the more reviews and opportunities will present themselves,Education-and-Communications

how to make the most of self help books,self help books can change lives but many people don t get as much out of them as they could if you re one of those people this article is for you,know yourself to find a balance different people have different personalities some people read a lot and apply a little while some people read a little and apply all of it effectiveness lies in the balance balance says how much i can read and apply it immediately without losing something i read so try to find a balance remember again effectiveness lies in the balance read just enough that you can implement information in self help books cannot be digested like a novel so you ll get more out of them by focusing on some information a day and trying to digest that information before you go onto the next part if there are exercises along the way such as journaling or reflection try to do them on the day when you read the chapter that talks about them when the instructions and purpose are fresh in your mind pay attention to details try to find information and quotes from the book that can help you in your life these quotes can serve as motivation as you proceed do not simply read try to find the inner meanings of the information and understand its purpose be a student get a notepad before you start and write anything you find interesting into your notepad or get a highlighter and highlight all the main facts or information you find interesting in the book make a list to make the implementation process organized make a list consisting of things from the book to implement for example suppose you learned about the concept of making people important genuinely then you are more likely to succeed if you apply it right away without giving much time between getting the information and implementation of it read critically self help books contain advice and are therefore written for a general audience the authors do not know you personally or your situation as a simple example many excellent gardening books are written in vermont but the information and advice in them may be completely inappropriate for california s climate and soils here are some things to ask yourself as you read does the author have personal experience with this subject does the author have scientific or professional experience with this subject or has he she consulted the literature is the advice and experience recommended in the book relevant to your situation does the advice make sense and does it make sense in your own life how is the author motivated are they selling anything besides books if the book gives financial advice does the author use it him herself and does he she stand to gain from others following the advice is the book well regarded in the community why or why not how do other works in the same subject area compare do they take similar approaches speed of implementation most successful people are those who implement it as soon as they learn something this may sound like a cliché but the quicker you apply a concept after learning it the better you would be able to the grasp of it for example if you learn about dance move and if you tried it right away without much delay more quickly and easily you will learn it easily as compared to when you try to practice it after a delay act a car without an engine will not work similarly an idea without hard work will not work when you read self help books and develop a new idea work hard to make that idea reality lest it remain an idea be focused some people do not focus even when it is something that could change a life thus read in a peaceful environment as with any other book and give the information your full attention read at a time and in an environment that encourages you to stay awake do not neglect important information work in a group get a meeting place for your group and each time you meet up read a chapter of the book and discuss the information give a notepad and pencil and take turns sharing your thoughts check back with your group as you all implement the advice what worked what still needs work did you stick with the latest part of the plan a little accountability can really help you get going share if something which you learn you find good share it with your friends and relatives and people who would be interested this is not only a good thing to do but would also help you to grasp the concept better do a little at a time small steps add up to big results remember the tortoise and the hare the tortoise won the race because the hare became exhausted quickly for the tortoise to win the race there are a couple of things he needs to do stick his neck out and get going keep at it identify and follow the correct path reevaluate and correct so you started the program and you see yourself getting stuck or veering off course ask yourself why do you need to work harder do you need to work on smaller more manageable parts is there information you re still missing do you hate what you re doing if so is it because you re trying to accomplish something difficult such as quitting smoking or because what you re trying to do isn t right for you your group can help you sort out these

children examples of how to handle their own concerns and help them imagine ways to deal with them you can help a child through bibliotherapy through finding a good book to help them better understand their problem talking about the book and making connections in the child s life and perhaps even coming up with your own story to share with your child,identify the child s need determine the behavior or situation you want to address try to be as specific as you can about the issue in order to have a better chance of the book resonating with your child for example say your child is having problems in school think about the kinds of problems your child is having academic problems problems with a particular subject does your child struggle to pay attention in class does your child have a hard time making friends in school narrow your focus as much as possible consider the child s age and development how old is the child can the child read on their own the book you choose needs to be well matched to the child s age mental and emotional development and reading level in order for the child to follow and engage with the storyline 2 x research source for example a book geared toward a preschool child s school day would not connect with a fourth grade child s school day and vice versa even if a child is able to read independently you still may wish to find a read aloud book that you can share with them talk to your local children s librarian they can point you in the direction of age appropriate books pertaining to your topic 3 x research source if they do not have a certain book available many libraries will help you locate the book at another local library or may even order it for their collection for example you could ask your librarian my four year old is afraid of going to the doctor do you have any books that could help understand going to the doctor and help her feel better about it some libraries have kits or bags that can be checked out that pertain to a particular subject matter like death divorce or moving these kits often have books movies and other resources that could be helpful to your child look for book lists online you may try searching for lists of books that pertain to your topic like books on the loss of a pet for a five year old you may also try searching for book lists put together by bibliotherapists librarians or mental health professionals here are some sample lists teen mental health issues http www slj com 2014 11 teens ya bibliotherapy for teens helpful tips and recommended fiction _ dealing with emotions for babies and toddlers https www zerotothree org resources 7 books about feelings for babies and toddlers examine the book s storyline while you are deciding upon an appropriate book for the child you may want to skim the book and get a sense of what happens in the book things you may want to consider the child needs to be able to identify with a character dealing with the same problems and connect with them emotionally 4 x research source therefore if you have a choice you may wish to choose a book with a protagonist the same gender or age as your child determine if the book reflects the outcome you wish to see with the child look for a book with positive behavior changes and or evidence of the character s growth and understanding 5 x research source for example if you are looking for a book about moving you may want a book in which the character is sad to leave their ol home but makes new friends at their new school look for a book that appropriately expresses the emotional reality of the child for example while some children may be excited about moving and some books reflect this your child is anxious and sad look for a book which has a character struggling with the same emotions if the child is younger examine the book s illustrations to determine if they appropriately represent the text and the character s emotions ensure that the problem your child and the protagonist are facing is successfully resolved for example if you are looking for a book that addresses school performance make sure that the character shows how their studying and paying attention in class helped them earn a good grade 6 x research source read the story with the child present the book to the child when they are in a good mood and seem receptive to hearing about the concern set aside enough time afterwards so that you are able to discuss the story with the child 7 x research source try saying i got this book at the library today i thought it was neat because it was about making new friends do you want to read it with me if the child says no put the book down in a place where they can see it and try again later they might look at the pictures or try to read it on their own avoid bringing up the problem you re trying to address when you show them the book instead present it as a fun activity that you want to do together do not present the story to your child at a time of stress or immediately in the wake of the behavior you are trying to correct the child will be less receptive for an older child who reads on their own you could give them the book and say something like i was at the bookstore the other day and saw this book it reminded me of what we were talking about the other day maybe you d like to read it follow up with the child in a few days remain easygoing keep the mood light as you read the book you do not want to put pressure on the child to accept the book as a prescription for their problem rather you want to create a sense of excitement for example wow this character is going through the same thing you are i wonder what he does to figure it out talk about the problem through the character kids often feel better talking about problems secondhand it is easier to say look at the problem she is having she must be sad then to say dealing with this problem makes me sad talking about the issue through the book will help a child feel less defensive and vulnerable about their emotions 8 x research source ask questions about the character like why do you think the character behaved that way what do you think the character should do instead how did you think the character felt when that happened 9 x research source if you are reading the book to the child you could pause throughout the book to ask questions about what is happening this will help you gauge if the child is making connections to the text help the child realize they are not alone hopefully the child will be able to make the connection between their problem and the character s but you can also articulate this for them state that the child is not the only one who is dealing with the same issue and that there are many people who have the same concerns as the child this way you will normalize their problem and help them feel empowered to deal with it 10 x research source you could say do you see in this book that this boy was also afraid of going to the hospital that s very normal almost everybody gets nervous about going to the hospital give the child activities that connect with the book help the child bring the book to life by thinking more about the book or coming up with other ways to engage with it 11 x research source don t push it if the child doesn t seem interested but if the book resonated with the child you might consider suggesting that the child draw a picture about what the character does next or what the character could have done instead in the story having the child act out being the character in the book both at the beginning of the story the problem part and the end the resolution this can help the child connect the book to their own behavior doing an activity together that is inspired by the book for example maybe you read a book about the death of a grandparent and in the book the character memorializes their grandparent by making a scrapbook filled with memories suggest to the child that the two of you do the same or create another memorial the child would prefer consider writing your own story you might not be able to find a book that addresses the child s issues or you may not feel that the books available are appropriate to your child you may decide to create your own story about a child facing a similar problem you can decide if you want to write out the story and perhaps illustrate it or tell the story aloud to the child look for a bibliotherapy or writing group nearby where you can get support and assistance meetup com is a great place to start looking develop a story think of ways the child exhibits a particular behavior or deals with a certain situation common consequences to the child s actions and the outcome you would like to see describe the child s current behavior or situation at the beginning of the story have the child engage in this behavior and then receive consequences for their actions or the child is exposed to a new situation and doesn t know how to handle it describe the character s reaction to the situation for example when sally the bunny was teased on the playground her ears drooped and she got very quiet or even though the teacher had already told him to raise his hand johnny couldn t resist shouting out the answer again the teacher told johnny to stay after school the child should be able to relate to the main character s crisis in the story enter a character like parent teacher or someone older and respected this character connects with the protagonist and helps them understand what they are feeling giving them ways to change their behavior present a solution that you think your child would be willing to try 12 x research source give the character another opportunity to face the same situation this time using the techniques they learned to successfully solve the problem for example after talking to miss cabbage little onion knew just what to say when the other kids at vegetable school called her stinky and she made sure to take a good bath in the sink that night your character in the story will successfully face the situation in the story using the new behavior or coping skills and will live happily ever after keep the story light and fictional people like to be entertained not preached at provide silly moments in the story and don t let it get too heavy remember you want to give the child tools to deal with the issue not leave them overwhelmed or daunted by it don t give the character the same name as the child consider making the protagonist the child s favorite animal or give them a silly nonsense name to make the child laugh use language close enough to what your child hears to allow them to make the connection to their own life just make sure you are changing it up enough so that it does not sound like the story is about them 13 x research source for example tommy make your bed could become silly goose make your nest create a fictional place for the setting don t give it the same name as the child s town or school while your story may need to contain consequences for the character s behavior do not make the consequences so dire that you will frighten the child for example robbie behaved so badly at school that he had to miss the pizza party would be better than robbie behaved so badly that the principal locked him in the janitor s closet for the rest

how to create rules for a book club,you ve lured people into your living room and fed them cookies until they ve agreed to join your book club but how do you keep enthusiasm high and discussions lively you re not drafting a constitution but it s still worth a little effort to keep everyone on the same page and minimize later issues,set book selection rules in a discussion book club the whole group reads the same book between each meeting usually one per month there are a couple ways to decide which books to read let anyone propose a book then have the club vote on the options try this if the members have a similar taste in books and don t want to explore new genres let one member choose each book rotating through the list this is a good way to explore a variety of works work your way through a list of books that have received a particular reward for quality pulitzer prize national book award excellence within a genre nebula walter scott prize or for qualities that lead to good discussion firecracker alternate book award banned book lists or various book club lists decide on a meeting location one common solution is to rotate hosting duties if not everyone has the ability to host rotate between those that can or find a meeting space in a church library or community center cafes are a fun option but they need to have plenty of space and a carefree policy toward noise set the atmosphere for many people socializing is just as important as the discussion this isn t a problem if everyone s on the same page if you d like a more serious discussion instead set a couple rules to make that clear if your group tends to derail the discussion with unrelated conversation divide the meetings into two parts start with casual chats then move on to focused discussion at a certain time if you really want good debate ask members not to show up unless they ve read at least part of the book this could go over poorly among close friends prep for the discussion people attend book clubs in their spare time and most will not want to put in extra time between meetings if you d like to improve the quality of discussion appoint a facilitator yourself or rotating among dedicated readers to lead the meeting this facilitator should prepare as follows read a couple reviews and brief author bios come up with a few discussion prompts print out handouts with key passages or extra info optional choose rules on new members if you want an intimate meeting for close friends ask members to keep it that way if you re interested in broader debates or meeting new people ask members to invite friends if you have a large meeting space you could even advertise in your local community come up with a member list this type of book club gathers a collection of books for its members to borrow the more people you invite the larger and more interesting your library that said for logistics reasons you may want to start with ten people or fewer set rules for book acquisition there are two common ways this type of club can function each member loans the club 1 3 books each meeting alternatively each member donates a certain amount of money each meeting the host for that month a rotating position spends the money to buy books for the club to enjoy decide where and when to meet unless you have a communal space to store the books the book club usually only borrows or returns books once every month or two this is also a good chance to trade recommendations and socialize it s usually easiest to have one person store the book collection and host the meetings so you don t have to transport the books consider putting out a donation box to reimburse this host for his time write down the loan policy here are a few suggested rules to keep the club running smoothly each member can borrow one book at a time each book is due back after a certain amount of time such as two months set a small fine for late books to be put in a communal fund for snacks or similar expenses set a larger fine for lost or damaged books to be given to the original owner of the book set a return schedule for space reasons most clubs won t want to keep their collection growing endlessly after a book has been around for a certain period of time say 6 to 12 months return it to its original owner or purchaser assign a member to track the loans one person should be responsible for a document that lists every book in the collection with the following information who currently has the book if anyone when the book is due back in the collection the original owner purchaser when the book is due to return to the original owner purchaser,Education-and-Communications
how to make a book club for kids,book clubs for kids provide excellent opportunities for learning and imagination starting a book club is easy all you need to do is drum up some interest among kids either your own or if you re a teacher those in your classroom and find out what they want to read define the goals and structure of the book club and select the ages of the children you want to participate then find out what they want to read and start reading,make sure everyone wants to be in a book club 1 x research source if you re a parent and trying to start a book club for your child ask your child if they wish to participate in the book club if you re a teacher or someone else with access to a larger body of kids ensure that at least a few of them are interested in participating in the book club decide who can participate 2 x research source in a book club for kids all the kids should be of about the same age and reading level if you re a teacher or leader of a youth organization you might have to make multiple book clubs one for second and third graders one for fourth and fifth graders and so on alternately you might make two clubs at each grade level one for advanced students and one for average readers book clubs work best with kids in second grade and up 3 x research source choose the size of the book club 4 x research source if the book club is too large not every child will get to participate if the book club is too small the same children might be reading the whole time and become weary of the tedium five to eight kids is usually the best size for a book club advertise your book club 5 x research source if your child has enough friends or classmates to make a club of adequate size there is no need to advertise the club however if you do not you could advertise the book club in your town ask your librarian to add the book club announcement to the library s website and newsletter alternately you could print a colorful flyer or two and put it up on the library s community bulletin board or on other boards in locations the kids frequent including the ymca roller skating rink or arcade if you re starting a book club for kids at your school you could encourage children to sign up using fliers on the library windows or ask the principal to add them to the end of the day announcements include all the relevant information when designing your flier or announcement include the date of the initial club meeting the location and the age ranges of the kids your want to join decide where to hold the book club 6 x research source the location where you host the book club depends on your situation whatever location you choose ensure it is well lit quiet clean and conducive to conversation ensure your location will accommodate all your readers and any adults in attendance if you re a parent you could choose to hold it at your house each week alternately you could share the responsibility of hosting it among the parents of the children in the book club if you re a librarian you should hold it in a smaller anteroom or children s room if you re a teacher you could hold it in your school s library or a classroom if your initial location doesn t work you can always change it later don t feel like you re locked in to a certain location forever if holding the book club at a house it s nice for the host to provide snacks for the kids start out with an organizational meeting 7 x research source an organizational meeting is an initial meeting between the kids in the book club and their parents or guardians this meeting will provide space for the children to get to know each other before the club begins reading allow time for the kids to talk freely but provide a structured activity to draw out kids who might be shy too have all the children sit in a circle and introduce themselves they should say hello my name is and list three facts about themselves provide board games and snacks for the children this will help them associate the book club with good feelings and happiness explain the rules of the club 8 x research source rules should be laid out for both parents and kids for instance maybe you want to insist that each child also has a parent present during the book club you don t want it to become daycare after all in reference to the actual book club you might set a rule that says only one person can talk at a time other rules might include 9 x research source be respectful to everyone in the book club raise your hand if you want to speak treat the book club location with respect explain the structure of the book club 10 x research source decide with the other parents and kids how often you want to meet and choose the days and times that work best explain the book club s process the process you choose depends on the children s ages and reading level if children are very competent readers they might read a book outside of the book club then talk about it in a guided conversation during the book club in that case the conversation will be guided by thoughtful questions from an adult monitor or group leader 11 x research source in other cases especially when children do not read as well or if the books are shorter in length the children will read a book together during the book club in this case each child will read a page or two and the monitor will stop to help explain confusing plot points or vocabulary at the end of the reading the group leader might ask questions to encourage the children to talk more about the ideas in the book alternately you might allow every child to read their own book or one of several books on a given theme then talk about each book in turn during the book club 12 x research source set the goals of the book club 13 x research source state at the outset what the overall vision or mission of the book club is you might target the book club to a specific age group or a particular set of students such as students who have trouble reading for instance you might say this book club is designed to help kids in fifth and sixth grade become better readers choose a theme 14 x research source a theme is a central topic or idea that all the books in the club revolve around for instance you might choose oceans as the theme for a given month in this case all the books you read would be about animals adventures and curiosities of the ocean if the book club reads one book or two books each month you could choose a theme that lasts around three months if your book club is more advanced and reads one book each week your theme might last only one month after completing one themed cycle of books ask the club members what theme they d like next choose the book or books you ll be reading 15 x research source it s a good idea to decide at least one month ahead of time what book the club will read next let the kids vote on the book they want to read first have a few choices ready to offer the children read a variety of books switch it up frequently and read both fiction mysteries young adult novels and science fiction and nonfiction historical works books about science and so on drop some poetry in there once in a while too 16 x research source encourage kids to look for the book s at local libraries if you don t know what books the kids might like ask your local librarian for advice or ask the kids directly during the first organizational meeting what they like to read 17 x research source after deciding on the book s you ll read reserve copies of the book at your local library if you reserve the book s at a bookstore be sure that the parents of the book club members pay you back structure the discussion every club meeting should have two discussion leaders the team should include one book club member and one of their parents together this team should guide the discussion but not dominate it by asking questions and determining who can talk this helps maintain order and ensure everyone gets a chance to speak facilitators should prepare leading questions before the meeting in order to ensure the discussion is productive and thought provoking good questions include what was the setting what kind of book is this is it a true story why did a certain character choose a certain course of action offer encouragement to reluctant readers presumably children who enroll in a book club already enjoy reading sometimes though kids might be forced to attend by their parents and might not enjoy reading there are a variety of reasons children might not like to read if a member of the book club does not like to read you can offer encouragement by trying one of several methods 18 x research source if the child is bored by reading find out what he or she likes to read and try to introduce more books that the reluctant reader would like to the club if the child lacks confidence in his or her ability don t force them to read at length or at all during the oral reading period alternately if the book club is one in which the children are reading individual books steer the child toward a book that is easy to read encourage children to take their time when reading or formulating questions and answers don t be too formal 19 x research source the book club shouldn t feel like a literature class let the kids lead the conversation keep them focused on the book and ask leading questions if there is a lull in the conversation but don t be afraid to let them take off with their ideas if kids don t like the book prod them to explain why they don t like it other questions you could ask include which character was your favorite if you want to include a questionnaire for the kids to fill out after reading each book keep it short and simple and make it optional for instance you might create a questionnaire asking simply did you like this book why or why not add something extra 20 x research source after reading a book you could allow time for the kids to do a fun craft related to the book they read for example kids who read a book about oceans might then partake in a craft that lets them design a little sailboat out of tongue depressors or use colored construction paper to make a crab lobster or whale don t make crafts too elaborate the focus should remain on the book and the conversation about the book 21 x research source you could also invite guest speakers to talk about the topic of a book for instance if you read a mystery book one week you could invite a police officer or detective to talk about how the book relates to their work give the kids some neat bookmarks with pictures on them if you re a librarian distribute free pens or pencils with the library s name and logo on them,Education-and-Communications

your reading via social media it s helpful to write down a few impressions about all of the books you read which you can draw upon when deciding whether to recommend a book to a friend 14 x research source buy them the book you want them to read if you ve ever been given a book by a close friend you ll know how convincing this tactic can be once you give them the book they will see it everywhere and feel like they should read it of course you should give them something that is well suited to their preferences rather than forcing them to read something that you like 15 x research source make references to the book in conversation start making side references to the book you want them to read by peppering your conversation with little references to the book they ll become intrigued and

how to sustain book club membership,a book club is only as good as its members without a steady base of committed members you book club will inevitably falter and fall apart the first hurdle to overcome is finding members who are genuinely interested in being a part of your book club the second biggest hurdle is transforming simple interest into undying commitment,ask the people you know many friends gravitate toward one another due to shared interests making your circle of friends an ideal place to start friends family and acquaintances are all up for grabs though you should only ask people who you think might be interested in joining for the sake of being part of a book club rather than those who may agree to join just to please you otherwise the likelihood of you being able to keep them committed will not be as high you can also ask the people you know to spread the word your great aunt sally may not be interested in joining but her best friend s niece might be mentioning your book club to non interested parties and asking them to pass the word along is a simple way to advertise to people you do not know post messages around town look for community bulletin boards located in churches libraries or gyms similarly if your office has a bulletin board feel free to post an advertisement for your book club there as long as doing so does not violate office policy of course you could also try posting an invite to boards online but you will need to find a website that tailors to your local community a message board for your community will work as will a free online classifieds service put in a request with the venue if your book club meets a library or book store ask the venue for help recruiting new members a librarian or book store manager is likely to know many people who love books if the person in charge has already allowed your book club to meet there that person may also be willing to help you find interested members talk to other book clubs book clubs are not necessarily competitive about membership a book club that has grown too large for itself might be willing to give you the contact information for anyone who they needed to turn away due to size constraints additionally another book club may have a few members that might be interested in joining your club in addition to their original club if the focus is different keep the discussions lively one of the fastest ways to lose interest is to have meeting after meeting of awkward silence people come to a book club to talk about books and if the talking stops so does the coming come to each meeting with a list of open ended questions to ask about each book if you are the facilitator of the group it is your responsibility to keep things on track when people start to get quiet or begin talking about too many off topic matters if you are only an ordinary member you hold just as much responsibility as anyone else to speak up anyone interested in generating further interest among the members of a book club must first go the extra length to show his or her own intense interest maintain a comfortable atmosphere a book club is nothing more than a social group that meets for a specific purpose a good book club needs structure but if you have too much structure members may start to feel uncomfortable a simple way to nurture a comfortable environment is to show interest in the other members a simple greeting of it s good to see you can go a long way in making someone feel welcome let everyone have their say 1 x research source within any group of people you will find talkers and listeners that does not mean that the listeners have nothing of their own to add though pay close attention to the group s dynamics if one or two people seem to control the entire conversation while someone else keeps getting interrupted politely stop the talkers and casually ask for the oppressed listener s thoughts another important thing to remember is that everyone s opinion should be treated with respect you may not agree with an interpretation that one of your club s members brings up but that is no reason for you or any other club member to be offensive club members should discuss their different opinions civilly and be stopped once the conversation starts turning nasty make sure to read books that people want instead of letting one person have complete control over the reading list your club s membership will thrive longer if more people have a say you can either take turns picking books or have the members vote on options brought up by everyone whatever you choose to do make sure that all the members feel as though their likes and dislikes are being addressed set some rules about attendance book clubs only work if the members are willing to show up everyone will inevitably miss a meeting here or there but if someone consistently demonstrates a lack of interest by never showing up it can be discouraging to the other members it is better to cut that person loose and find a new member forbidding members from attending if they are not up to date in their reading may turn some people away on the other hand being too lax about the reading requirement can lead to a room of people who have yet to make it past chapter five in the same book for the last three months have a reading requirement but enforce it loosely enough to keep people comfortable bribe members with food 2 x research source simple refreshments like coffee and cookies can work for nearly any meeting you could also try enhancing the reading by making a related food selection for instance if a character talks about a certain dish in the book try preparing that dish to bring to the club similarly if your club is reading an 18th century british classic consider a snack that calls that era to mind meet for a related event field trips and other fun events help the members bond as a group and may increase each member s sense of attachment or belonging if the book your club is reading was ever made into a film adaptation meet separately one night for a showing of the movie invite an expert to talk to your group you can talk to a literature professor or local writer for generic books if you are reading a book about a specific topic you could also have an expert from that field come to your group and talk read something local and visit the places mentioned in the book oftentimes you can find a book that centers around your hometown or a nearby area read that book and take a field trip to the places mentioned in it keep everyone in the loop have a contact list with addresses phone numbers and email addresses whenever there is a change make sure to personally speak with each member to inform him or her of the change if possible you may even want to set up an email group or online community to make communication between members easier,Education-and-Communications
how to start a women s book club,a women s book club can be a great way to make new friends with women who share your passion for reading there is far more to setting up a women s book club than simply inviting other women over to your house to talk about books though you need to establish the format and rules of the group before anything else you also need to learn how to choose insightful or entertaining books that can appeal to a wide range of women,settle on a time to meet as a general rule weeknights are better than weekends narrowing down the best possible time can be a challenge in itself though a meeting that starts at 7 00 to 7 30 pm gives your members just enough time to eat dinner with their families and may make it possible for them to get back home before bedtime if they have children meetings can start anytime between 6 30 pm and 8 00 pm if your target membership consists of single women or women without children if you want members who are stay at home moms you can also meet during the late morning or early afternoon when kids are at school think of a meeting that starts sometime between 10 00 am and 1 00 pm decide how often to meet most book clubs meet about once per month since a monthly meeting gives each member ample time to read each book if you want your book club to be a little closer knit you can also meet on a weekly or bi weekly basis to discuss each book as you read it setting up checkpoints such as having the first half of the book read within two weeks can help keep members at the same pace if you do opt to meet on a monthly basis you can stay in touch in between meetings via e mail staying in touch with one another can be just as effective at building a stronger connection amongst your members as meeting in person each week choose the right atmosphere many women s book clubs are meant to be a little personal so meeting in one another s homes can work wonderfully if you or your members feel uncomfortable with this idea you can opt to meet at a coffee shop or library take turns hosting if you do meet at one another s homes ask each member who feels comfortable or who has the space to hold a few meetings in her home this prevents the stress from resting squarely on the shoulders of one or two people offer snacks whether buying bottled water and commercially packaged cookies or baking a fancy layer cake and brewing homemade iced tea refreshments are a good way to get people to relax and open up the snacks can be as elaborate or simple as you d prefer and you can also ask other members to contribute once your group gets established keep things casual but maintain a few rules a women s book club is a good way to make new friends but if you keep the structure too loose your club may lose its purpose make it a rule that each member must read the book before coming to club you should also have some rule or guideline about how often each member must show up and you should strongly encourage members to let you or someone else know when they cannot come give your members an idea of how long the meetings should last the modern woman is a busy person and knowing just how long a meeting will last can go a long way in encouraging her to come in the first place many book clubs meet for about 60 minutes but you can trim that down to 30 minutes if your members are exceptionally busy or if you meet on a weekly or bi weekly basis consider scheduling in a bit of extra time for socializing as your club members get closer the temptation to talk about off topic matters will almost certainly increase you may want to schedule an extra 15 to 30 minutes before or after official book club business for members to chat and socialize about non club matters start small a group of five to eight members can be cozy and may offer a diverse enough range of ideas to get things going as your club gains momentum you can consider picking up a few extra members as long as your meeting space permits it of course you generally do not want to exceed 12 to 15 members however since larger numbers make it harder for everyone to speak ask friends and relatives start with the women especially those who you know love to read if you cannot find enough women to join among your loved ones you can ask the men in your life to pass word of your book club onto other women they know move on to acquaintances women who you have a working relationship with or neighbors who you know but rarely speak to are good places to start you can also extend the invitation to women you see all the time like your favorite coffee shop clerk as long as they are familiar enough with you to know your name and face advertise with caution you can hang flyers up at the local library or post an ad in your city s newspaper but you may not want to accept anyone and everyone who contacts you for further information make sure that each woman who calls is really serious about attending and ask a few questions over the phone to get to know her a bit before inviting her over to your house for the first meeting if you invite too many women who you do not know you may want to consider holding the first meeting in a public place look for books that cover women s issues both historical and contemporary issues are up for grabs just remember that not every woman will share the same opinion especially concerning contemporary political issues keep an open mind and use the experience to learn from each other rather than arguing search out books with strong female protagonists women are generally more avid readers than men so plenty of modern books follow the lives of savvy businesswomen or strong mothers fill your book roster with these books to inspire and encourage your members study the works of female authors you can choose historically significant writers like jane austen or the brontë sisters or contemporary authors like p d james or nora roberts you can also mix and match and spend time comparing the ways that female writers of the past wrote versus female writers of the present start with books you ve been dying to read while your book club is just starting up you may need to take the initiative and decide the first few books if there are any you have in mind that might be a good fit for your women s book club add them to the list otherwise you can look up a few bestseller lists to get ideas allow other members to make suggestions after your club establishes itself the other member will probably appreciate having the chance to offer their own input about the book selection you can have each woman take turns choosing a book alternatively you could also have each member bring up a possible title whenever she thinks of one and have the book voted on as a group before adding it to the roster come with discussion questions as the founder of the group you may need to kick off each meeting by getting the discussion going ask questions that invite the other members to analyze themes characters or implications stay away from questions that can be answered by sharing one s unfounded opinion or by stating a simple yes or no ask the other members to come with questions if each member comes to the meeting with a question or unique insight a broader range of perspectives can be covered the conversation will last longer and be twice as thought provoking nudge the group back on track if the discussion gets derailed if your members stray too far away from discussing the book and start talking about other matters politely step in and ask a question to get the conversation back to the book,Education-and-Communications

much the members need to read for the next meeting the right length depends on the book s difficulty and when you ll be meeting next if your group meets a lot you can limit the reading to a few chapters look ahead to make sure these chapters are easy to complete and are compelling enough to discuss ideas for books can come from group members bestseller lists or recommendations from other book clubs reassure the group members that they re welcome even when they don t finish the reading they can still be part of the group and may still have something to contribute don t be afraid to adapt the schedule as you go sometimes you may need more discussion time on a previous reading consult your group members to come up with a plan decide who will guide the next meeting many groups let the person who suggested the book lead the first discussion as group leader you ll likely do this yourself at first when you move on to new books you can try taking turns don t force anyone to lead but do try to spread the responsibility around to other group members 9 x research source the leader should bring in a few questions or discussion topics starter questions don t have to be complex a simple one is so what did you think of the book establish a discussion schedule some groups are more socialization than discussion most groups benefit from having both remember what you want out of

discussion 10 x research source ask about refreshments food and drinks make everything better if you re meeting at a restaurant or cafe you probably won t need to bring anything you may decide that everyone should bring a dish from home you may also end up providing a light snack figure out what your group should have and who should bring it 11 x research source it can be useful to have everyone bring a dish so one person isn t stuck preparing all the food you may also alternate who brings what by creating a schedule write down notes on the book as you read the book jot down the parts that stand out to you mark important quotations character developments or other details include page numbers so everyone can find these parts again bring in your notes and use them to have a great group discussion 12 x research source come up with questions asking people what they thought of the book is an acceptable starting question use your notes to come up with deeper questions or search online for discussion ideas write out a list of non specific book questions in case discussion starts to stall 13 x research source examples of non specific questions include what was the book s message who did you identify with how did the characters change why did the author choose this title keep things moving when the discussion dies down as the group leader it s your job to keep people engaged pay attention to when people seem unenthusiastic or don t have much to say about a topic keeping up the energy level is important to making your group a success people won t come back if they feel bored for example ask the group about the book s theme if discussion is slow say i thought what that character did embodied the theme or i really liked how the author expressed the theme by saying this explain what the character did or what the author wrote ask group members for questions open the floor up to the other members is there something about the book they want to ask get them involved and

conversation going,select the book you ll be discussing book clubs use lots of different methods to choose new books typically the book selected for the next club meeting is decided during the prior meeting 1 x research source books on the 100 best books list of a major periodical are good choices as are current bestsellers consider both fiction and nonfiction when choosing a book choose a meeting place some book clubs can be hosted in your home if your home is too small to host the book club or if you simply don t want to host the club meeting at your home choose a communal location like a library conference room or a cafe 2 x research source if you plan on hosting at a library be sure to reserve a conference room well in advance of the book club meeting you might not be able to get one at the last minute set the date and time if your book club has a regular meeting date and time for instance 8 00 every first monday of the month there s no need to set the date and time however if the date and time of your book club varies decide when the meeting will occur and let the club members know 3 x research source there are many ways to let club members know when the next meeting will be you could for instance call each of them with the information you could also send a mass email containing the date and time if you prefer a more personal touch you could mail out an invitation with the relevant information designate a conversation leader the structure of each book club is a bit different and there are no strict rules regarding how to designate a leader in fact some book clubs don t have a leader at all however selecting a leader can help the conversation stay on topic and enrich the book club meeting 4 x research source the book club s host often doubles as the conversation leader you could also choose to invite a subject matter expert to lead the meeting for instance if you re reading a book about the french revolution you might invite a local professor

flowing even if you are not the conversation leader though having some questions ready to ask the group can make your meeting more enjoyable 5 x research source if your book club is reading a well known book you ll probably be able to find some study guides with questions in them online or in book stores for instance if you re reading 1984 you might run a search like 1984 study questions through your preferred search engine if you re reading a book that doesn t have questions available for it online read the book carefully and come up with some open ended questions that can elicit thoughtful reactions from club members encourage club members to turn their phones off phones can be a serious distraction from conducting an effective book club before the meeting begins ask everyone kindly to turn their phones off use a friendly tone when doing so 6 x research source ask club members to write down questions or comments at the beginning of the book club hand everyone a pen or pencil and an index card encourage them to write a question or comment on an index card collect the cards before you get started then read them out loud or hand them to the conversation leader to read aloud invite responses to these questions and comments 7 x research source having book club participants write their thoughts on index cards can allow club members who are less outgoing to share their thoughts too this is also a useful method for facilitating conversation on controversial books plan to socialize after you ve discussed the book hosting and attending a book club should be fun but some people like to use book club time to chat with friends include a designated social time at the end of the meeting for such off topic conversations that way people who are there to talk and think more about the book get the opportunity to do so 8 x research source if a club member is talking excessively and wandering off topic help them refocus their attention on the book with gentle but firm directions for instance if someone is talking about their weekend plans instead of about what they think of the book transition back to the conversation by saying let s talk about the third chapter was anyone surprised by the protagonist s decision select a theme for the book club in addition to regular snacks like cheese and crackers look for simple recipes that reflect the cuisine of a particular region country or setting in the book for example if the story was set in italy you might serve bruschetta and italian wine 9 x research source additionally you could emphasize the theme of your club meeting by including some decor that evokes a character or setting from the book 10 x research source for instance if you re reading alice in wonderland you could purchase some themed items including coasters candles or decorative art that refer to alice and her adventures around the meeting space don t forget to offer some beverages to help wash down the snacks wine water coffee tea and soda are the easiest options find out what sort of snacks your group wants after deciding on the theme ask for suggestions from book club members regarding what snacks they d like if any if your meeting does not have a specific theme simple snacks like crackers cookies and crisps are popular options 11 x research source some book clubs are happy without snacks of any kind others leave it to each group member to bring their own snacks still others leave it to the host to prepare snacks or hors d oeuvres when hosting a book club be sure to ask about food allergies and dietary preferences before preparing a snack include some general book themed decor instead of selecting a specific book related theme for your book club meeting you might want to introduce general book centric paraphernalia to set the mood if you re hosting the club in your home there are many options available for sprucing up a regular living room or other space with book club themed items 12 x research source for instance you might be able to obtain pillow covers or pillows embroidered with images of books you could place some bookish art such as art printed on book pages or paintings of people

how to start a business book club,business book clubs are the perfect opportunity to read and discuss the newest and most beneficial business related books while squeezing in a little extra networking while the main point of a business book club is to learn new information and collaborate with other professionals about innovative ideas starting and leading a business book club can also improve your reputation within the local business community,figure out where to meet you will likely want to keep the meetings professional so personal locations like home should be avoided conference rooms whether at an office or in a library are usually best for a business book club if you cannot secure a conference room meeting in a coffee shop or restaurant that has space for large talkative groups to meet are the next best thing decide how often to meet standard protocol is once a month meeting more often may make it difficult for members to keep up on a reading schedule but meeting less often can make it hard for members to focus and many may lose interest choose when to meet you must consider time and date weekdays are generally better than weekends since many people may feel hesitant about surrendering a portion of their saturday or sunday for book club you should meet in the early evening around 7 00 pm to give your members enough time to come home and grab something to eat before going to book club meeting too late may make it difficult for them to get a full night s sleep before getting up in the morning for work though stick with a consistent meeting date for instance choosing the first wednesday or the third thursday of every month will make it easier for your members to remember the meeting date and schedule around it accordingly know how long you expect each meeting to take a standard length is about 60 minutes but if you and your members are on a tight schedule you might be able to shorten that to 30 minutes conversely if you want time to socialize or talk about non club topics you may want to schedule an optional 30 minutes for interested members to hang around and socialize after official meeting business is over set some ground rules start with the basics you don t need anything too extreme to keep your book club in working condition the most important rules are to read the book before each meeting and to actually show up to the meetings members who are unable to show up to a meeting should let you know beforehand members who plan to come to a meeting should show up on time everyone should show respect for one another s opinions no one should use the business book club as a blatant excuse to pitch his or her business keep in touch the business book club much like the modern business world benefits greatly from the use of technology ask members for their cell phone numbers and e mail addresses each member should at the very least be able to communicate with one another via e mail you can also consider setting up a blog forum or other website for your business book group to use for communication purposes these extra steps are not necessary but they can be especially helpful for large or expanding groups offer refreshments they don t need to be anything much just about anyone will appreciate a pot of coffee and a box of donuts or a pizza and soft drinks at the start the expense will rest on your shoulders once your business book club gains momentum however you can ask other members if they might also be willing to bring something edible to share if your meetings happen in a place that already serves food like a coffee shop or restaurant offering your own refreshments is unnecessary know how many members to recruit the ideal size for a business book club is about 10 to 12 people since most people will miss a meeting here or there you will probably be short one or two people each meeting having fewer members may make it difficult to get an active discussion going but having more members may make it equally difficult for everyone to chime in during the discussion ask your co workers unless you hate everyone at your office the most sensible place to start is at your own place of work odds are you know many of the people there well enough to determine if they would make a valuable addition to your book club you also know that many of their business interests will line up with your own especially if they work in your department bring it up to your current business contacts if you just signed a new client or are in the middle of pitching a new deal refrain from mentioning your book club since it has nothing to do with the business between you and the other party if you are on good terms a first name basis with contacts from partnering companies however you could consider telling them about your new business book club via e mail or during non office hours mention the club to others in your general field you will want to keep the subjects discussed at your book club fairly focused and the best way to do that is to make sure that your members are all interested in the same thing for instance if you work in sales you will probably have different interests than someone who works in the it department spread the word through friends and family even if none of your friends or relatives share your vision or are in the same field of business they may know someone who is tell your loved ones about your new book club and ask them to pass to word along to anyone they know who might be interested advertise put an ad in the local paper or post one on a free classifieds website you can also scour business blogs and message boards that have posters who live locally decide what type of business books your club will focus on there is a world of difference between books about starting your own business and books about climbing your way up the corporate ladder in an existing business likewise someone interested in reading about improving sales may not be as interested in reading about how to manage subordinates decide what books your club will focus on before you start and let potential members know before they decide to join take requests ask your members for book suggestions as the leader you can have the final say about whether or not each suggestion will be taken alternatively you can put each request up for a vote or allow each member to take a turn selecting a book without taking any vote peruse bestseller lists and business blogs the internet is a valuable resource use it to find out about the business books that have grabbed the attention of professionals everywhere if so many people are interested in a book the information it contains may be worth adding to your own information bank pick out books in advance instead of choosing the next book to read immediately before having to read it determine a roster of books several months in advance that way members have plenty of time to research what the book is about and to grab a copy of it share your thoughts and ask questions as the leader of the group it is your job to get the ball rolling mention a few key points you found interesting or a handful of ideas you feel skeptical about ask questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no and offer opinions that are open enough to be debated encourage others to ask questions a business book club is not a lecture after all make sure that anyone who has a question or idea has the opportunity to voice it if your members are exceptionally quiet from meeting to meeting you may consider twisting their arm a little by requesting that everyone bring at least one discussion question to each meeting,Education-and-Communications
how to start a library book club,if you want to start a book club consider starting a library book club instead of one that meets at home or in another public place library book clubs meet inside library facilities and are a good way to help your local library by drawing traffic there these clubs may also enjoy a few privileges associated with the library since large library conference rooms may allow you to invite more members and appreciative library staff may even consider giving your club first access to new books,find a nearby library with a conference room many public libraries have conference rooms that are open for public use but private libraries or public libraries in smaller towns may not have a conference room within the facility if your city or county does not have an available room look for a nearby library that will allow you to set up a club even if you are outside of its district ask the library if a book club already meets there some libraries may not want more than one library book club to meet on the premises others may not mind but remember that many people who want to be part of a library book club may already be members of the other club or clubs fill out the necessary paperwork most libraries do not require extensive paperwork to start a new club but almost all libraries will have some at the very least the library will probably ask you to read a list of rules about hosting a club and to sign your name to a sheet of paper documenting that you read those rules ask if the library allows refreshments most public libraries are fine with light refreshments such as punch as cookies as long as they are kept within the conference room not all libraries are fine with it however so you should check before deciding whether or not to provide

to any genre decide how often to meet most book clubs meet about once a month meeting on a monthly basis gives most members ample time to read each book moreover a monthly meeting does not overtax library resources figure out when to meet as a general rule weekdays work better for more people than weekends if you want to attract a crowd of retirees or stay at home moms meeting in the late morning or early afternoon works best if you want to attract teens you should shoot for the early evening if you want to attract college students or working adults the late evening may work even better stick with one set day out of each month such as the third tuesday or the fourth thursday go with a day of the week instead of a date since dates can fall out on the weekend just as easily as

how to start an african american book club,african american literature has a strong present influenced by a strong past starting an african american book club is a good way to support african american authors while exploring issues faced by the african american community as a whole,figure out where to meet the meeting place you choose will determine the tone and size of your group if you plan on keeping it in your home or among the homes of your members you should try to keep it a more intimate group consisting of no more than eight people if you decide to use public space like a library or a restaurant with a meeting room you can open membership up to 12 or more members 1 x research source set a meeting time the meeting time may need to be altered depending on what is most convenient for your members but having a meeting time pre determined can give prospective members an idea of whether or not they can fit the club into their schedules meeting at night will open up club membership to working parents weekends are generally out though since most people prefer to have weekends to themselves if you do choose a weekend day opt for sunday over saturday determine how often to gather giving your members a month to read a book makes it easier for busy members to finish the reading but if you do not mind meeting to talk about the book as you read it you could try meeting every week or every other week just realize that busier members may not be able to make a weekly meeting make sure to meet at roughly the same time each week or month for instance if you only meet once a month you could hold your meetings on the second thursday of every month if you meet twice a month you could choose the first and third tuesday of every month this consistency makes it easier for members to plan around the meeting set a few ground rules to get running you do not need anything too elaborate or strict you should consider setting rules about how many meetings members can miss or how often members can show up to meetings without doing the reading first exceptions can always be made of course but having ground rules will help your members treat the club seriously be prepared to lead as the founder of the book club it will likely fall to you to moderate discussions make sure that the members stay on track and that conversation does not stray too far from topic also be prepared to ask insightful questions to spur discussion determine how exclusive membership should be as an african american book club you have the option of limiting membership to african americans or opening it to anyone who is interested in studying african american literature limiting membership may make everyone feel more comfortable and open about their remarks but opening membership can ultimately provide a greater number of different perspectives ask yourself if you want to limit membership on gender having a mixed sex book club can lead to more interesting discussions but limiting the membership by male or female can make your members feel more comfortable and may make it easier to choose books that appeal to the entire group even if you do not put a limit on the gender book clubs tend to be predominantly composed of females so you may find yourself being part of an all female book club without intending to be figure out how many members you want a group that is too small will not be very lively but a group that is too large may make it impossible for everyone who wants to speak to get a chance to do so typically book clubs have between 5 and 15 members smaller groups have a more personal feeling to them but larger groups invite a greater diversity in opinion alert your family friends and acquaintances 2 x research source even if no one you know wants to join your book club someone may know someone who would the more people you talk to about your book club the greater your odds of spreading the word around your community are advertise your new book club ask your library church or local community center if you can post a flyer on their bulletin board you can also post an ad on a free online classifieds for your city or community in your advertisements specify that you are starting an african american book club and provide an email address or phone number for interested parties to contact you at narrow down your field of interest african american literature is a broad category determine if you are want to cover fiction books non fiction books or both for fiction books ask yourself if there are certain genres you want to cover or if any genre is fine similarly for non fiction books ask yourself if there are specific categories or topics that you want to include on your book list set the tone if you want to start an african american book club that promotes books written by african americans you can have a light hearted tone and compile a list of contemporary novels on the other hand if you want to use the club to take a serious look at issues affecting african americans of both the past and present the books you choose should be more literary inspiration or serious in tone if opting for a book club that focuses on african american issues you may also want to consider whether or not your club should only read books written by african americans authors of other races have also written books dealing with african american issues and these can be especially useful if you are interested in gauging perspectives of the past search african american book lists online you can go to online african american book clubs and search their selection or you can look at blogs message boards social network communities online book lists and other websites aimed at appealing to an african american demographic contact online african american book clubs for suggestions 3 x research source there are several notable online african american book clubs you might be able to contact the person running one of these clubs and ask him or her for book recommendations if you explain that you are setting up an african american book club in your community the online club might be more accommodating and helpful,Education-and-Communications
how to start a science fiction book club,the first step in creating any book club is to narrow your focus if you have narrowed your focus down to the science fiction genre you are already well on your way to creating your book club in order to successfully create a science fiction book club you should also determine the specific science fiction topics your club will cover apart from that you must also gather members and set up club basics such as the meeting time and place,stick with space oriented sub genres space is one of the most commonly explored themes in science fiction but within the broad category of space there are a number of different sub genres for you to build your book list from these sub genres include alien invasions the colonization of different worlds first contact galactic empires space exploration and space operas make time for time time travel is nearly as popular as space travel it may be a little more difficult to find a plethora of time travel books but you can weave one into your book list on occasion to mix things up think of the future the majority of science fiction books take place at some point in the future even those books that are oriented with space or technology for some sci fi sub genres however thinking about the future is the main point rather than merely a setting detail books that fall within the dystopian human development and pos apocalyptic sub genres are especially future oriented escape to an alternate reality books are a sort of escape in and of themselves but you can offer the members of your book group an even greater sense of escape by filling your book roster with alternate reality sub genres alternate realities include alternate histories and timelines parallel dimensions and virtual reality be a punk the punk sub genres are fairly recent but growing in popularity steampunk is the most notable punk sub genre but others like cyberpunk have since come into creation as well steampunk takes place in victorian esque settings but weaves fantastical steam and gear powered inventions into the story cyberpunk pairs cybernetic technology with a breakdown of social order focus on technology technological feats are probably just as popular a theme in science fiction as space exploration a book club focused on technology based science fiction has a wide range of sub genres to choose from including artificial intelligence nano technology mind uploading and singularity the idea of a major but short live technological boom determine whether you want hard sci fi or soft sci fi hard sci fi focuses on scientific accuracy and most hard sci fi deals with technology soft sci fi relies more heavily on sciences that are less precise such as psychology and anthropology mix and match sub genres if you only have an interest in certain types of science fiction then you should build your club and its book roster around that interest if however you have an interest in science fiction no matter what the genre is you can spice things up by planning a book club that will cover a range of topics branch into other speculative fiction sometimes the boundaries between science fiction fantasy and horror get blurred for instance some science fiction takes place in a future that has for whatever reason reverted back into fantasy like sword and sorcery state similarly some post apocalyptic books portray a world filled with the grotesque mutants and violence common to the horror genre you can really push the envelop by including a few books that could be classified within these other genres compile a list of classics if you do not know where to start consider paying homage to the classics that helped build the science fiction genre into what it is today the list of science fiction classics includes but is certainly not limited to h g wells s the time machine and war of the worlds philip k dick s do androids dream of electric sheep isaac asimov s i robot aldous huxley s brave new world orson scott card s ender s game george orwell s 1984 and ray bradbury s fahrenheit 451 pull books off the bestseller list when all else fails pull titles off bestselling science fiction lists science fiction bestsellers usually consist of both recent titles and classics being turned into movies settle on a number a group that is too small may not have much to say but a group that is too large may prevent some people from participating usually groups that range between 5 and 15 people are a good size smaller groups will create a more personal atmosphere but slightly larger groups will allow for a greater exchange of ideas and may be ideal for science fiction book clubs contact friends and family ask anyone you know who likes science fiction to join your group you can also bring it up to people who do not like sci fi and ask them to pass word along to anyone they know who might be interested advertise put posters up in your local library or create ads on free online classifieds you can also advertise in science fiction forums online even though these forums already offer members the chance to discuss their favorite stories some members may also be interested in participating in an actual book club especially if they want to meet with local sci fi fanatics in person find a good meeting place the size of your group will likely impact the space you need in a meeting place homes tend to work well for smaller groups but library conference rooms and restaurants with secluded sections tend to work better for larger groups alternatively you can also meet online if your members are scattered across a broad distance or simply prefer to interact via the computer you can set up your own blog e mail list or forum to facilitate discussion smallurl https www

need to balance your members schedules after dinner tends to be a popular choice since most people work during the morning and afternoon and participants with young children can put their kids down for the night before attending meeting well after dinner also means that you do not need to provide a meal figure out how often to meet if you want to discuss your books as you read them then you may consider meeting every one or two weeks if you prefer to discuss the books only after you finish them however you may opt for meeting on a monthly basis especially since many science fiction books are fairly long and may take that long to finish if your members have busy schedules make use of technology this is a science fiction book club after all so the odds or running into a member with a technology phobia is rare even if you meet offline and in person you can still set up a blog or online forum to facilitate discussion in between meetings you should also keep contact with your group via e mail to inform them of any changes or other pertinent information cover the ground rules stress the importance of reading the books and making the meetings without these two elements your book club will completely fall apart you should also make sure that each member knows when your club meets how long meetings will last and any rules surrounding the discussion of books in your club learn how to lead you will need to decide whether you will moderate each session or if you will take turns with other members you should also determine whether to follow a formal set of discussion questions

how to start a romance book club,a romance book club is an excellent way to meet with old friends or make new friends who share similar interests members are the first thing you need when starting up any book club to find members for a romance book club you should look in places where lovers of romance are likely to linger you must also figure out how to organize book club meetings as well as how to choose romances that are appropriate for your club,determine how many members you hope to have too few members may mean that the conversation will run dry too soon while too many members could make some uncomfortable and may make it impossible for everyone to get a turn to talk consider the atmosphere you want to create generally romance book clubs tend to be a little more personal and close knit so you may want to shoot for a limit of four to eight members keep gender in mind women are generally more likely to join a book club and this is especially true for romance book clubs while you probably won t have many men asking for admittance you should still decide whether or not to even allow them to join romance novels tend to be fairly intimate and some women may feel uncomfortable talking about them in when men are around bear in mind age and circumstance a 16 year old single girl is likely to have different ideas about romance than a 32 year old married mother of three you do not need to put a strict limit on who can join but setting an age range may help your group to focus its interests contact your friends the easiest way to find new members is to ask friends and family with a passion for reading to join you you can also spread the word to friends who would not be interested in joining just in case they know someone who might be post an ad put a flyer up at your local library take out an ad in the paper or post about your new club on a free classifieds website with a section for your region describe the purpose of your group the types of romance books you plan on reading and any restrictions on membership comb through online communities devoted to romance fiction message boards and blogs dedicated to the discussion of romance books are a good place to start even though these websites already offer book discussions a few of the members may be interested in breaking off into a smaller group to discuss a specific book similarly if enough members are from the same geographic location they may want to meet in person to discuss their favorite romances post on related forums as well message boards tailored to women or those that discuss love and relationships are likely to have a few members who enjoy a good romance novel and have an interest in joining your club meet in private if your group is small enough and your members are comfortable enough with each other you can meet in your homes as the group s leader you can either hold each meeting in your own home or ask if anyone else would be willing to take turns hosting no one should feel pressured into hosting however meet in public choose a public place that offers some level of privacy otherwise the shyest of your members may not feel comfortable voicing her ideas and opinions on the intimate details think library conference rooms restaurants with secluded seating and sparsely populated parks meet online you can set up a small forum chat room blog social media group or e mail group this may make it difficult for any members who are not technologically adept but this option also allows you to meet with members from virtually any geographic location plus you never need to worry about needing to cancel a meeting due to bad weather or construction decide how often to meet if you only want to meet whenever you finish a book you may want to schedule your meetings on a monthly basis if you want to meet periodically to discuss the book in the midst of reading it schedule meetings on a weekly or bi weekly basis set a few basic rules the biggest most obvious rules are to show up and to read the book you may not need to set up any official rules outside of that unless problems arise between members later on figure out the format will you consistently lead discussions or should each member take a turn should you come up with a list of discussion questions to cover or would members be better off saying whatever is on their mind it may take you a few meetings before you can figure out what discussion format works best for your group make time for gossip reading about romance may make the members of your group want to talk about their own love lives but doing so in the midst of book club takes away from valuable discussion time instruct members who want to socialize to meet a little beforehand or invite them to stay past your scheduled book club time set the heat level romance books range from sugary sweet and innocent to saucy and erotic and not every reader will enjoy both degrees talk with your members to determine what level of heat everyone feels comfortable with alternatively you can start by selecting the heat level you would be most interested in reading and aim to find members with the same tastes stick with one sub genre romance books generally fall under a specific sub genre if you want to keep things focused and simple select one sub genre and stick to books that fall into that category generally when most people think of a straightforward romance novel they think of contemporary romance these books take place after world war ii and involved realistic characters and scenarios pick books from multiple sub genres to make things a little more interesting mix up your sub genres every now and then you could start with a contemporary romance before switching to a historical romance after that you could branch into paranormal romance romantic suspense inspirational romance or any other sub genre venture into nonfiction the goal of your club is to read romance books but not every romance book is completely fictitious give your members a refreshing look at reality by occasionally selecting a book based on a true romance read a classic romance think of jane austen or the brontë sisters the books these authors wrote describe romances that have resonated with readers throughout the ages reading a classic here or there pays homage to these early pioneers of the romance genre select a current bestseller plenty of romance books make the bestseller list if all else fails simply choose a romance book that everybody s talking about the outside interest in the book may spark even more interest inside your group ask for suggestions your members may appreciate your willingness to take their opinions into consideration you can either take turns choosing or you can each offer up a suggestion and take a vote read different books and compare even though you should usually read the same book in order to facilitate more discussion you can occasionally change things up by each selecting a cheap paperback romance of comparable lengths and compare notes compare the characters setting and plot points to determine what works best out of each book,Education-and-Communications

how to make bookends out of bricks,repurposing abandoned bricks into objects with a new use is something anyone can do for anyone on a budget or for those who love to think differently about the evolution of everyday objects this is a satisfying and easy project with this tutorial you ll learn how to turn boring bricks into fascinating and effective bookends that won t slide off under the pressure of your heaviest books,find suitable bricks a brick is pretty much a brick but there are some things to be wary of when choosing your bookend bricks for example be sure to use completely dry bricks before beginning the project this might mean leaving the bricks to dry somewhere first if you ve unearthed them from a wet outdoor location second avoid bricks that you can t sit evenly bricks that have chunks of mortar stuck to them or that have missing corners that make them wobbly might not be suitable for the bookend although by all means test their balance first and see if you can t knock off that mortar with a few well placed hammer knocks and of course ensure that the bricks are clean before proceeding a cloth dipped in hot soapy water and rubbed over dirt and stains should help to remove the worst of any grime build up be sure to use solid bricks not the ones with holes they may not be heavy enough and will not give you a smooth surface mor it s recommended that you make the bricks in pairs each time as clearly having one brick for each end of the bookshelf is helpful in most cases decide how you ll decorate the brick bookends there are various suitable options here depending on your own skill level the crafty items available to you and the end look you re after the decorating possibilities this article covers are paper decoupage fabric photos paint glitter and three dimensional follow the section below that suits your needs best select the paper although it may be tempting to use last year s holiday wrapping bear in mind that you ll have to live with the design year round also cheap flimsy paper is not an option even though you ll be decoupaging it the flimsier the paper the more likely it is that it ll rip and won t present a good final look the paper selected should be suitable for your décor interesting to look at and representative of your taste ideas include magazine images strong nicely designed wrapping paper images images you ve picked up from here and there such as brochures ticket stubs postcards bookmarks promotional materials etc you could even consider making a trip memory brick bookend or some other memento bookend fabric backed contact paper this comes in lots of interesting designs and colors cut outs some craft stores sell specially produced decoupage cut out sheets with designs ranging from victorian images to animals wrap each brick in a layer of plain colored paper first this will serve as the base layer over which you ll add the decoupage pieces of paper wrap as if you were wrapping a present only be as neat as you can possibly be and avoid too much overlap at either end or you ll create unevenness cut out the decoupage images if you haven t already done so cut out the images or clip them to size for adding to the brick bookend add the images to the base layer using decoupage glue glue the images all over the covered brick in a pattern or randomly as wished follow the glue instructions for drying times spray with acrylic sealer to complete the project again wait for it to dry completely once dried start using your new decoupage brick bookends create a design on paper before painting it could be as simple as painting the whole brick one simple color or even simply varnishing it clear or it could be as complicated as painting on specific designs and images or doing some free flowing painting in a random way in each case be sure to complement the décor color scheme try glow in the dark or neon paints for a funky look cover your workspace well to protect surfaces clean each brick in readiness for painting the bricks should be as clean as possible to allow the paint to adhere well paint the bricks as desired allow to dry between coats and paint enough coats for it to look smooth and well covered display once dried select the glitter and any other related adornments you could also add rhinestones costume jewels sequins and any other affordable bling that jazzes up the look cover your workspace well to protect surfaces paint decoupage glue over the brick surface except for the part that will not be seen sprinkle the glitter over the glue allow this layer to dry before adding any additional layers of glitter if adding extra bling glue on separately once the glittery layers have dried use silicon adhesive for such items for larger jewels and flash place a dab of silicon adhesive on the back and hold for a few minutes against the brick consider using fake pearls pretend money or feathers to call attention to these sparkling bookends you could even top each brick with a small tiara spray with acrylic sealer when you are finished so the glitter doesn t end up all over your books once dried the bookends are ready for display select the desired photos the photos could be themed such as a family holiday or a child growing up through the ages or simply random photos you like you will want two large pictures one on each side of the brick or four if you re creating two bricks and then two or three smaller pictures for each side of the brick determine if you want to cover the top of the brick if so find another picture use a ruler to take measurements so you know how big to print your pictures print the pictures if your pictures are cataloged on your computer print out enough pictures to cover both sides of each brick two larger pictures the two sides and top several smaller pictures use camera ready photo paper for the highest quality alternatively have a photo store print the images for you purchase or make two photo frames that are the same size as the brick you will have a framed photo on each side of the brick and then you ll decoupage the rest of the pictures onto the brick itself consider using frames that do not have stands and flat back surfaces so they can be easily affixed to the brick place the pictures inside the frames and affix to the larger sides of the brick use either liquid nails or silicone adhesive to make each frame stick hold in place for several minutes while it adheres and bonds to the brick decoupage the brick sides and top with other photos you may just like the look of the two pictures frames and stop there however if you want to add more family memories brush one layer of decoupage on a cleaned brick surface and then affix your photos wait about 20 minutes for the solution to dry and then add another layer perform this step three or four times and then spray with acrylic sealer to complete the project select the fabric as with the paper choice be sure to use fabric that is suitable year round and matches the décor of course if you re happy to change the brick bookends regularly you could also theme them to a season such as using christmas colors for the holiday season then recovering the bookends post christmas stronger fabric is advisable to prevent the likelihood of any rips or wrinkling fabric suggestions include fabric direct from your fabric stash scraps or other pieces scarves old clothing that has been loved but is no longer wearable a cozy look can be achieved by cutting up and old fluffy sweater sarongs or other clothing wraps old sheets put those childhood spiderman sheets to good use and wrap the bricks in a section that features spidey wrap each brick as though you are wrapping a gift instead of using tape to keep your work together use a dab or two of liquid nails or silicone cement you could also use a hot glue gun if you re gluing fabric to fabric in each case don t overlap the folded parts too much to ensure that the brick still sits evenly you may want to sew the edges of a cut portion of fabric so they don t fray or tear as time passes decorate if wished although optional you can add additional items to the fabric covered brick such as tying ribbon bands around each end or gluing on interesting decorations such as buttons rhinestones lace etc spray with a fabric sealant although this step is optional it will help to keep the fabric clean and make it easier to dust place the fabric brick bookends on the shelf to hold your books create a 3 d look by affixing blocks and shapes to the brick using liquid cement make a house a face your dog a car nearly any design can be made using liquid nails or silicone adhesive and found objects check out a hobby store for small dollhouse pieces re create a tiny library on the outside of each brick by purchasing a dollhouse bookshelf chair and even a few doll book glue the bookshelf to the back of the brick and then affix the chair and other books to the side you could even sit a small doll in

how to make a slam book,slam books mix together the concept of a journal and old fashioned passing notes they are books that people usually pass around school or groups of friends to learn more about each other keep them positive and fun,buy a notebook or journal these don t have to be expensive and any notebook can work you could buy a simple composition notebook with lined paper inside or a journal with a fancy cover it s up to you 1 x research source the goal here is to use a book with a lot of blank pages because you will be passing it around for people to write in how many blank pages you need depends on how many people you want to pass it to and how many questions you want to ask them decorate the cover of the slam book you ll want to decorate the cover of your slam book so that people know what it is and it looks attractive this is where your personal creativity starts to come in here are some ideas for you 2 x research source use stickers or marker to write the words slam book on the cover of the notebook or journal some people also decorate their slam books with colorful stickers glitter glue and even fake gemstones use your artistic talents keep the book closed by tying a ribbon or even a string of beads around the slam book include a teacher parent or other adult if you re going to be passing a slam book around school it can be a good idea to let the teacher know what you are doing some people pass slam books around their families too you don t only have to pass it around other people your age explain the purpose of the slam book to the adult let them know that the point of a slam book is to be positive and that any negative slams are not allowed ask the adults when you can circulate it maybe you will agree to only circulate it during recess for example consider including the adult in the circulation it might be interesting to know your teacher s favorite band or ice cream for example why not create a name page you will want to create a few pages toward the front of your slam book where people should write their names in order this allows you to figure out later which people gave which answers include a list of numbers on the page that indicate how many people you want to sign the book some slam books have spaces for 10 names while others have 25 and so on if you choose 10 write the numbers 1 to 10 on the name page it depends if you are trying to keep the slam book among a small circle of friends or a larger one have each of your friends pick a number and write their name next to that number tell your friends to use that number when answering any questions you write in the slam book write a question at the top of each page this is how a classic slam book works and starts you should start by writing a question at the top of the first blank page inside the book after the name page write questions that focus on someone s likes dislikes or non embarrassing facts such as their pet s name or their favorite ice cream flavor choose questions with short answers you can also write statements that also provoke answers such as favorite music artist or last trip you took try not to be mean a slam book in its best version should be something you use to find out more about your friends including their likes and dislikes 3 x research source don t allow mean comments about this person or that that s bullying and bullying can cause serious damage to other people 4 x research source don t use your slam book for rumors or negative statements about other people when people get in trouble it s usually because they went negative in some way a good rule of thumb is never to write something in a slam book about another person that will upset them or that would upset you if it was written about you put numbers on each of the question pages if you do this it will also help people understand what they are supposed to do when they turn to each page make sure people know they are supposed to answer the question on each page sometimes there is confusion with slam books but usually once the first few people do it they tell others how it s supposed to be done and word spreads so if you have created say space for 25 names on the name page you would create a numbered list from 1 through 25 on each question page too answer you own questions first don t assume everyone knows what a slam book is you could just explain it to your friends however it may end up circulated pretty quickly among other people you haven t directly explained it to that s why answering each question as 1 yourself provides people with an example of how it s supposed to work you could also create a page toward the front of the page that says something like how this works and then explain what each person is supposed to do include the instruction that when the final number on the name page list is taken the book should be returned to you people need to know who the slam book belongs to and where to return it or you may never see it again pass the slam book to a friend here s how it works you pass the slam book to a friend and that friend is supposed to answer the questions on each page the friend should indicate they wrote the answers by writing 1 or 2 if you filled out 1 already and then their answer on each page or if you have already chosen to number each answer page they should write their answer after their number once your friend 1 answers the questions they are supposed to pass the slam book to a second friend who then answers the question on each page by writing 2 or 3 if you were 1 and then his or her answer save the slam book it will be a lot of fun to look back at your old slam books with friends as you age some people feel slam books are almost like time capsules in that they capture the vibe of a certain era you will find it interesting to look back on what you wrote years ago for example slam books have existed for decades and some news sites think it s entertaining to see what people were writing in slam books in the 1980s 5 x research source it could be fun to do a new slam book every year you could even note the year on the cover of the slam book let it become a ritual

of the front cover and paint outwards from that spot to the edges repeat on the back cover and on the spine use long even strokes so the paint is evenly distributed 3 x research source if you want to cover up a dark cover or a design in order to paint something new use white acrylic paint if you re interested in just painting the book a new color to use as a design accent choose whatever color you like best let the base coat fully dry before you do anything else depending on what kind of cover you were working with you might need to apply a second layer of paint so that none of the original color or design shows through but before you do that or move on to actually decorating and designing your book let the first coat dry completely this will keep additional paint from smearing or mixing with the base coat 4 x research source acrylic paint takes about 20 to 30 minutes to dry paint the books solid colors if you like minimalistic decor paint multiple books all the same color or use various shades to create a rainbow effect for example if your living room has blue hues throughout plain white books would look really nice or you could use a stack of 3 books and paint each one a different shade of blue 5 x research source keep your painted books on a shelf or use them throughout your house as accent pieces there s no right or wrong way to decorate with them use tape to make stripes or other patterns for a fun unique decoration apply masking tape or painters tape to the cover of the book to make different designs like diagonal stripes horizontal stripes vertical stripes squares or even a chevron pattern paint the exposed areas of the book with your paint color of choice and let it dry completely peel away the tape to reveal the completed project and then display the books somewhere you can admire the newly designed covers 6 x research source remember if you make a mistake you can always paint over it decorate the cover with a personalized design to display your artistry use the cover and or back of the book as a miniature canvas to create your own unique work of art paint a scene or use different colors shapes and techniques to create a more abstract look display your books on shelves or dressers so that their covers can be seen and admired 7 x research source it would be fun to create new cover designs for the books based on their themes and stories for example you could paint a scene from the great gatsby on the cover of that book you could even create a scene that extends over several book spines for example paint all the spines of the harry potter books to illustrate one of your favorite scenes from the series then put the books back on your bookshelf and enjoy display a favorite quote by painting it onto the front of a book it could be a quote from the book itself or simply a quote that really resonates with you use a fine tipped paintbrush to handwrite a quote onto the cover or use an actual stencil to make your letters more uniform you could still paint small designs around the quote like flowers vines stars or even people 8 x research source these books would make great gifts for someone who loves to read especially if you painted one of their favorite books and picked a quote from it to write on the front mod podge the cover with paper and paint to create a beautiful collage use different scraps of paper or images you ve cut out from a magazine arrange them on the cover and apply a coat of mod podge overtop of the images let the mod podge dry completely then use opaque paint like a watercolor or gouache paint to cover the images with a thin layer of color this will create a cool visual where you can see the collage beneath the paint but it can still match whatever color scheme you have in mind 9 x research source you could even use multiple colors of paints to highlight different images make a piece of splash art for a colorful piece you can display at home work outside if you can or lay down a large old sheet on the floor to protect it from paint use multiple colors of paint acrylic works best for this project wet a round or flat paintbrush and dip it into the paint flick it at the book to splatter paint on it repeat this action with as many different colors as you want until the book is covered with splatters 10 x research source you could also tape off a design or a quote on the cover before splatter painting it once the paint has dried remove the tape to reveal your design underneath use acrylic paint for a fast drying wallet friendly option acrylic paint is one of the more popular types of artists paints and you can find tons of colors at your local craft store it s a nice option because it dries quickly so you won t need to worry about waiting long before you can display your painted books you can use any kind of paintbrush with acrylic paint just make sure to rinse off your brush before putting it into a new color of paint 11 x research source acrylic paint is also very easy to wash off of clothes and skin choose spray paint to quickly apply color to your books choose glitter spray paint neon spray paint or regular colors of spray paint cover the entire cover and back of the book or tape off sections to spray designs onto the book hold the canister about 6 to 8 inches 15 to 20 cm from the book and press down the tip to release the paint continuously move the canister so that the book is evenly covered from top to bottom 12 x research source opt for chalk paint for a more rustic style even if you don t want to write on your books chalk paint is a fun option that will give them a charming natural look use white gray light blue or even black use a flat or bright tipped paintbrush to apply long even strokes of chalk paint over the cover apply a single coat to let some of the original cover peek through or apply 2 to 3 coats to give it a solid finish 13 x research source chalk paint doesn t have a shiny finish so if that s something you want you d be better off picking an acrylic or oil paint pick oil paints to create a vibrant design on your book oil paints take a lot longer to dry when compared to acrylic paint or spray paint but because they take so long to dry there s more time for you to modify your artwork an angle tipped paintbrush or a round tipped paint brush will allow you to create more detail in your painting rinse and dry off your paintbrush in between colors 14 x research source oil paint is a bit harder to wash off of your skin or clothes and usually requires the use of some kind of oil like baby oil or mineral oil oil paints are generally very thick and vibrant paint with watercolors to play around with color on the cover using watercolors lets you control how opaque or vibrant your painting will be wet your brush with water use any kind of paintbrush you prefer and dip it into a color on your palette try mixing different colors of paint together on the cover of the book to create different effects use more water for a more opaque color or less water for a more vibrant color 15 x research source if you like watercolors but also want a mix of acrylic paint try using gouache paint watercolors would look great on the cover or spine of a book whether you wanted to paint an actual scene like a meadow or a house or whether you just wanted to experiment with different

how to make a book safe,a hollowed out book is a clever place to hide valuables it s easy to make yours one of a kind with a personalized book choice although you probably want to pick something beautiful rather than a great read this project takes a couple hours of work for a medium sized hardcover plus a few hours to allow for drying time power tools can speed this up considerably and unlock more designs,select a hardcover book if you don t want to damage any of your own antique stores often sell unwanted old books for next to nothing make sure the book is thick and wide enough to store the objects you plan to hide the book that makes the best hiding spot has a similar subject matter and size as the other books on the shelf a boring title also helps deter people from picking it up choose a starting page for the compartment flip through the book and choose the page you d like to see on the left hand side opposite your compartment people often choose an illustration near the front of the book if you want a larger compartment you can plan to start cutting at page 1 and just leave the front cover turn one additional page once you ve chosen the starting page turn the next page over to the left you ll end up cutting this page eventually but since it will be the top page of your compartment it needs extra attention later on to keep it looking nice wrap the front section in plastic using plastic wrap or a plastic bag wrap the front cover along with all the pages on the left hand side hold it in place with tape or a loose rubber band this will protect these pages from glue wrap the back cover in plastic as well the back cover will be the base of your compartment once you re sure both ends of the book are fully covered you can shut the book if you like you may repeat the steps above and choose an end page for the compartment as well but this often looks messy by the time the project is done mix a little water into a container of white glue recommended you can use plain white glue but it s usually a little too thick to spread easily pour the glue into a cup and mix in a little water at a time until it s slightly runny usually around 80 glue 20 water 1 x research source don t overdo it as too much water may cause the pages to warp if you want to bypass these problems visit a hobby shop and purchase glue intended for jigsaw puzzles 2 x research source this should dry clear without warping glue the sides of the pages together brush on one or two thin layers of glue along the outside pages of the book on all three edges check thoroughly for drips before you continue and wipe them away with the paintbrush if the coat of glue is too thick it will take longer to dry and may add bubbles and lumps to the pages weigh down the book until the glue is dry place the book on newspaper and set several heavy objects on top of it such as paperweights or other books this pressure will help the pages dry together with minimal warping retrieve the book once the pages are firmly dried together this can take as little as one hour or as long as 24 hours in cool humid conditions if the pages are not firmly stuck together by the time the glue is dry brush on another thin coat and let dry good air circulation will speed up drying try pointing a fan so it blows across the drying paper an air purifier is even better if you happen to have one as it also removes some of the mold spores that attack old or wet books draw the secret compartment open the book to the first piece of plastic on the right hand page draw the rectangular outline of the compartment with a pencil and ruler work in long straight lines and leave a border at least ¾ inch 19 mm on all sides to prevent tears extend each line past the corners of the compartment this will help guide your cuts cut through the outline with a utility knife place the ruler along one of the lines you drew hold a sharp utility knife alongside the ruler at a 90º angle from the paper start about ½ inch 1 25 cm outside of the rectangle and bring the knife down along the line pressing down hard repeat this cut along the same line about four times then cut all other sides of the compartment the same way be patient don t try to cut through more than ¼ inch 6mm at a time rushing will create jagged edges and increase the risk of cutting yourself remove loose pages and continue cutting carefully tug out the cut paper slicing through any corners that are still attached continue cutting down along the edges of the compartment keeping it as straight as possible repeat until you reach the piece of plastic at the back of the book a typical hardcover book typically blunts three or four utility knife blades 3 x research source put in a new one each time cutting becomes difficult or this project will take all night put a piece of corrugated cardboard above the plastic to prevent you from cutting through by accident clean up the edges tug or slice off any scraps of paper along the inside edges of the compartment cut through the corners again if you need to they usually get pretty messy glue the inside of the compartment apply the same diluted glue to the inside edges of the compartment just use a thin layer and wipe up any glue that runs to the base of the hiding spot glue the top page over the compartment remember that extra page you saved at the beginning take it out of the plastic and glue this page over the top of the compartment carefully lining it up with the page beneath it this covers up the pencil marks and cut marks to line it up exactly start by lowering the edge next to the spine of the book and smooth it down with your palm glue the compartment to the base of the book unwrap the back cover and any pages you were saving lift the compartment and brush glue onto the underside then press it down over the base of the book for a fancier looking compartment glue something decorative to the base first try a square of felt or an illustrated page from the book weight down and let dry since the wet glue is not exposed to the air this time it may take several hours longer to dry than the outside did cut out the top page you don t want your compartment covered of course cut out a rectangle in that single page so it matches the pages beneath it now your book safe is ready to hold your treasures use the nail down method for paperbacks and extra thick books gluing the pages together before cutting keeps them steady but this makes deep cuts awkward and still doesn t hold a paperback in place all that well try this method instead for these projects 4 x research source take two small pieces of fiberboard or any similar scrap board and sandwich the pages you plan to cut between them hammer four finishing nails through the top board and most of the pages almost to the bottom board cut through the first layer of pages as usual and rip them out turn the top board and hollowed out pages over and secure with a weight or rubber band repeat to cut through the rest of the book the nails hold the pages in place and turning the completed pages over improves your access to each fresh page cut with a scroll saw for intricate designs use the nail down approach described above to hold the pages steady trace a design on the board as intricate as you like and cut through from one board to the other using a scroll saw preferably use a blade with a relatively low number of teeth per inch 5 x research source if you reach a turn too sharp for the scroll saw withdraw the saw and start again from an additional pilot hole 6 x research source book dust especially from old musty books can cause allergic reactions breathing problems and infections 7 x research source wear a respirator mask while cutting and work in a well ventilated area a dremel doesn t give you the same level of control but it can speed up cutting the rectangle in the basic method above 8 x research source punch out paper quickly with a hole saw drill a hole through a piece of lumber using a hole saw clamp this over the pages you want to cut with a solid piece of lumber on the other side drill a hole through the page then use that hole as a guide for your hole saw this will cut through the circle rapidly although you do need to stop frequently to remove paper from the saw and allow it to cool down 9 x research source this is the fastest option available but you are limited by the shape of your hole saw you can create larger patterns in different shapes by shifting the lumber to a different spot on the page and cutting additional overlapping circles,Education-and-Communications
how to protect hardcover book corners,do you have an old tattered book that you just hate the thought of having to throw out because you love the story perhaps you have an old college textbook that you still use as reference that needs some tlc to keep from falling apart mending your books yourself can potentially save you money not to mention it fixes your books and can prevent further damage,mend the binding first if necessary cut a four inch 10 cm piece of 2 5cm wide book mending tape for each corner to be mended place the tape diagonally across the corner of the book so that the edge away from you overlaps both the vertical and the horizontal edges of the cover the long edge closest to you overhangs the corner press firmly to eliminate any bubbles and to ensure good adhesion cut the overlapping edge twice once in line with the vertical edge and once in line with the horizontal edge leave the center flap attached to the rest of the tape note leaving the flap attached ensures that your corner will be completely covered in tape with none of the original damaged corner showing pull the center flap snugly over the corner and press to the inside of the cover pull the side flap s snugly over the edge s of the book and press firmly to eliminate bubbles and ensure good adhesion take care to avoid leaving any tunnel along the edge of the book this will only speed deterioration of the cover pull the tape snugly over the edge of the book repeat for all damaged corners or for any corners you wish to protect cut a piece of tape equal in length to the width of your book plus three to four inches 6 10cm fold the tape strip in half with sticky side facing out cut a half inch 1 5cm angled snip into one edge of the tape tear or cut off the resulting tab place the tape on the spine of the book so that the bottom of the u shaped divot is 1 4 inch 5mm above the end of the spine press the tape firmly against the spine wrap the tape around the edge of the book and into the gutter press firmly into the gutter press the tape out beyond the gutter onto the book cover itself eliminate bubbles to ensure good adhesion repeat for opposite side with the book on its edge open both covers pull the flaps of tape firmly and snugly down over the edges of the cover near the spine take care not to leave any tunnel of air between the tape and book edge pull the covers slightly in the direction away from the book to stretch the mending tape slightly and allow you to roll down the center of the divot into a folded rolled edge note book tape in a single layer tears fairly easily tape folded onto itself in two layers not only looks neat but will stay clean and will not rip easily repeat for any other spine ends that need reinforcement or protection,Education-and-Communications

how to make bookends out of bricks,repurposing abandoned bricks into objects with a new use is something anyone can do for anyone on a budget or for those who love to think differently about the evolution of everyday objects this is a satisfying and easy project with this tutorial you ll learn how to turn boring bricks into fascinating and effective bookends that won t slide off under the pressure of your heaviest books,find suitable bricks a brick is pretty much a brick but there are some things to be wary of when choosing your bookend bricks for example be sure to use completely dry bricks before beginning the project this might mean leaving the bricks to dry somewhere first if you ve unearthed them from a wet outdoor location second avoid bricks that you can t sit evenly bricks that have chunks of mortar stuck to them or that have missing corners that make them wobbly might not be suitable for the bookend although by all means test their balance first and see if you can t knock off that mortar with a few well placed hammer knocks and of course ensure that the bricks are clean before proceeding a cloth dipped in hot soapy water and rubbed over dirt and stains should help to remove the worst of any grime build up be sure to use solid bricks not the ones with holes they may not be heavy enough and will not give you a smooth surface mor it s recommended that you make the bricks in pairs each time as clearly having one brick for each end of the bookshelf is helpful in most cases decide how you ll decorate the brick bookends there are various suitable options here depending on your own skill level the crafty items available to you and the end look you re after the decorating possibilities this article covers are paper decoupage fabric photos paint glitter and three dimensional follow the section below that suits your needs best select the paper although it may be tempting to use last year s holiday wrapping bear in mind that you ll have to live with the design year round also cheap flimsy paper is not an option even though you ll be decoupaging it the flimsier the paper the more likely it is that it ll rip and won t present a good final look the paper selected should be suitable for your décor interesting to look at and representative of your taste ideas include magazine images strong nicely designed wrapping paper images images you ve picked up from here and there such as brochures ticket stubs postcards bookmarks promotional materials etc you could even consider making a trip memory brick bookend or some other memento bookend fabric backed contact paper this comes in lots of interesting designs and colors cut outs some craft stores sell specially produced decoupage cut out sheets with designs ranging from victorian images to animals wrap each brick in a layer of plain colored paper first this will serve as the base layer over which you ll add the decoupage pieces of paper wrap as if you were wrapping a present only be as neat as you can possibly be and avoid too much overlap at either end or you ll create unevenness cut out the decoupage images if you haven t already done so cut out the images or clip them to size for adding to the brick bookend add the images to the base layer using decoupage glue glue the images all over the covered brick in a pattern or randomly as wished follow the glue instructions for drying times spray with acrylic sealer to complete the project again wait for it to dry completely once dried start using your new decoupage brick bookends create a design on paper before painting it could be as simple as painting the whole brick one simple color or even simply varnishing it clear or it could be as complicated as painting on specific designs and images or doing some free flowing painting in a random way in each case be sure to complement the décor color scheme try glow in the dark or neon paints for a funky look cover your workspace well to protect surfaces clean each brick in readiness for painting the bricks should be as clean as possible to allow the paint to adhere well paint the bricks as desired allow to dry between coats and paint enough coats for it to look smooth and well covered display once dried select the glitter and any other related adornments you could also add rhinestones costume jewels sequins and any other affordable bling that jazzes up the look cover your workspace well to protect surfaces paint decoupage glue over the brick surface except for the part that will not be seen sprinkle the glitter over the glue allow this layer to dry before adding any additional layers of glitter if adding extra bling glue on separately once the glittery layers have dried use silicon adhesive for such items for larger jewels and flash place a dab of silicon adhesive on the back and hold for a few minutes against the brick consider using fake pearls pretend money or feathers to call attention to these sparkling bookends you could even top each brick with a small tiara spray with acrylic sealer when you are finished so the glitter doesn t end up all over your books once dried the bookends are ready for display select the desired photos the photos could be themed such as a family holiday or a child growing up through the ages or simply random photos you like you will want two large pictures one on each side of the brick or four if you re creating two bricks and then two or three smaller pictures for each side of the brick determine if you want to cover the top of the brick if so find another picture use a ruler to take measurements so you know how big to print your pictures print the pictures if your pictures are cataloged on your computer print out enough pictures to cover both sides of each brick two larger pictures the two sides and top several smaller pictures use camera ready photo paper for the highest quality alternatively have a photo store print the images for you purchase or make two photo frames that are the same size as the brick you will have a framed photo on each side of the brick and then you ll decoupage the rest of the pictures onto the brick itself consider using frames that do not have stands and flat back surfaces so they can be easily affixed to the brick place the pictures inside the frames and affix to the larger sides of the brick use either liquid nails or silicone adhesive to make each frame stick hold in place for several minutes while it adheres and bonds to the brick decoupage the brick sides and top with other photos you may just like the look of the two pictures frames and stop there however if you want to add more family memories brush one layer of decoupage on a cleaned brick surface and then affix your photos wait about 20 minutes for the solution to dry and then add another layer perform this step three or four times and then spray with acrylic sealer to complete the project select the fabric as with the paper choice be sure to use fabric that is suitable year round and matches the décor of course if you re happy to change the brick bookends regularly you could also theme them to a season such as using christmas colors for the holiday season then recovering the bookends post christmas stronger fabric is advisable to prevent the likelihood of any rips or wrinkling fabric suggestions include fabric direct from your fabric stash scraps or other pieces scarves old clothing that has been loved but is no longer wearable a cozy look can be achieved by cutting up and old fluffy sweater sarongs or other clothing wraps old sheets put those childhood spiderman sheets to good use and wrap the bricks in a section that features spidey wrap each brick as though you are wrapping a gift instead of using tape to keep your work together use a dab or two of liquid nails or silicone cement you could also use a hot glue gun if you re gluing fabric to fabric in each case don t overlap the folded parts too much to ensure that the brick still sits evenly you may want to sew the edges of a cut portion of fabric so they don t fray or tear as time passes decorate if wished although optional you can add additional items to the fabric covered brick such as tying ribbon bands around each end or gluing on interesting decorations such as buttons rhinestones lace etc spray with a fabric sealant although this step is optional it will help to keep the fabric clean and make it easier to dust place the fabric brick bookends on the shelf to hold your books create a 3 d look by affixing blocks and shapes to the brick using liquid cement make a house a face your dog a car nearly any design can be made using liquid nails or silicone adhesive and found objects check out a hobby store for small dollhouse pieces re create a tiny library on the outside of each brick by purchasing a dollhouse bookshelf chair and even a few doll book glue the bookshelf to the back of the brick and then affix the chair and other books to the side you could even sit a small doll in

how to fold a book into art,if you re artistically inclined you can do a lot more with old books than just read them one elegant example is hand folded book art which makes it possible to transform the pages of an ordinary book into a beautiful three dimensional conversation piece to get started all you need is a thick book with lots of pages a print out of a simple word phrase or design and a little patience,choose a word or shape to turn into a 3d book sculpture this could be someone s name a meaningful phrase or a word that has some special significance to you like love family magic or tacos you also have the option of folding some kind of simple shape such as a heart star or butterfly or a taco 1 x research source try to limit words and phrases to no more than about 8 letters any longer than that and they may be difficult or even impossible to pull off because of the way the book s pages must be manipulated you ll only be able to make shapes with solid continuous outlines that means things like peace signs complex symbols and logos are a no go unfortunately basic shapes may be easier to pull off than words on your first attempt since they tend to have fewer contours select a book that s thick enough to make the design you want to fold it can take anywhere from 200 400 pages to form short words monograms and most shapes for longer words or short phrases you ll probably need closer to 600 700 pages or slightly more ideally you ll want to use a hardcover book that will have an easier time standing up on its own 2 x research source if you re not sure exactly how large a book you need err on the side of caution and go big it s better to have too many pages than too few you ll be folding thin sections of the book s pages at various points to bring your design to life so it s a good idea to pick out a title that you don t think you ll want to read again in the future create and print out a template of your chosen word open up your preferred word processor program and type out the word you want to use for your project while formatting your text feel free to play around with different fonts for more of a personalized style when you re happy with your design hit the print button and commit it to paper 4 x research source for best results set the size of your font to at least 200 dpi dots per inch your text should be big enough to be plainly readable across the pages of your book when it s opened slightly 5 x research source applying a narrow wave or pinstripe effect to the text on your template page can provide you with handy little guidelines to follow when it comes time to make your folds print your template landscape style for longer words and shapes and portrait style for short words initials and symmetrical outlines mark the top of your book s pages 1 1 1 4 in 2 5 3 2 cm from the spine with the book shut tightly run the tip of a pencil light colored marker or ink pen across the upper part of the pages from cover to cover then turn it over and do the same on the bottom this mark will indicate how deep you should make your folds to ensure that the book will stay open properly 6 x research source a pencil will work better than a pen or marker if neatness is a priority as you ll be able to erase the markings later you can also use a utility knife or razor blade to lightly score the pages if there happens to be one in your craft supplies and you don t have a writing utensil handy just be careful as both of these tools are extremely sharp 7 x research source crease the top of your template paper into a 1 in 2 5 cm lip bend back the uppermost portion of the paper until it s about as wide as a quarter then lay it down flat and slide your finger over the bend to make it permanent make sure that the lip is running in the same direction as your word or design 8 x research source this lip will allow you to secure the template page to the edge of your book which will in turn help guarantee that each of the folds you make line up perfectly hook the lip of the template onto the book just behind the first page gather up a thin section of pages and slide the template over the leaves about 1 2 inch 1 3 cm from their outer corner then lower the section back down to rejoin the rest of the book and sandwich the template in place you re now ready to get folding 9 x research source keep in mind that the edge of your design needs to be visible in order to serve as an effective guide for best results format the design on your template page so that there s 1 2 in 2 5 5 1 cm of blank space on either side fold the top and bottom of the first page to the starting point on your template starting at the upper corner fold the page toward you until the edge of the fold touches the edge of your design crease the fold firmly to help it hold its shape then make a second fold at the page s lower corner 10 x research source when you re done the edges of both folds should meet at a precise angle like an arrow pointing towards your reference point you can also fold the pages backwards away from you if you prefer though this may be slightly more time consuming whichever way you decide on stick with it that way the rest of your folds will all be consistent mark the site of your first fold on your template page take your writing utensil and draw a small line at the spot along your design where the folded page ends this notch will make it clear where your last fold was in case you get off track lose your focus or have to stop for any reason 11 x research source marking your progress on your template page will make it much easier to keep up with where you are in the process and enable you to work with greater precision 12 x research source pick a point just past your original starting point and make your second fold slide your template page a fraction of an inch towards the spine of the book to set a new point to align your next fold with the exact distance you move the sheet is up to you but it s best not to shift it more than about 1 2 cm 0 20 in 13 x research source the more folds you make in total the smoother the edges of your design will be on the flip side if you move the template page over too far each time you ll end up with an outline that has a rough choppy look continue folding marking and moving along your design from here on it s simply a matter of working your way down the template page until you get to the far edge of the word or shape you re creating take your time and focus on making each fold meticulous folding hundreds of pages can be a painstaking task but if you re patient you ll be rewarded with a one of a kind piece of craft art 14 x research source to avoid fatigue and prevent your project from becoming monotonous tackle it a little bit at a time fold for 30 minutes to an hour then take a break and come back to it later on and pick it up for another half an hour and so on 15 x research source stand the book upright to show off your completed design when you ve finished folding your final page whew all that s left to do is put the fruits of your labor on display just prop the book up on its bottom surface and open it up adjust the angle formed by the front and back covers and the spacing of the pages as needed to make your design easier to see 16 x research source if you used a softcover book and are having a hard time getting it to stay standing cut a couple pieces of cardboard to the same height and width as the book and insert them behind the front and back covers to lend some extra support 17 x research source embellish your book with decorative paper items to impress even more if you want to add a little extra flair to your homespun book art take some time to fold a few origami accents and arrange them around the upper part of the folded pages where they slant towards your design they ll lend an element of wonder and whimsy while also filling up blank space and giving the eye more to settle on 18 x research source flowers snowflakes pinwheels animals and miniature paper airplanes can all make quaint book ornaments 19 x research source if the idea of origami isn t very appealing after all the folding you ve been doing

study the writer s brief if you are contracted to illustrate a book oftentimes writers will provide you with a brief a list of notes suggesting the main actions in each spread of the book study this carefully and try to remain faithful to the author s intentions if you are illustrating your own book you have unlimited creative license 1 x research source tailor images based on reading level different age ranges of readers require different kinds of illustrations if you are writing for very young children each major plot movement may need to be portrayed in your illustrations in obvious and easy to follow ways slightly older readers who can read most or all of the story themselves however may only require illustrations that portray central themes and moments in a chapter 2 x research source gain inspiration from the work of other artists there s no shame in consulting the styles of other successful children s books for ideas additionally look to other forms of art such as paintings textiles or film to get ideas for the general aesthetic of your images 3 x research source if you re writing for younger audiences the works of dr seuss might be a great place to start his whimsical and original style paved the way for a great deal of other children s artists try to look at art related to the setting of your story for example if you re illustrating a tale about knights and castles you should try researching art from the middle ages draw thumbnail sketches of the book these small un detailed sketches only a square inch or two in size will allow you to trace out the visual flow of the whole book there s no need to erase or revise these just quickly draw and let your ideas flow focus on landscape design focal points and general scene layout 4 x research source draw some study sketches of your story focus on character development exploring a range of potential expressions postures and moods for each character you intend to illustrate you can use these as references throughout the whole illustration process 5 x research source for example if your main character begins the book in a sad state and ends happy try drawing him or her in both poles of emotion developing intermediate expressions in between create a sketching template each illustration you produce will eventually cover one or two pages of a physical book so it s important to match the dimensions of your sketch with those of your final product try creating a precise grid with a pencil and a ruler on your sketch paper before sketching your scenes 6 x research source if your illustrations cover two pages make sure to mark the area occupied by the spine of the book and avoid sketching important details in this space make sure to determine where the author intends to place the text on each page mark these areas with a grid and avoid sketching over them with details work with the text your illustrations should seamlessly follow the plot of the book as printed on each page try to capture details portrayed in the story and look for ways to subtly foreshadow events in coming pages with your images 7 x research source check for consistency make sure each of your characters are easily identifiable across the entire book check for consistent clothing coloration and expressions if characters are hard for children to identify across multiple spreads they may struggle to follow the plot of the book 8 x research source share your sketches with your client if you are illustrating for a client be sure and run your sketches by them before proceeding at this stage images are relatively easy to alter or replace and it is important to have the author s full approval and feedback before you move on to painting prepare final sketches of each spread using your study sketches for reference resize your images to their target size and add any extra details objects textures or scenery you want to put in the illustration to scale accurately try creating a measured grid over your study sketches and simply reproduce them one quadrant at a time in a larger grid scaled to your final dimensions 9 x research source transfer your sketches to watercolor paper before you bring your sketches to life with paint you will need to transfer them to the appropriate paper for a simple solution try photocopying your sketches directly onto watercolor paper using a printer if your printer is unable to handle heavy watercolor paper try a traditional charcoal transfer rub the back of your sketching paper with charcoal attach it charcoal side down to your watercolor paper and retrace the image upon removing the sketch paper you should be left with a carbon copy of your original sketch on the watercolor paper 10 x research source determine your colors before painting whip up a quick thumbnail study of your color palette the colors of a children s book can contribute as much to the mood and feel of the work as design of the drawings so make sure to consult with the author concerning the book s hues bright vibrant colors often convey cheerful emotions while dark amber and dark blues can give your illustrations a more somber feel paint with a watercolor brush if you are new to painting with watercolors you may want to produce some extra carbon copies for practice before attempting your final piece remember painting with watercolors takes a lighter touch than other forms of painting brush lightly and practice with multiple drafts to develop your skills 11 x research source define your lines with a pen for extra contrast definition and pop add pen outlines to some or all of your lines to prevent bleeding try using a pen with waterproof ink for a more comic like feel with harder firmer edges try outlining your lines with ink before painting and simply filling in the lines remember ink is optional if you are aiming for whimsical abstract feel limiting your outlines or leaving them out altogether are both viable options 12 x

how to illustrate a book,are you a natural artist good with a pencil or paints then you may want to illustrate a book someday there are several steps you can take to successfully accomplish this

be valuable to do unpaid jobs which will help you build up for portfolio if you wish to be paid for your work try contacting anyone you know in the business of publishing or editing books to see if they can help point you in the right direction you can also contact a publishing company by phone or letter in doing this you may get a chance to have your portfolio considered you are likely to be rejected many times so be persistent meet with the art director this may be via phone or email or it may be in person regardless this is the time to agree upon deadlines any special requirements of the author your timetable and availability or any other questions you might have 1 x research source you will repeat this step many times throughout the process you will need to show the author s and publishers samples of what you have so far in order to agree that it is moving in the right direction read drafts when you finally do find someone in need of your services they will give you either one or many options of different novels and books you must of course read a draft or if the story is a reprint read the original book previous to the reprint you may be lucky enough to have the opportunity do a cover or dust jacket design you must make sure you thoroughly understand the plot and its characters remember their emotions are expressed through your art meet with the author if you have agreed that you enjoy the story and that you would like to illustrate it you should meet with the author to discuss and agree upon a number of things such as the cover and whether or not you will illustrate it which pages should be illustrated what kind of media you will use i e what kind of illustrations you are going to make etc sign a contract after you ve met with the author and agreed on the details you will need to sign a contract that specifies all the details of your agreement with the publishing company and or author 2 x research source make sure the contract includes pertinent information such as when you should be finished and how much you should be paid make sure to get a copy of the contract which includes the signatures of all involved parties and the date it was signed begin the process of illustration how this step proceeds depends on how you as an artist prefer to work some illustrators like to begin with making some pencil sketches of the ideas they have in their head comparing them and getting feedback from friends and family 3 x research source while others just free draw however you do it you need to start coming up with a solid idea of what each character will look like and what the style of the illustrations will be your method for illustrating may be completely different and that is ok if you are successfully creating illustrations there is no reason to try to change anything refine your drawings once you have come up with a sketch that fits with the guidelines of the publisher these will be different for every publisher and probably every job you will need to come up with rough sketches for each required page that you will review with the author publishers sometimes it can be hard to receive feedback from others especially if it is critical however you should try not to take this personally they only want the book to be as good as it can be revise your illustrations based on the feedback of the authors you should do your best to revise them so that all parties can be happy with the end product 4 x research source be sure that the illustrations will fit the dimensions of the book if you draw the image too big parts of the image will be missing from the book and the effect may not be the same 5 x research source finish your illustrations after what is likely to be several rounds of feedback on your work you will be able to complete a final illustration you will then send these to the publisher where the sketches and the story will be put together to create the final product 6 x research source find a book you want to illustrate perhaps you ve already got a story in mind or maybe not if not read several different books and pick one that you really enjoy if the story paints a vivid picture in your mind it will be easier to come up with sketches regardless of what book you choose make sure you spend plenty of time reading and analyzing the story try to imagine what the author pictured when it was written try to imagine how you would draw the picture as you are reading and re reading the story another option is to write a story of your own many writers enjoy the process of both writing and illustrating one advantage of this is that if you write your own story you know exactly what the author is trying to portray which makes it easier to portray the story in images begin sketching images after you ve chosen or written the book you want to illustrate you can begin sketching pictures of the setting the scenery etc it may be helpful to take notes of what you ve sketched so far with what characters and in what settings so that you can keep track throughout the book especially if the book is a long one it may be hard to remember the details of what you sketched in an earlier part of the book if you re not sure exactly what the characters and style should look like try sketching out several different ideas so you can see them on paper or computer decide on a style once you ve completed some rough sketches of different ideas you have you can choose a style that you will stick with throughout the book since this is for your own enjoyment the style can be any you choose however it is often a good idea to choose a style that matches with the book for example if the book is about drama and murder you probably won t be using a lot of bright colors instead in this case you might consider using darker more muted shading and less cartoonish characters if you re illustrating a children s book on the other hand you don t want to draw characters that will frighten children draw and redraw each image since you are not doing this as a paid job you can proceed with the process of illustration as you like draw images for each scene you find interesting or for each page of the book draw and redraw the scenes as much as you like add color or keep the illustrations as simple pencil sketches these choices are completely yours if you are doing this in order to build up a portfolio you should try to work towards creating a style that is unique to you 7 x research source if you want to improve your illustrations you can also ask for lots of feedback from friends and family too they may have ideas you hadn t previously thought of 8 x research source scan your images into the computer if you have drawn all your images by hand you can scan the images into your computer where you can add the images to the story alternatively if you have chosen a book that you are unable to edit on the computer you can simply put the drawings into the book where you wanted to include them this way they will be in the story next time you read it 9 x research source consider sharing your work if you think you might one day want to become a published illustrator consider sharing your work these days it is very common for illustrators to post their portfolio online there are many websites that will let you create your own blog for free simply search on google for free blogging websites make sure the site you choose will easily allow you to share your link with friends you can also create a physical portfolio if you wish there are many ways to do this but if you plan to present it to potential clients make sure that it looks clean and professional,Education-and-Communications

how to write a book summary,writing a summary of a book is a great way for you to absorb what you re reading it also gives you a quick reference you can use to remember the main points of the book anytime you need it to write a good summary read the book carefully while taking notes on important ideas plot twists and main characters you can then use your notes to draft and then proofread your awesome summary,annotate the text as you read annotating as you read will help you find important passages easily while you are writing the summary circle highlight or note anything that s confusing important surprising or interesting you can also mark repetition inconsistencies and connections between passages 1 x research source if the book belongs to you feel free to highlight passages and write in it if the book doesn t belong to you use sticky notes to mark the passages instead write notes while you re reading keep a notebook next to you while you read so you can jot down your thoughts taking notes as you read will allow you to record things correctly this will create less work for you than if you try to go back and check on details later 2 x research source it might be a good idea to keep several different pieces of paper next to you for notes one can be for general impressions and quick thoughts another can be for lists of characters and events and one more for recording the book s major themes and ideas you can also take notes to keep track of words you don t recognize use a dictionary to look these up as you go and then write down the definitions underlining and highlighting the book will not only permanently damage it but it also won t help you keep track of specific details keep a running list of the main characters write down the main characters names and a brief description of their personalities or major characteristics include a line or two about each of the main characters desires and goals use these notes to think about how the characters illustrate the main themes of the book you can also make a timeline of the major events that occur in the book especially if the chronology is complicated or confusing keep multiple timelines if the story jumps back and forth between different plotlines break the book down into sections to keep yourself from getting overwhelmed think about the book in three parts the story will have a beginning middle and end organize your notes based on these sections the beginning will be focused on introducing the major characters and establishing the setting of the story the middle will explore the major problem of the book whether it s a fight between good and evil or a murder mystery the end will resolve the book s major problem identify the main point of each section each section should have a specific theme and purpose think about what the author spends the most time on in each section be sure to also consider how the sections relate to one another determine the book s one key idea as you re reading think about what lesson the book is trying to teach notice what theme comes up again and again it might be something that the characters always talk about or a fatal flaw in people that causes problem after problem for example the author may want to show readers that pride leads people to make bad decisions to demonstrate this the main character keeps getting themselves into situations that are above their head because they re prideful and arrogant if you re reading a nonfiction book the main idea might be something about history or society maybe the author wants to show readers that fast food is unhealthy and the book brings up lots of examples to prove that point check if there are length requirements for your summary if you re writing your summary for a school assignment there will probably be a limit to how much or little you can write make your summary as close to that limit as possible too short will make it seem like you didn t read the book and too long could mean that you re not really writing a summary 3 x research source for example if your word limit is 200 write between about 190 and 200 words even if you re writing a summary for your own use consider keeping it on the short side having a summary under 500 words gives you a quick and easy reference tool write the summary in chronological order a summary should present the events in the sequence that they happened avoid jumping around between different parts of the book begin at the beginning and end at the ending to maintain the integrity of the original story describe the major plot points and characters start by introducing the title and author of the book and then briefly describe what happened in the book this should only take a few sentences think of it as your introduction you could say something like j k rowling s harry potter and the sorcerer s stone tells the story of a young orphaned boy who discovers he s a wizard he learns that there is a whole wizarding world full of good bad witches and wizards during his first year as a student at hogwarts explain the main points of the book s sections use your notes to summarize how the book unfolds spend a few sentences explaining what happens in each section how they build on each other and why the section is important to the overall point of the book this part of the summary might look like the first part of the book introduces the reader to what it s like to be a wizard the reader experiences how amazing this is with harry himself who s new to this world as well as the story goes on it s clear that something dark is happening at hogwarts and harry needs his new friends ron and hermione to figure out what it is the end of the book focuses on a series of tests and trials that harry could not make it through without relying on friendship and his mother s love conclude by stating the book s key idea finish your summary by stating what you feel is the lesson of the book refer back to your notes to remind yourself what theme came up again and again this statement should be the last sentence of the summary for example rowling used her story to show that even talented people need friendship and love to overcome evil don t include your opinion in the summary the summary should be a neutral description of the book focus on the facts of the story don t write about how the book makes you feel or whether you agree or disagree with the author for instance you could say both professor quirrell and lord voldemort disappear after failing to obtain the sorcerer s stone instead of it really sucks that voldemort escapes because he is the worst and the author should have made sure he was captured proofread to check for mistakes make sure you ve spelled everything correctly read the summary out loud to find grammatical errors or misplaced commas double check your word count 4 x research source don t rely on spell check as it can t account for context and won t catch grammatical errors like misuse of there their and they re you may be writing your summary for a book club or your own use while editing isn t as big a deal in these cases you ll still want your summary to make sense give it a quick read over to make sure it s clearly written share your work with a buddy especially if this is for school it s a great idea to have a friend or family member read over your work they ll catch any mistakes you ve missed if you ask a fellow student you can exchange summaries to help each other out find a quiet place to read without distractions pick a spot away from the tv turn your phone on silent and put it aside so it doesn t tempt you focus just on the book and enjoy the time you re about to spend reading you should also make sure you re near a lamp or a window so you don t strain your eyes while reading read the book in small blocks to keep yourself from getting overwhelmed read in 20 minute sessions if you really enjoy the book you can read for an hour or two at a time this will allow you to process the book slowly set aside enough time if you re on a deadline you don t want to stay up all night trying to read the book and write the summary all at once plan to take at least two weeks for shorter books and about a month for longer books take a little time every day to read if this is for a school assignment or book club start reading as soon as the book is assigned your teacher or group leader has probably calculated the exact amount of weeks you ll need to finish the book and write the summary without stressing out over it re read important passages important passages should be easy to spot if you notice that a main character is having a major realization or there s a sudden plot twist re read those paragraphs in the book 5 x research source these passages usually won t be focused on description instead they ll cover a turning point in the plot a tragic event or the resolution of some conflict pay careful attention to the main characters the main characters will be the ones whose actions mistakes and feelings tell you the key points of the book read especially carefully when they come up in the text 6 x research source don t get distracted by small details when you re writing a summary you aren t supposed to include little details about secondary characters descriptions or minor plot points while you should still read these parts of the book and pay attention to them they generally don t have a central role in a summary,Education-and-Communications
how to write a book review,writing a book review is not just about summarizing it s also an opportunity for you to present a critical discussion of the book so others get an idea of what to expect whether you re writing a review as an assignment or as a publication opportunity you should combine an accurate analytical reading with a strong personal touch an effective book review describes what is on the page analyzes how the book tried to achieve its purpose and expresses any reactions and arguments from a unique perspective,read the book and take notes if possible read the book multiple times as repeat reads tend to lead a reader or reviewer to view aspects of the story the setting and the character s in a new or different way write down notes in a notebook or use a voice recorder to document any thoughts or impressions you have of the book as you are reading they don t have to be organised or perfect the idea is to brainstorm any impressions you may have of the book try summarizing the major sections of the book you re reviewing to help understand how it s structured think about the book s genre and or field of study consider how the book fits or does not fit in its genre or field of study if necessary use outside sources to familiarize yourself with the field of study and the genre of the book for example if you are reviewing a non fiction book about the development of the polio vaccine in the 1950s consider reading other books that also examine the same scientific issue and or period of scientific development or if you are reviewing a work of fiction like nathaniel hawthorne s the scarlet letter consider how hawthorne s book relates to other 19th century works of romanticism and historical fiction set in the same time period the 17th century as points of comparison determine the major arguments and themes of the book the theme is often a lesson or overall message that the reader perceives between the lines the theme can also consist of the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a book authors may present multiple themes in their writing especially works of fiction these themes will help support the argument that the book is making pay attention to the preface any quotes and or references in the book s introduction as this content will likely shed light on the book s major themes and viewpoint a simple way to determine one of the major themes of a book is to sum up the book in one word or sentence 1 x research source so for example the major theme of the scarlet letter could be sin once you have your one word summary stretch the single word into a message or lesson such as sin can lead to knowledge but it can also lead to suffering consider the author s writing style ask yourself if the style suits the book s intended audience remember that genre is a category of writing and style is the manner in which a subject is expressed or performed 2 x research source so depending on the style used the author can present different viewpoints to the intended audience for example in the scarlet letter hawthorne attempts to combine the writing style of the romantic period 1800 1855 with the common everyday language of the american puritans of the 1600s hawthorne does this with long descriptive sentences that are strung together with commas and semicolons 3 x research source think about how well the author develops the major areas or points in the book what areas are covered not covered why locating gaps in the timeframe or character development in fiction or the coverage and analysis in nonfiction can help you think critically as well noticing any well developed elements of the book will help you create good points for your review make note of the book s format if relevant elements like the book s layout binding typography etc can provide framing and context for the book if the author provides secondary material like maps charts and drawings always consider how they support or contribute to the book s themes and arguments in the scarlet letter for example hawthorne begins the book with an introduction to the text narrated by an individual who has many autobiographical details in common with the author in the introduction the nameless narrator tells the story of finding the manuscript bundled in a scarlet letter a hawthorne uses this narrative framing to create a story within a story an important detail when discussing the book as a whole consider any literary devices in the book if the book is a work of fiction think about how plot structure is developed in the story take notes on the book s character plot setting symbols mood or tone and how they relate to the overall theme of the book if we were to use the scarlett letter again it would be important to note that hawthorne chose the adulterer and sinner hester prynne as his protagonist and placed the religious anti sin reverend wilson in the role of antagonist in writing a review of the scarlet letter it would be useful to consider why hawthorne did this and how it relates back to the book s overall theme of sin think about how unique the book is does it add new information to a genre the author may be trying to challenge or expand the existing rules and norms of a genre consider how the book does this and how this may affect the intended audience s reception of the book assess how successful the book is was the author successful in carrying out the overall purposes of the book and did you feel satisfied with the book s ending would you recommend this book to others begin with a heading most reviews start off with a heading that includes all the bibliographic information about the book if you haven t been directed on heading format from an editor or professor use the standard heading of title author place of publication publisher date of publication and number of pages write an introduction a good introduction will grab the reader s attention so they are interested in reading the rest of the review and will inform the reader what the review is going to be about 4 x research source ensure your introduction contains relevant details like the author s background and if applicable their previous work in the genre 5 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students

detail about what happens from the middle of the book onwards 11 x research source as well if the book is part of a series you can mention this to potential readers and situate the book within the series 12 x research source evaluate and critique the book once you have summarized the book and discussed the main themes and aspects shift into your critical analysis this the heart of your review so be as direct and clear as you can use the answers you brainstormed during your preparation for the review to formulate your critique address how well the book has achieved its goal how the book compares to other books on the subject specific points that were not convincing or lacked development and what personal experiences if any you ve had related to the subject of the book always use properly cited supporting quotes and passages from the book to back up your critical discussion this not only reinforces your viewpoint with a trustworthy source it also gives the reader a sense of the writing style and narrative voice of the book 13 x research source the general rule of thumb is that the first one half to two thirds of the review should summarize the author s main ideas and at least one third should evaluate the book wrap up the review write a concluding paragraph or several sentences that sum up your critical analysis of the book if your critical position has been well argued the conclusion should follow naturally examine the strengths and weaknesses of the book and discuss whether or not you would recommend the book to others if so who do you think is the ideal audience for the book 14 x research source do not introduce new material in your conclusion or discuss a new idea or impression that was not examined in your introduction and body paragraphs 15 x

be as perfect as you d like so feel free to revise and adjust your draft to gain perspective put the review aside for a few days and then come back to it with fresh eyes always use spell check and

directions before you begin the assignment should give you a list of specific questions that you need to answer in your response becoming familiar with the questions before you begin the assignment will help you know what to look for and think about as you read if the questions are not specified use the following questions to guide your reading 1 x research source do you like or dislike the text can you identify the author s purpose do you agree or disagree with the author does the text relate to you and your life if so how if not why not does the text agree with or go against your personal world view what if anything did you learn from the text read the text to write a good reader response paper it is important to read the text fully and carefully take your time and think about how the text is making you feel and why take lots of notes bookmark important passages that you think you might use when you write your response or write down page numbers of key sections taking a bit of extra time during this phase will save you a lot of time in the writing process 2 x research source contemplate what you have read before you begin writing it is helpful to take some time to think about the text as a whole and formulate an overall impression of the work did you love it did you hate it is there something about it that really bothered you or really spoke to you completing some or all of these sample statements can help you with this process after reading the text 3 x research source i think that i feel that i see that i have learned that identify an angle you can take when talking about the text a good reader response paper must have a clear thesis statement or overall argument if the assignment specified a central question to focus on in your response the answer to that question should become your thesis statement if not your thesis should address you overall impression of the book 4 x research source an example thesis statement might look like the following even though i found the scarlett letter hard to follow at times hester prynne s story is still relatable and made me think a lot about the effects of publicly shaming people online some people believe the old man and the sea is a book about failure but it is really a story of perseverance that teaches us that success may not always come in the form we expect and even disasters can lead to positive outcomes outline the essay you will need to follow the directions for your specific assignment but most reader response papers are about 2 3 pages long and use the following general outline introduction 1 paragraph analysis body paragraphs 3 4 paragraphs how you organize these paragraphs will depend on the parameters of the assignment conclusion 1 paragraph choose example passages to use in your analysis these should support your thesis statement and provide clear examples of the kinds of things you want to talk about in your analysis is there a key bit of dialogue that really captures the protagonist s personality is there a scene that reminded you of something from your personal life or taught you how you might handle a specific situation write the introduction make sure that the introduction clearly specifies the name of both the text and the author it should also include some description of the text and what it s about the introduction should end with your thesis statement or argument write the body paragraphs you should write 3 4 paragraphs that discuss the text and the reading questions in depth you don t necessarily have to answer each question in order multiple questions can be combined and addressed in a single paragraph or reordered in a way that flows well and makes sense to you 5 x research source it is often helpful to use the first body paragraph to include more information about the text the plotline major themes etc and then use the rest of the paragraphs to provide an analysis of how you felt about the text remember to explain how why and what as you write your paper think about explaining not just how you felt about the text but why it made you feel a certain way chapter 2 made me feel uncomfortable 3 because don t just state that the text taught you a lot give an example of something you actually learned i learned that sometimes we don t realize how our actions affect others remember that a reader response is meant to be personal so it s ok to incorporate personal anecdotes and opinions into your analysis example forcing hester prynne to wear the scarlet a reminded me of a time when i was cyber bullied in eighth grade and my friends spread rumors about me online where the whole school could see incorporate specific examples into your analysis each body paragraph should include at least 1 2 specific examples from the text these don t all have to be direct quotations for example you might simply describe a particular event or passage in the text example at the end of the old man and the sea manolin promises to once again fish with santiago so the old man no longer has to be alone this was santiago s greatest wish but it was a different kind of success than he initially set out to achieve keep quotations short and sweet resist the temptation to string together multiple multi line quotes and make sure to include at least one sentence after each quote explaining how it relates to the point you are making example my big fish must be somewhere said santiago this is exactly how i felt after i received my third rejection letter but like santiago i kept trying and eventually i was accepted make sure and cite your examples per class directions you will usually be required to note the page numbers of any quotations or specific examples in parentheses at the end of the sentence write the conclusion this should be one paragraph that summarizes your arguments so far and brings the reader back to your thesis or main point 6 x research source a great way to think of your conclusion is that it s one last chance to explain to your reader how you see all of your points fitting together proofread proofread proofread make sure and give your paper a thorough once over looking for typos grammatical errors and things that don t quite make sense 7 x trustworthy source purdue online writing lab trusted resource for writing and citation guidelines go to source sometimes it s hard to see our own mistakes so it can really help to exchange papers with a friend and proofread each other s work,Education-and-Communications
how to write a book synopsis,a book synopsis is a brief summary of a book s storyline or content literary agents and publishers often require writers to submit a synopsis to pitch their work the challenge of sitting down to condense an entire book down to a few paragraphs or pages is a daunting one and there is no single way to write a good synopsis nevertheless you can take specific steps to produce an impressive synopsis that will capture readers attention and leave them excited to enjoy the entire book,establish the premise although the synopsis is a very brief snapshot of a much larger work you still need to take the time to establish the overall premise of the novel and include any essential information the reader would need to understand the story 1 x research source imagine someone is reading the synopsis before the book what information is critical to include are there specific details about the setting of the novel or the world you ve created that a reader would need to understand remember you are trying to draw the reader into the story so include a few interesting details that help people visualize where and when this is occurring emphasize the conflict in the novel it can be overwhelming trying to decide what to include in a synopsis but a good rule of thumb is to identify and outline the main conflict in the story 2 x research source what struggles does the protagonist or main character confront in the book are there specific obstacles the characters encounter that you should mention in the synopsis what will happen if the protagonist fails or stumbles show character development while it can be frustrating to try and condense a novel s worth of awesome character development into a synopsis many literary agents report that they want synopses to demonstrate how the main character changes over the course of the novel 3 x research source try to keep the main characters from appearing one dimensional by showing how they react to different situations even though you don t have a lot of space in the synopsis you can still provide readers with a sense of who the characters are and how they change over the course of the story outline the plot because the synopsis is designed to be a summary of the book you will need to outline the plot of your novel and give a sense of the novel s narrative direction 4 x research source it can be hard not to get bogged down in details but a good place to start is by including a brief summary 1 to 2 sentences of each chapter then try to link and connect these summaries together 5 x research source you won t be able to include all plot details so try to identify the ones that are critical to understanding the book ask yourself if the ending would still make sense without that detail if so then leave it out of the synopsis 6 x research source be clear about the book s ending you might be reluctant to spoil the ending but a synopsis should be clear about the novel s ending and ultimate resolution 7 x research source 8 x research source literary agents want to know how you resolve the conflict in the novel and tie up your story don t worry if your story is published the synopsis won t be included on the back of the book and spoil the story for readers review your synopsis it s important for you to review the synopsis and also ask other people to review the synopsis the more feedback you seek from others the clearer you can make your synopsis it can be helpful to read your synopsis out loud because you will be better able to notice grammar mistakes and find opportunities to improve the wording your brain has to process the information in a different way when you read aloud and you often notice mistakes and problems you previously overlooked 9 x trustworthy source university of north carolina writing center unc s on campus and online instructional service that provides assistance to students faculty and others during the writing process go to source ask friends family members or colleagues who have not read the book yet or aren t familiar with what you are working on to read the synopsis they will be able to provide a more objective view and let you know if the synopsis makes sense to them and draws them into the story make sure your synopsis answers the important questions before you submit your synopsis make sure it provides an answer to the following critical questions 10 x research source who is the central character in the book what are they looking for searching for or trying to achieve who or what makes their search quest or journey difficult what ends up happening keep practicing many writers report that synopses are among the most difficult pieces to write because they are trying to distill an entire book s worth of material into a few paragraphs fortunately however the more often you practice writing synopses the better you will be at this exercise 11 x research source to get practice writing synopses try working on one for a classic book or try writing a synopsis of a book you just read sometimes it is easier to start out practicing on a book that you haven t spent hours days or years preparing follow any specific guidelines provided if you are working with an agent or a specific publisher make sure you ask them about or familiarize yourself with their specific guidelines for the synopsis you want to make sure you format it and submit it the way they want so it gets the best reception possible 12 x research source if you are unsure ask the agent or publisher about length formatting and style even if this is an assignment for a class make sure you adhere to the instructions or guidelines your teacher provided include a brief summary of the book just like a synopsis for a work of fiction you need to offer a brief summary of the content 13 x research source focus on clearly articulating your argument and explain why the book should be published make an argument for why your book is important in some way outline the structure of the work even if you have not finished the book you should still be able to provide a clear outline of its structure in the synopsis provide a chapter breakdown with temporary titles for each chapter which will give an agent or publisher a good idea of the direction the work is headed 14 x research source you can also include a short description 1 to 2 sentences of each chapter identify how your book is different from the competition in the synopsis explain what sets your book apart from existing material on the subject discuss how you bring something different to the table 15 x research source 16 x research source for example does your book offer a unique perspective or a new way of thinking about a topic list the leading authors and publications in the field and be clear about how your project is original also describe why you are the author best suited or qualified to produce this work discuss the market for the book a publisher will look at your book and try to determine its place in the market and the intended audience take space in the synopsis to discuss where you see the book fitting in to the existing market 17 x research source include information on the section of the bookstore or bookshop you see your book being stocked in this helps publishers assess whether the book will have an audience and how it should be marketed are there groups you think would have a definite interest in this book for example would this be used in specific college courses or are there events such as historical anniversaries that the book could be linked to and marketed around 18 x research source address your time table many nonfiction books are accepted while still being written but you should provide a clear time table of your anticipated progress in the synopsis 19 x research source discuss how much is currently completed and give an estimate of when you expect to have a manuscript prepared provide additional details include other pertinent details in the synopsis such as an estimated word count and information about whether you will need illustrations the more information you include about the structure and format of the book the easier it will be for a publisher to determine if they would like to take the project on 20 x research source promote your credentials to strengthen your synopsis share the interesting and unique credentials that helped you write the book 21 x research source while education and training are important things to mention also think about whether there are parts of your background or life that publishers and readers may find interesting ask for feedback like any writing activity sharing a draft of your synopsis with others can help you improve your wording and make the synopsis clearer and more compelling ask friends family and colleagues for feedback on a draft you do not have to be a specialist in the field to determine if a synopsis is interesting and readable so don t worry about finding someone who is an expert on the subject matter you write about don t write the synopsis from the perspective of your main character the synopsis should be written from a third person perspective rather than from the point of view of your main characters synopses are also usually written in present rather than past tense 22 x research source for example instead of writing i went to the beach house every summer write susan travels to the beach every summer pare down your wording synopses are meant to be brief and wordiness is a common mistake in synopses although it can feel painful to cut out dialogue and trim down wording it will help you create a more sleek and readable synopsis 23 x research source ask yourself if all the details are really relevant to the synopsis or if they can be left out if your reader can still get a good idea of what the book is about without those details scrap them dialogue is usually unnecessary in the synopsis but if you do include it keep it to a minimum and make sure it is used to reveal an important turning point or character development don t worry about making your prose lyrical or elaborate it will take up too much space and you should focus your energy on using precise wording and providing a clear summary of your book when you re read your synopsis ask yourself if there is a clearer or more precise word you could use in place of the one you currently included avoid revealing too many character details or introducing secondary characters you ve probably spent a lot of time developing your characters and their backstories but the synopsis is not the place to explore all of these details or introduce every character in your book 24 x research source 25 x research source include just enough detail to make the characters interesting and establish how they are connected or related in the synopsis a few phrases are typically sufficient to explain who a character is and where they come from stop analyzing or interpreting the book s themes the synopsis is intended to be a summary or brief overview of the book so do not feel pressured to engage in literary analysis or interpretation of the book s themes or hidden meanings the synopsis is not the place for this kind of examination don t leave unanswered or rhetorical questions in the synopsis although you might feel tempted to build suspense and leave certain questions unanswered or ask rhetorical questions these will distract the reader from your synopsis 26 x research source for example don t write will tyler ever identify his mother s killer instead of posing this question your synopsis should provide an answer avoid writing a synopsis that is simply a basic plot summary you want your synopsis to draw readers in and make them want to read the entire work offering a basic play by play of the story will make the reader feel like they are reviewing a dry technical manual 27 x research source instead try to inject more emotion and detail into the synopsis by giving insight into how the characters feel if you find yourself writing things such as this happened then this happened and finally this occurred it s time to take a break and revisit the synopsis when you are feeling fresh you don t want the synopsis to feel like a boring rundown of a sports game some writers suggest pretending you are describing the book to your friends in the same way you would describe an exciting movie omit the boring or trivial details and focus on the highlights 28 x research source double space the synopsis if the synopsis is longer than one page in length double space the document it will be easier for the literary agent to read be sure to include your book s title and your name when you are rushing to finish your synopsis it can be easy to forget including the title of your book and your name make sure these details are on each page of the document in the upper left hand corner if a literary agent likes your synopsis you want to make sure they know who to contact use a standard font while you might feel like you should use a more interesting font it s best to stick with a standard one such as times new roman that is easy to read and will open on a variety of devices if you typed your book in a certain font stick with the same font for the synopsis so they match you might also be submitting sample chapters and the documents will look like they are part of the same package or go together indent paragraphs although the synopsis is a shorter document you do not want it to appear like you wrote it in a stream of consciousness to prevent this from happening indent paragraphs so your synopsis looks neat and well organized pay attention to length guidelines length requirements of synopses vary depending on the literary agent or publishing company make sure you follow the guidelines you are given or ask the agent or publisher you are working with what they would prefer some writers recommend starting with a 5 page synopsis and then condensing this document and trimming it down as needed be prepared for different length requirements ahead of time by having a 1 page and 3 page synopsis on hand even if the length requirements are slightly different you should be able to easily adapt a 1 page or 3 page version 29 x research source,Education-and-Communications

give you concrete examples of how the review should be formatted and what information should be covered if you plan to write a review for your own blog reading other reviews will give you ideas on developing a consistent format for the reviews you post learn about the writer and artist who worked on the graphic novel this will tell you something of the past works of the writer and artist which can direct you to other works you may want to read for comparison and contrast it will also provide you with biographical information about the writer or artist so that you can see the artistic and life influences in his or her work prominent writers and artists such as frank miller have their own websites while information about other comics writers and artists may be available on fan created websites and blogs or on sites such as wikipedia imdb or youtube when reading from any fan created website or post be sure to view the material with a critical eye the quality of the writing is an indication but also look for an about page that tells you about the person or group putting the material together look the graphic novel over before you actually read it consider some of the things that attract you to the graphic novel you re holding in your hands the title both the actual words and the way they re rendered the subject matter the cover art front and back any blurbs the author and artist and so on any of these can serve as a jumping off point for your review skim through the graphic novel to get a sense of the writing and art styles note how the graphic novel is structured superhero graphic novels may either be original stories or collected from story arcs published over a series of issues of a regular title or miniseries such as frank miller s batman the dark knight returns being compiled from a 4 issue miniseries each issue becomes a chapter title in the book graphic novels about real people such as reinhard kleist s i see a darkness about the life of johnny cash is structured around key points of cash s life and career his early years his 1968 concert at folsom prison at the height of his career and concluding his final album for rick rubin just after wife june carter s death read through the graphic novel carefully taking notes as you go make notes about the story the writing the art and any literary or artistic devices you see used in telling the story for example both the dark knight returns and i see a darkness make considerable use of shadow in their art for the dark knight returns which is rendered in color the shadows show both the gritty reality of the graphic novels version of gotham city the story is set in and symbolize the twilight of bruce wayne s batman career in i see a darkness the shadows tie into johnny cash s nickname of the man in black and symbolize the inner demons that plagued him in the early years of his career include the information the reader needs to identify and find the graphic novel you need to provide the graphic novel s title author and artist and genre you should also include the publisher and copyright release date the format hardcover or softcover and if writing the review to encourage others to buy the graphic novel its price and isbn number if the graphic novel is a compilation of a story arc presented across several issues of a comic book you should list the original comics that carried the story include the dates of publication if there is the possibility of confusion due to issue renumbering such as dc comics 2011 reboot of all its titles all of which were reset to issue 1 if the characters in the graphic novel are not well known but appear in other media such as a webcomic you should mention the other media they appear in including web links as appropriate identify the author artist s reason for producing the graphic novel this step is most appropriate for original graphic novels or those compiled from limited comic book series instead of from a story arc in a regular comic book the purpose may be covered or alluded to in a written preface or may also be discussed in an interview of the author artist but in many cases you can deduce it by careful reading of the graphic novel itself explain what the graphic novel is about you do this on 2 levels describing the plot of the story and by covering themes expressed in the work the plot is the basic story identify the major characters describe the setting and mention the story s major events but don t give away the ending or any surprises the theme is a specific portion of the subject of the work for example in alan moore s watchmen one theme would be how superheroes would affect the real world and be affected by it if they lived in it a work may encompass several themes or deal with several variations of a theme for example in watchmen the theme of superheroes as being on the fringe of humanity is represented by rorschach s partial insanity and dr manhattan s increasingly detached behavior as a result of perceiving all of time at once describe the quality of the writing discuss the pacing of the story the amount of time spent in building up the main conflict the conflict itself and its resolution without stating how the conflict is resolved note the dialog and whether it makes sense for the character speaking it and for a juvenile graphic novel how appropriate it is for the reader cover any literary techniques used in the work such as the use of allegory metaphor and symbolism note that in a graphic novel the artwork supplements and sometimes replaces the use of words to convey images to the reader s mind describe the artwork and how it supports or doesn t support the story describe the general artistic style realistic cartoon like manga and how it is used in the story earth tones for a nature goddess dead gnarled trees in a graveyard red strips on the walls of government offices to represent red tape etc also note any unusual placements of panels such as alan moore s choice to use a 3 x 3 panel grid for watchmen instead of the usual 2 x 4 grid and how they impact the pacing of the story give your opinion of the work in addition to providing a description of the graphic novel s high points and low points you need to identify what for you were the high and low points with concrete examples to back up your assertions depending on the audience you re writing for you can express your opinions in first person i liked gates of gotham because or in third person the nightrunner character would have been better served by including the story of how he came to join up with batman

absorbent place your book at the bottom of the smaller container place it inside the larger container that is filled with cat litter 3 x research source leave the book to sit in the absorbent for a few days check every few days if the odor has gone remove the book or books and dust off a new paint brush is ideal for dusting if not repeat until the book smells better store in a clean dry place to avoid reintroducing mildew try baking soda place a cup of baking soda into a plastic box or bin place the book or books this method is good for more than one book inside and seal the lid well let it sit for 48 72 hours and then check repeat this process until the odor is gone another approach if you live where it s dry and sunny sprinkle baking soda between every 10 pages or so leave the book open outside during the daytime for a few days in a row turning pages often continue until it smells better this won t work for all mildew or musty odors but it can be helpful for some this is not advised for valuable or antique books place newspaper between the pages place a sheet of newspaper between every few pages of the book leave the newspaper in the book for three to five days do not use this method on valuable or old books since newspaper is acidic and may transfer ink to the book use fabric softener sheets these sheets absorb odors from fabric and they can do so for books too again the oils in dryer sheets can damage books so be mindful when using this method cut a bunch of sheets into thirds and put one between every 20 pages or so in the smelly book keep the book in a zipper bag a few days then the musty smell should be gone try the following this method is good for preventing the musty smell of books as well just put a piece of a fabric softener sheet in every fifth book or so on your bookshelf cut a small square of fresh fragrant drawer liner place it inside a book use 2 3 pieces depending on the size of the book then place the book inside a resealable plastic bag let it sit in a dry spot for a week or two check to see if the fresh odor has been transferred to the book continue until the book smells better use strong essential oils add drops of an essential oil like lavender eucalyptus or tea tree oil to cotton balls to a sealable plastic bag add the book to the plastic bag and seal remove your book after a few days due to the risk of oil spots only do this with less valuable books that you want to read such as textbooks check storage areas beforehand the storage area should be dry and temperate as cold can encourage dampness and heat can dry out paper causing it to crumble excessive humidity is bad for books so either find storage with low humidity or reduce the humidity 4 x research source check the attic or basement for leaks mildew and dampness check your storage facility for bad odors or signs of mildew before storing your book there use appropriate storage containers choose plastic boxes if the storage area is prone to leaks or dampness also add silica gel sachets in case of condensation plan your shelving carefully don t overfill your bookshelves ensure that there is adequate air circulation between books check to make sure that bookcases are not standing against cold moldy or damp walls add dust jackets to books these clear jackets will keep moisture away from your beloved book it s easier and cheaper to replace dust jackets

tail or bottom of the book 6 x research source use extreme caution with any tears or damaged edges use the soft brush to very gently address these spots brush the spine and outer boards of the book wipe the spine with your cloth or brush moving in one direction only in order to protect the boards mentally divide the front and back cover into halves and wipe from that center rather than from one end to the other 7 x research source if the spine has raised horizontal bands wipe across rather than up and over the bumps be careful of any damaged edges leather corners or decoration avoid snagging the brush or cloth on these elements use your vacuum for heavy dust or mold on the outside of the book ensure that your attachment is an extremely soft brush and place your vacuum on the lowest possible setting gently and carefully vacuum up the dirt moving in only one direction start with the head move to the fore edge then the tail and finally finish with the spine and outer boards for damaged books place some cheesecloth or a nylon stocking over the end of the vacuum vacuum up the dirt on the medium setting without touching the book by hovering just above the surface of the book clean the dust jacket many books now come with dust jackets these paper coverings are generally glossy or matte in finish while they re attractive they often get dusty and may also tear use your soft

how to break in a bible,breaking in a new bible can improve the book s longevity by several years additional first time and long term care practices can help strengthen the physical condition of the bible even more,place the spine on a hard surface hold the closed bible with one hand rest the spine on a table or counter throughout the entire process you ll need to use one hand to hold the upright closed portion of the bible in place you ll need to use your other hand to open and crease each section let the covers fall open keep the pages closed while carefully releasing the front and back covers gently ease the covers open until they lie flat on the table instead of letting the covers drop quickly it would be better to slowly open and lay them down using your free hand crease open a section of pages at the front carefully open the first 50 to 100 pages of the bible lay them out flat then slowly run your fingers up and down the gutter of the top page pressing into the binding as you move this action gently stretches the stitching of the bible binding making the pages of the book more flexible easier to turn and easier to handle as a result the pages of the book are less likely to loosen or fall out when being handled crease open a section at the back open the back 50 to 100 pages of the bible and let them lay flat on table gently yet firmly run your fingers up and down the gutter here as well this back section should be just as thick as the front section was by alternating between the front and back of the book you can make sure that the stitches are stretched evenly in both directions repeat through the remaining pages continue opening and creasing sections of the bible using the same technique alternate back and forth between front sections and back sections repeating as often as necessary until the bible is completely and evenly split open 1 x research source once the entire book lies open on the table the breaking in process is complete let it rest if you ordered your bible and had it shipped to you in cold weather open the package and let the book sit out at room temperature overnight before handling it further cold temperatures can cause the binding to become stiff and brittle so it lacks the same sort of flexibility it might otherwise have opening and handling the book while it is in this state can weaken the stitches or glue holding it together if you purchased your bible from a store or received it in the mail on a temperate to warm day this step is not necessary apply oil to real leather covers gently buff the cover of authentic leather bibles with mink oil or neatsfoot oil allow the oil to soak into the cover overnight soak a small patch of a clean rag in the oil then gently buff the oil over the entire cover using small circular motions coat the cover thoroughly and evenly using as little oil as necessary to get the job done any excess oil should be removed with a clean cloth the cover will feel sticky at first but after the oil soaks in that stickiness should fade away treat the end of the ribbon bookmark if the bible has a ribbon bookmark treat the end of the ribbon to prevent it from fraying you can use either liquid seam sealant or a low flame to accomplish this task seam sealant is the safest and easiest option choose a seam sealant like fray check or fray block apply a small dab of the sealant onto the end of the ribbon smoothing it over the raw edge in a thin even layer let the sealant dry if the bookmark is an acetate ribbon and not a silk one you can use a match or small lighter to prevent the raw edge from fraying hold the raw edge of the ribbon in a low flame for approximately 5 seconds working carefully to prevent the ribbon from catching on fire remove the ribbon from the flame and pinch the end with your fingers to cool it down and set the end flip through the pages if the bible has gilded edges quickly flip through the pages passing your thumb over each edge in the process doing so can help break apart pages that are stuck together 2 x research source most modern bibles are decorated with art gilt pages the edges are dyed red and gold foil is melted over the red dye creating an orange gold hue that lasts longer than painted gold gilt since the gold foil was melted onto the page edges though the pages have a tendency to stick together initially quickly fanning the pages with your thumb should separate most of the pages but if you do run across stuck pages as you handle your bible later you should usually be able to carefully pull them apart by rubbing the two pages in between your thumb and index finger keep the bible out of direct sunlight try not to let the book sit out in direct sunlight or areas of strong heat for prolonged periods of time sunlight can cause the colors of the cover and the page gilding to fade heat can cause leather and faux leather to dry out and become stiff avoid moisture keep the bible as dry as possible especially if the cover is made from authentic leather store it in an area of low humidity excessive moisture can cause leather and faux leather covers to dry out humidity or dampness can also cause mold to develop contact with water will cause the pages to ripple and warp support upright bibles if you plan to stand your bible on a bookshelf make sure that both sides are supported by other books or bookends if you store the book so that it lies flat on its back cover no extra support should be needed mark carefully if you plan to highlight sections of the bible or make notes during your studies use a pencil ballpoint pen or specially designed bible marking highlighter or pen 3 x research source do not use pens markers or highlighters with felt tips gel inks or roller points the ink produced by these writing instruments will usually bleed through the pages causing them to stick together and making your notes difficult to read use the bible regularly the best way to keep the cover in good shape is to handle it on a regular basis the natural oils produced by your hand should keep the leather or faux leather in good condition oil allows leather and faux leather to remain supple and easy to handle your skin produces natural oils though and they alone should be enough to keep the cover in good shape if you handle it on a fairly consistent basis if you do not handle this particular bible for several months or years though you may need to apply supplementary oil apply additional oil if necessary you can keep authentic leather covers in even better condition by applying minx oil or neatsfoot oil once every year or two this is especially beneficial if you don t handle your bible regularly apply a small amount of your chosen oil using a clean rag buff the oil over the entire cover using small gentle circular movements wipe away excess oil with a clean rag and let the book dry overnight quickly clean away dirt and spills if you accidentally get the cover dirty you can clean the dirt or spill away with a lukewarm water and mild liquid detergent dip a clean soft rag in lukewarm water ring out the excess water then apply a dab of mild detergent to the wet rag rub the detergent into the rag until a mild lather forms wipe the dirt or spill away with this soapy rag wipe away any soap residue with a separate damp rag free of soap thoroughly dry the cover with a clean soft dry towel do not allow the cover to air dry,Education-and-Communications
how to remove the mildew smell from books,old books are wonderful treasures to come across and can even be worth money however many old books carry a distinct musty smell between drying the pages and using an absorbent to remove odors you can remove the mildew smell from your beloved books,fan out the pages of your book stand the book upright on a table fan out the pages gently if your fingers can t disentangle pages without ripping them use a letter opener and tweezers to separate pages alternatively blow toward the top of your book to fan the pages out use a hairdryer to dry pages if you would like to speed up the process you can aim a hairdryer at the pages of your book keep it on a warm setting to avoid books becoming affected by heat damage continue aiming the hairdryer at your upright book until the pages are dry let books stand to dry in a spot free of moisture either choose a warm spot inside your home or place the book in the sun only place the book in direct sunlight if your book isn t valuable direct sunlight may fade the book and especially for older books this could lead to permanent disintegration discoloration and the curling up of the pages ensure that every page is dry before returning the book to its shelf use silica packets to remove moisture you can purchase silica gel packets from an arts and crafts store these keep things dry by attracting any moisture 1 x research source place these within the pages of your book and leave them for about three days if you are worried about creating indents in the pages only leave them in the book for one day 2 x research source try kitty litter you will need a large container such as a rubbermaid tub and a smaller container fill the larger container halfway with kitty litter which will act as an absorbent place your book at the bottom of the smaller container place it inside the larger container that is filled with cat litter 3 x research source leave the book to sit in the absorbent for a few days check every few days if the odor has gone remove the book or books and dust off a new paint brush is ideal for dusting if not repeat until the book smells better store in a clean dry place to avoid reintroducing mildew try baking soda place a cup of baking soda into a plastic box or bin place the book or books this method is good for more than one book inside and seal the lid well let it sit for 48 72 hours and then check repeat this process until the odor is gone another approach if you live where it s dry and sunny sprinkle baking soda between every 10 pages or so leave the book open outside during the daytime for a few days in a row turning pages often continue until it smells better this won t work for all mildew or musty odors but it can be helpful for some this is not advised for valuable or antique books place newspaper between the pages place a sheet of newspaper between every few pages of the book leave the newspaper in the book for three to five days do not use this method on valuable or old books since newspaper is acidic and may transfer ink to the book use fabric softener sheets these sheets absorb odors from fabric and they can do so for books too again the oils in dryer sheets can damage books so be mindful when using this method cut a bunch of sheets into thirds and put one between every 20 pages or so in the smelly book keep the book in a zipper bag a few days then the musty smell should be gone try the following this method is good for preventing the musty smell of books as well just put a piece of a fabric softener sheet in every fifth book or so on your bookshelf cut a small square of fresh fragrant drawer liner place it inside a book use 2 3 pieces depending on the size of the book then place the book inside a resealable plastic bag let it sit in a dry spot for a week or two check to see if the fresh odor has been transferred to the book continue until the book smells better use strong essential oils add drops of an essential oil like lavender eucalyptus or tea tree oil to cotton balls to a sealable plastic bag add the book to the plastic bag and seal remove your book after a few days due to the risk of oil spots only do this with less valuable books that you want to read such as textbooks check storage areas beforehand the storage area should be dry and temperate as cold can encourage dampness and heat can dry out paper causing it to crumble excessive humidity is bad for books so either find storage with low humidity or reduce the humidity 4 x research source check the attic or basement for leaks mildew and dampness check your storage facility for bad odors or signs of mildew before storing your book there use appropriate storage containers choose plastic boxes if the storage area is prone to leaks or dampness also add silica gel sachets in case of condensation plan your shelving carefully don t overfill your bookshelves ensure that there is adequate air circulation between books check to make sure that
