how to determine gear ratio,in mechanical engineering a gear ratio is a direct measure of the ratio of the rotational speeds of two or more interlocking gears as a general rule when dealing with two gears if the drive gear the one directly receiving rotational force from the engine motor etc is bigger than the driven gear the latter will turn more quickly and vice versa we can express this basic concept with the formula gear ratio t2 t1 where t1 is the number of teeth on the first gear and t2 is the number of teeth on the second 1 x research source,start with a two gear train to be able to determine a gear ratio you must have at least two gears engaged with each other this is called a gear train usually the first gear is a drive gear attached to the motor shaft and the second is a driven gear attached to the load shaft there may also be any number of gears between these two to transmit power from the drive gear to the driven gear these are called idler gears 2 x research source for now let s look at a gear train with only two gears in it to be able to find a gear ratio these gears have to be interacting with each other in other words their teeth need to be meshed and one should be turning the other for example purposes let s say that you have one small drive gear gear 1 turning a larger driven gear gear 2 count the number of teeth on the drive gear one simple way to find the gear ratio between two interlocking gears is to compare the number of teeth the little peg like protrusions at the edge of the wheel that they both have start by determining how many teeth are on the drive gear you can do this by counting manually or sometimes by checking for this information labeled on the gear itself 3 x research source for example purposes let s say that the smaller drive gear in our system has 20 teeth count the number of teeth on the driven gear next determine how many teeth are on the driven gear exactly as you did before for the drive gear let s say that in our example the driven gear has 30 teeth divide one teeth count by the other now that you know how many teeth are on each gear you can find the gear ratio relatively simply divide the driven gear teeth by the drive gear teeth depending on your assignment you may write your answer as a decimal a fraction or in ratio form i e x y 4 x research source in our example dividing the 30 teeth of the driven gear by the 20 teeth of the drive gear gets us 30 20 1 5 we can also write this as 3 2 or 1 5 1 etc what this gear ratio means is that the smaller driver gear must turn one and a half times to get the larger driven gear to make one complete turn this makes sense since the driven gear is bigger it will turn more slowly 5 x research source start with a gear train of more than two gears as its name suggests a gear train can also be made from a long sequence of gears not just a single driver gear and a single driven gear in these cases the first gear remains the driver gear the last gear remains the driven gear and the ones in the middle become idler gears these are often used to change the direction of rotation or to connect two gears when direct gearing would make them unwieldy or not readily available 6 x research source let s say for example purposes that the two gear train described above is now driven by a small seven toothed gear in this case the 30 toothed gear remains the driven gear and the 20 toothed gear which was the driver before is now an idler gear divide the teeth numbers of the drive and driven gears the important thing to remember when dealing with gear trains with more than two gears is that only the driver and driven gears usually the first and last ones matter in other words the idler gears don t affect the gear ratio of the overall train at all when you ve identified your driver gear and your driven gear you can find the gear ratio exactly as before in our example we would find the gear ratio by dividing the thirty teeth of the driven gear by the seven teeth of our new driver 30 7 about 4 3 or 4 3 1 etc this means that the driver gear has to turn about 4 3 times to get the much larger driven gear to turn once if desired find the gear ratios for the intermediate gears you can find the gear ratios involving the idler gears as well and you may want to in certain situations in these cases start from the drive gear and work toward the load gear treat the preceding gear as if it were the drive gear as far as the next gear is concerned divide the number of teeth on each driven gear by the number of teeth on the drive gear for each interlocking set of gears to calculate the intermediate gear ratios in our example the intermediate gear ratios are 20 7 2 9 and 30 20 1 5 note that neither of these are equal to the gear ratio for the entire train 4 3 however note also that 20 7 30 20 4 3 in general the intermediate gear ratios of a gear train will multiply together to equal the overall gear ratio find the rotational speed of your drive gear using the idea of gear ratios it s easy to figure out how quickly a driven gear is rotating based on the input speed of the drive gear to start find the rotational speed of your drive gear in most gear calculations this is given in rotations per minute rpm though other units of velocity will also work 7 x research source for example let s say that in the example gear train above with a seven toothed driver gear and a 30 toothed driven gear the drive gear is rotating at 130 rpms with this information we ll find the speed of the driven gear in the next few steps plug your information into the formula s1 t1 s2 t2 in this formula s1 refers to the rotational speed of the drive gear t1 refers to the teeth in the drive gear and s2 and t2 to the speed and teeth of the driven gear fill in the variables until you have only one left undefined often in these sorts of problems you ll be solving for s2 though it s perfectly possible to solve for any of the variables in our example plugging in the information we have we get this 130 rpms 7 s2 30 solve finding your remaining variable is a matter of basic algebra just simplify the rest of the equation and isolate the variable on one side of the equals sign and you will have your answer don t forget to label it with the correct units you can lose points for this in schoolwork in our example we can solve like this 130 rpms 7 s2 30 910 s2 30 910 30 s2 30 33 rpms s2 in other words if the drive gear spins at 130 rpms the driven gear will spin at 30 33 rpms this makes sense since the driven gear is much bigger it will spin much slower,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to adjust an air fuel mixture screw,an air fuel mixture screw is a special screw on an engine s carburetor that controls how much air mixes with the fuel adjusting this screw changes how fast or slow an engine idles and how smoothly it runs the basic process for adjusting an air fuel mixture screw is the same for all small engines whether it s on a car motorcycle or other type of engine make adjustments with the engine warmed up and running set the screw in the position where the engine idles most smoothly and doesn t sound rough or irregular to balance the fuel mixture so that the engine has an ideal air fuel ratio,start the engine and let it run for 5 minutes to warm it up turn the key in the ignition to start the engine warm up the engine to normal operating temperature by letting it idle for about 5 minutes keep the engine running after it warms up 1 x research source always make air fuel mixture screw adjustments with a warm engine and the engine running so you can listen to how the adjustments affect the engine s idle speed note that this process is the same for any type of engine with an air fuel mixture screw it could be a car motorcycle scooter atv or anything else with a carburetor locate the carburetor by finding the engine s air filter look at the engine and spot the round or cone shaped air filter the carburetor is the part of the engine that the air filter is attached to 3 x research source the air filter on a car might be large and round it usually sits on top of the carburetor on a motorcycle the air filter usually comes off the side of the engine and faces the rear of the bike find the flat headed slotted gold colored brass screw on the carburetor look at all the different screws on the carburetor until you spot the gold one with a flat slotted head this is the air fuel mixture screw 4 x research source most air fuel mixture screws are located on the side of the carburetor but it depends on the specific engine turn the screw clockwise until the engine starts to sound rough use a flathead screwdriver to tighten the screw listen to the engine s idle sound and stop turning the screw when it starts making a rough rising and falling sound instead of its normal idling sound 5 x research source tightening the screw weakens the air and fuel mixture and decreases the amount of fuel flowing to the engine tightening the screw is also called making the fuel mixture leaner which lowers the rpms at which the engine idles running a lean fuel mixture makes the engine run with less fuel than it needs to run efficiently this can damage an engine because there is more friction between moving parts and the engine operates at a higher temperature loosen the screw and count the turns until the engine sounds irregular use your flathead screwdriver to turn the screw counterclockwise counting the number of rotations you make as you go listen to the idling of the engine and stop turning the screw when the engine s idle sound starts sounding irregular like it is revving too fast 6 x research source loosening the screw strengthens the air and fuel mixture and increases the amount of fuel flowing to the engine loosening the screw is also called making the fuel mixture richer which increases the rpms at which the engine idles running a rich fuel mixture causes the engine to run with more fuel than it needs to operate efficiently this means that it will burn fuel much faster than necessary although the engine may run with more power and at a cooler temperature set the screw in the middle between the rough and irregular sounding spots turn the screw back clockwise until it is approximately in the middle location between where the engine s idle sounds irregular and rough this will set the engine at a regular idle speed 7 x research source for example if you turned the screw 2 full turns counterclockwise from the spot where the engine s idle started to sound rough now turn the screw clockwise 1 full turn make adjustments 1 2 a turn in either direction to find the smoothest idle speed turn the screw counterclockwise and clockwise 1 2 a turn from the middle position and listen to the sound of the idle set the screw in the position where the engine s idle sounds most even and smooth to balance the fuel mixture 8 x research source you might notice that turning the screw 1 2 a turn in either direction makes the engine start to sound rougher or more irregular in which case you can just set the screw back to the middle position this adjustment process is also known as balancing the idle mixture most engines have an ideal air fuel ratio or afr around 14 7 1 you could find your engine s exact afr using a special meter but this isn t really necessary unless you want to be ultra precise such as if you re tuning a high performance race car or motorcycle 10 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to test a vehicle speed sensor with a multimeter,a vehicle speed sensor or vss is a sensor that is used to determine how fast your vehicle is traveling if your vehicle s speedometer stops working or isn t telling you the correct speed that you re traveling you likely have a faulty vss you can test your vss to make sure it s functioning properly by using a device called a multimeter start by disconnecting and removing the vss from your engine so you can test it you can then connect it to a multimeter and set the multimeter to the ac setting connect the vss to a power drill so you can simulate the rotation of the vehicle s transmission and read the multimeter to see if the voltage increases as the speed increases to check if the sensor is working properly,make sure the vehicle is turned off to avoid being shocked put the vehicle in park on level ground and turn off any lights or accessories that may draw power from the battery remove the key from the engine to make sure it s completely turned off 1 x research source parking on level ground makes it easier for you to access the vss open the hood of the vehicle so you can access the engine locate and pull the release hatch near the driver s side door to open the hood engage the interior release hatch on the front of your hood and raise the hood up if your hood uses a rod to hold it open move the rod to its slot 2 x research source make sure the hood is held securely in place before you lean into it to test the vss locate the vss sensor near the transmission of your vehicle find the transmission dipstick and follow it to locate your transmission the vss will be a small sensor attached to your transmission by 2 wires and held in place by a bracket it will also have a sliding pull tab on it look for a small metal sensor surrounded by a metal bracket with a white and black wire connected to it 3 x research source vehicle speed sensors can be installed in different locations depending on what make and model of vehicle you have but they measure the rotation of the transmission so they ll generally be located on or next to the transmission consult your owner s manual to find the location of your vss disengage the wiring harness connector from the vss there are 2 wires connected to the vss a black one and a white one both wires connect the vss to your vehicle to ground the sensor and transmit information about you re vehicle s speed unplug the harness so you can take out the sensor 4 x research source the wiring harness may be located on the underside of the vss if you can t grip the harness with your fingers use a pair of needle nose pliers to disengage it press the pull tab or button on the vss to separate it on the top or side of your vss will be a sliding tab or a button engage the tab or button and gently pull on the sensor to release it from its housing 5 x research source you may need to wiggle or slide the vss out of its base don t force or yank the vss or you could damage it make sure you ve engaged the sliding tab or the button that releases it some sensors may require you to remove 2 small screws to slide it out of place unscrew the hold down bolt and bracket to remove the vss use a screwdriver to remove the bracket around the vss then use a socket wrench with a piece that fits over the bolt to twist the bolt and loosen it so you can pull out the sensor 6 x research source make sure you don t lose the screws or bolts so you can replace the sensor plug the colored lead cables into their slots on the multimeter your multimeter will have a red and a black lead cable plug the black lead into the black colored terminal that s labeled com which stands for common then insert the red lead into the red colored terminal labeled v for voltage which is what you re testing 7 x research source push the leads into their slots completely they may click into place when they re fully connected set the multimeter to ac to test your vss look for a dial on your multimeter that has numbers and letters on it the ac or alternating current setting may be labeled as ac v with a squiggly line or acv turn the dial until the arrow or indicating line is pointing to the ac setting 8 x trustworthy source science buddies expert sourced database of science projects explanations and educational material go to source electrical devices such as your vss use an ac current for power plug a signal output and ground wire into the sensor on the vss is a slot where the sensor plugs into the vehicle you can find a plug that fits into your vss and contains a white signal output wire and black ground wire from auto supply stores make sure the plug fits your vss securely 9 x research source the plug uses a white signal output wire and a black ground wire to transmit signals from the device to your vehicle you can also find plugs that contain the signal wire and ground online connect the black lead and the red lead to wires on the plug take your black lead wire and clip it to the exposed wire at the end of the black ground wire plugged into the vss then take your red lead wire and connect it to the exposed end of the white signal wire plugged into the sensor 10 x research source make sure the red and black leads are securely connected find a drill bit that fits securely into the vss in order to simulate the movement of your vehicle to properly test the sensor you need to rotate the gear inside of the vss insert drill bits into the gear slot on the vss until you find one that fits securely into it 11 x research source different sensors have differently sized slots so try out a few bits until you find one that fits your vss connect the bit to your power drill loosen the chuck or the piece on the end of the drill by rotating it so the jaws open up slide the smooth end of the bit into the jaws and then slowly rotate the drill to tighten the jaws around the bit so it s held securely 12 x research source give the bit a gentle tug to make sure it won t fall out spin the gears of the vss by pulling the trigger on the drill hold the vss in place with your hand and bring the drill up to speed slowly to rotate the gears in the slot the drill bit is inserted into allow the vss to rotate at full speed so you can get an accurate reading 13 x research source start slowly and continue to increase the speed of the drill at a consistent pace so you don t strip or damage the vss read the voltage on the multimeter to see if it increases with speed while the vss rotates the multimeter will display a voltage reading if the vss is functioning correctly the voltage on the multimeter will increase as the speed of the vss rotation increases 14 x research source if the voltage doesn t increase or doesn t display at all then the vss is damaged or faulty disconnect the plug and drill and reinstall the vss into your vehicle remove the drill bit from the vss and take out the plug containing the white signal output and black ground wires if the vss is functioning properly slide it back into its housing reconnect the wiring harness and replace the bracket and bolts 15 x research source if your vss isn t functioning properly

how to break a chain,whether you own a bike or simply work with chains a lot there will probably come a time at some point where you ll need to break a chain in order to remove and repair it if you re trying to break a bike chain you may need to use pliers if there s a master link on the chain or simply use a chain tool that will break one of the rivets luckily whether you re using a chain tool pliers or bolt cutters there are some simple and easy methods you can follow for breaking a chain,make sure the chain is taut you ll want to avoid having any slack in your chain as you re trying to break it if you re working on a bike chain shift the chain to the largest front and rear sprockets then shift it to the smallest cogs to make the chain wrap around the derailleur pulleys and make it as taut as possible 1 x research source if the chain is wrapped around the derailleur pulley make sure the pulley does not pull so far back that the chain makes contact with itself locate the special connecting rivet and avoid breaking the chain there connecting rivets will look different from other rivets in the chain they may have special flaring or color that other rivets don t when preparing to break the chain with a chain tool make sure you break a rivet that is several rivets away from any connecting rivets in the chain 2 x research source if you re having trouble identifying connecting rivets in your chain search the brand name of your chain along with the words connecting rivets if your chain has connecting rivets the manufacturer will probably have a picture of them available on their website place the chain tool on the rivet where you plan to break the chain line the driving pin of the chain tool up with the rivet in a straight line and make sure the two are in contact if your chain tool has a receptacle for the pin once it s removed make sure the rivet is lined up with this receptacle as well 3 x research source you may need to unscrew part of the chain tool to retract the driving pin before you can place the tool on the rivet make sure the driving pin is in the center of the rivet head otherwise you won t be able to force it out force the rivet out to break the chain once you ve lined up the driving pin with the rivet head turn the handle with force and slowly drive the rivet out of the front plate and partially through the rear plate before completely removing the rivet withdraw the pin and break the chain with your thumbs leaving the rivet slightly protruding from the rear plate 4 x research source this method will allow you to easily locate the hole if you decide to reconnect the link if you don t plan on reinstalling or repairing the chain feel free to push the rivet all the way out with the chain tool shift the bike chains so that they re taut to avoid having any slack in the chain shift it to the largest front and rear sprockets and then shift it to the smallest cogs so that it wraps around the derailleur pulleys this will make the chain as taut as possible 5 x research source if the chain is wrapped around the derailleur pulley make sure the pulley does not pull so far back that the chain makes contact with itself locate the master link on the chain on a linked chain the master link will have a pair of unique side plates that may be a different color than the other links this is the link you ll disengage to break the chain when using pliers 6 x research source the master link will also probably have an embossed arrow on it pointing towards the inside of the chain loop use the pliers to disengage the master link position the pliers over the master link such that one head is placed on the outward side of the master link pin and will be squeezed in the direction of the arrow on the side plate the other head should be placed on the outward side of the opposite pin then squeeze the pliers to push the pins together and press both side plates inward until the link is broken if you have special pliers designed specifically for use on master links they will automatically press the side plates inward for you 7 x research source adjust the cutters to match the strength of the chain most bolt cutters come with an adjustment bolt that allows you to adjust the tension on the blades use this bolt to set the correct tension for the hardness of the chain you re breaking as well as your own operational comfort 8 x research source for small chains like bike chains you most likely will not need to adjust your bolt cutters the weakest setting will probably suffice mark where you want to make the break on the chain to ensure you make a clean cut in the right location use a marking line or even a small dot to to mark where you want the cut to be made use a marker paint or sharp blade to make the mark 9 x research source you should also clamp the chain before cutting it if possible to make the chain easier to break however this is not strictly necessary for breaking a chain with bolt cutters open the blades and position the cutters over the mark pull the handles of the bolt cutters apart to open the blades making sure to open them as far apart as possible before proceeding then move the cutter head so that the marked part of the chain is situated between the blades 10 x research source close the blades and apply force move the handles back towards one another to close the blades over the chain going slowly at first once the blades have made physical contact with the chain continue closing the blades and apply force until the chain has been broken 11 x research source make sure you re using a firm grip when closing the blades if your grip is too loose the blades may slip away from the material and cause harm to you or others around you some chains may require you to break off from your initial cut reposition the blades over the cut and apply force a second time before they finally break,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to clean an abs sensor,your vehicle s anti lock braking system abs keeps the tires from locking up when you brake helping you stay safe on the road if you notice the abs light lit up on your dashboard that means something is interfering with the sensor while it may need to be replaced it s also possible it just needs to be cleaned off which is something you can easily do yourself at home you ll need some basic tools like a car jack and a wrench and about 30 60 minutes to access and clean the sensors if the abs light still comes on after the sensors are cleaned there may be a more technical problem that a mechanic can fix,lift your vehicle using a car jack so you can safely remove the wheels park your car on a hard flat surface and turn off the engine position the car jack at the jack point and carefully engage the jack lift the car off the ground until there is about 1 to 2 inches 2 5 to 5 1 cm of clearance under the wheel 1 x research source if you don t know where your vehicle s jack points are check the owner s manual generally there is a flat metal area behind each front wheel and in front of each back wheel loosen the lug nuts from the tire and remove the wheel from the vehicle use a wrench to remove the lug nuts then set them in a small bowl off to the side so they don t get lost pull the wheel off of the tire hub and move it out of the way so you have room to work 2 x research source if the wheel seems stuck to the hub use a rubber mallet to tap it loose locate the abs sensor along the body of the wheel hub find the reference ring which is the bolt or covering that holds the sensor in place it s usually located along the wheel hub you can start by locating the electrical wire that leads from the wheel and connects the sensor to the vehicle to help yourself find it a bit more easily 3 x research source it can be a little tricky to access the sensor sometimes just depending on how the wheel is turned it s usually located around the backside of the hub if you can t find the sensor your vehicle may have disguised sensors rather than open sensors disguised sensors are usually located internally in the wheel hub and usually don t need to be cleaned because they re protected from dirt if you are having a problem with a disguised abs sensor you ll need to take it to a mechanic remove the bolt covering the abs sensor with an allen wrench loosen the bolt and keep turning the wrench until it comes off completely place the bolt into the bowl with the lug nuts 4 x research source if the bolt is really rusty or not turning easily spray it with wd 40 wait a few minutes and then try again to remove it wiggle the abs sensor loose with a pair of pliers don t pry the sensor up from the bottom as that could cause irreparable damage instead grasp the sensor with the pliers and gently move it back and forth until it pops out 5 x research source if the sensor isn t coming away from the tire hub try repositioning your pliers on alternate sides or wiggling the sensor in a circular motion to dislodge any rust or dirt that is holding it in place the sensor is connected to the car by a wire there isn t any reason to detach the wire so just leave it in place blow canned air into the area where the sensor was lodged this removes any dirt or bits of metal that may have fallen in either turn your face away or put on a pair of safety goggles so nothing accidentally gets into your eyes 6 x research source don t try to wash the area out water will cause more issues wipe dirt and debris off the sensor with a clean dry microfiber towel chances are that there was some kind of interference between the sensor and the wheel causing your abs light to come on it s common for the sensors to accumulate grime and small bits of metal gently wipe the entire surface of the sensor rubbing away any visible dirt 7 x research source this is a fairly quick process and shouldn t take more than a minute even if you have to do it to each sensor the task should only take you an hour or so in total use a wire brush or file to gently grind away stubborn rust or dirt be careful if you do choose to do this as excessive cleaning could damage the sensor don t use a lot of pressure instead go over the specific section repeatedly with a light touch until it comes clean 8 x research source this most often needs to be done with older vehicles and with sensors that show a lot of rust push the sensor back into place so the wiring is exactly as it was before once the sensor is cleaned gently reposition it and push it down to make sure it is securely in place if you have a hard time getting it back in there may be a blockage of some sort try blowing canned air into the hole again 9 x research source avoid twisting or screwing the sensor that could damage it replace the bolt and twist it to secure the sensor in place get the bolt out of the small bowl where you placed your lug nuts put the bolt over the abs sensor and tighten it with a wrench 10 x research source when you get to the end and start to feel resistance give the bolt just one final twist you want it to be on tightly enough that it won t come loose but you also don t want it to be too hard to remove the next time you need to clean the abs sensors reposition the wheel and screw the lug nuts back in place place the wheel back on the tire hub put all the lug nuts back on taking care to make sure they are all tightly screwed on once the wheel is back in place you can disengage the car jack 11 x research source you can probably use your hands to start screwing on the lug nuts but finish them off with a wrench repeat the process on each wheel until the abs light no longer lights up after you finish the first tire go ahead and start your vehicle and check if the abs light is gone if so you fixed the problem on the first try if not tackle the next wheel with a sensor 12 x research source if you were able to check an abs scanner before beginning this project you may already know exactly which wheel was the problem if the abs light is still coming on after all the sensors are cleaned there may be an internal or wiring problem visit an auto body shop to have the fault code read to see what else needs to be done,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to fit a racechip,if you are the kind of person who likes getting the most out of their car a racechip is perfect for you a racechip is an electric monitor that optimizes engine performance giving your car more power while also saving fuel it fits between the motor controls and sensors on your engine install it by detaching the existing plugs from the engine and hooking them to the monitor instead for most cars the installation takes about 15 minutes and doesn t require any tools or mechanical expertise a racechip is perfectly safe and can make driving a more enjoyable experience 1 x research source,wait about 10 minutes for the engine to cool if the car has been driven recently the engine gets very hot and won t be safe to touch until then keep your car off in the meantime once you re ready to begin the installation place your hand near the engine first if you feel any heat coming off of it give it a little more time to cool down 2 x research source the wait time varies depending on how recently you have driven the car if you just drove a long distance give it at least 30 minutes to cool down open the hood to access the engine bay pull the hood opening lever inside your car it is located on the driver s side typically below the dashboard and near the door after popping the hood get out of the car and lock the doors prop up the hood so you have a clear view of the engine 3 x research source locking the doors is useful to prevent anyone from accidentally turning on the car while you re working if you have an electronic engine starter set it in a secure spot away from the car as well remove the clips or bolts to detach the engine cover the engine is covered by a piece of black plastic in most vehicles it is usually pinned in place with small plastic clips find the clips along the top surface of the lid then pull them up to remove them if your cover has bolts instead use a 4 mm 0 16 in socket wrench instead 4 x research source on some vehicles removing the cover is a little more complicated you may have to detach the sensors and intake valve due to them being connected to the cover check the owner s manual for more information some vehicles have a cover without attachments that can simply be pulled up by hand others may not have a cover at all locate the turbo boost pressure sensor on top of the engine look along the rear part of the engine for a big black plug the plug is usually near the upper right corner of the engine the plug has a round flexible black cord as well 5 x research source when you order a racechip the manufacturer asks what car you have if you give them the make and model they include directions with full images showing where the sensor plugs are it s very useful if you re having trouble finding them on your own pull the turbo sensor plug out from its connector check the top edge of the plug for a small tab grip the back end of the plug while holding the tab down with one finger then pull the plug away from the connector the tab disengages the plug so it will slide straight off the connector 6 x research source be gentle with the plug to ensure the tab doesn t break if it feels stuck don t force it make sure you have the tab pressed down then pull out with firm pressure if the plug is unreachable you may need to disconnect some other parts first sometimes the air filter and intake tube are in the way for instance and can be unscrewed with a socket wrench insert the racechip plug marked a into the connector if you have a gas engine take the racechip s wiring harness out of the box then inspect the different plugs for letter markings the end marked a will have a plug and socket attached line up the plug with the turbo boost pressure sensor outlet then push it in until you hear it snap into place 7 x research source the plug only fits one way so you can t inadvertently install it the wrong way if it isn t lined up with the sensor it won t fit note that diesel engines are a little different if you have a diesel car the plug marked b is meant to fit into the turbo boost pressure sensor fit the old turbo boost connector into the racechip s socket use the socket on the end of the wiring harness marked a it s the one right next to the plug you placed into the connector snap the two together to finish installing the first end of the harness 8 x research source listen for the snap indicating that the plug and harness are well connected it s pretty loud so if you don t hear it it could mean that the plug is still loose push it in with a little more pressure while holding down its tab if it doesn t fit you may be using the wrong end of the cable double check the letter label find the manifold absolute pressure sensor if you have a gas engine this sensor is on the upper left part of the engine near the passenger side of your car it is a little smaller than the turbo sensor but it s not too tough to find it also has a black plug and cord connecting it to the rest of the vehicle 9 x research source check the instructions that came with the racechip the manufacturer includes an image showing exactly where the sensor is on your vehicle locate the common rail sensor if you have a diesel engine every diesel engine has a metal tube in its center the tube is known as the common rail and is easy to spot when you re looking down from above one end of the rail will have a round plug on it which is where the racechip s connector is meant to fit for some cars the plug will be in the center instead so check there if you don t see it on the ends of the rail 10 x research source one way to find the sensor is by following the fuel injection line running from the fuel tank to the engine the rail will have a large plastic ring called a union nut nearby the nut allows you to easily pull the plug off the sensor consult the manufacturer s instructions for more information it will have a picture showing where the sensor is on your specific vehicle model disconnect the plug from the sensor by pressing its tab look along the length of the pug for a small tab grasp the end of the plug while keeping one finger on the tab then pull the tab back from the sensor to disconnect it 11 x research source the manifold absolute pressure sensor on a gas engine is identical to the turbo boost pressure sensor you can refer to one to find the unlocking tab on the other slot the remaining racechip plug into the sensor pick up the opposite end of the wiring harness it will have a plug and a socket to fit the plug align it with the sensor outlet then push it onto the sensor until you hear it click into place 12 x research source if you re working on a gas engine car use the end of the wiring harness marked b for a diesel plug use the one marked a instead the plug is made to specifically fit the sensor so there is no way to install it incorrectly if it won t fit double check its alignment with the sensor outlet attach the sensor plug to the wiring harness outlet connecting the rest of the wiring harness leaves you with one last outlet take the old plug you detached from the sensor and slot it into the harness it will fit perfectly wiring the racechip into the vehicle s system 13 x research source make sure you re using the outlet next to the plug you used not the one at the opposite end of the wiring harness that one is meant for the turbo sensor the racechip should stay off at this point if it comes on then your car is still on turn off the car and unplug the racechip to reset it remove the deactivation plug from the wiring harness now you are ready to connect the racechip to the wiring harness the wiring harness has an extra plug in the center but it will be covered with a blocker locate the purple clip on the side and pull it away from the harness with the clip out you can pull the blocker off of the plug 14 x research source if you re unable to remove the plug check the removal clip or tab on the side make sure it has been pulled all the way out or held down save the deactivation plug in your car s glove box when you need to deactivate the racechip fit the plug back onto it connect the racechip to the wiring harness take the racechip out of the box and line it up with the plug on the wiring harness note the white sticker on the plug as well as the brand logo on the racechip make sure they are all facing the same side then slot the racechip onto the plug until it clicks into place 15 x research source the racechip won t fit unless it is turned the correct way align it properly with the plug before attempting to install it the racechip should not light up yet if it does you will get an error message unplug the racechip and double check that your car is off secure the mounting clips and cable ties to the racechip the racechip comes with 4 mounting clips and a couple of cable ties you can use to hang it inside your car snap the mounting clips into the small openings on the back of the racechip positioning them in the corners slide a large cable tie through the upper and lower clips on the left then do the same with the right side 16 x research source the clips are detachable if you need to move the racechip pull the clips off of the car instead of cutting the cable ties you can then rehang the racechip with the old ties select a stable spot along the side of the engine bay for the racechip look around the edges of the engine bay for a clear spot to hang the racechip find a spot where you can use the cable ties many vehicles have exposed metal bars on the frame or holes you can slide the cable ties through tighten the cable ties so that the racechip won t move while you re driving 17 x research source remember to keep an eye on the wiring harness make sure you are able to safely route it through the engine bay and keep it out of the way of any moving parts use cable ties to secure the wiring harness in the engine bay try resting the wire harness on top of the connecting cables along the back of the engine bind it to the other cables using the smaller wire ties included with the racechip test the cable afterward to ensure it is well secured and out of the way of the engine components then trim excess length off the ties with wire cutters 18 x research source be careful to avoid stretching the cable too tightly too much tension could cause it to snap turn on the ignition to test the racechip turn the key in the ignition to activate the car without starting the engine the electrical systems such as the lights and radio will come on check the racechip as well to make sure that it is receiving power if it is working as intended reinstall the engine cover and close the hood then take your car out for a test drive to see how it handles with the new chip 19 x research source if the chip doesn t seem to be working turn off the car and check the plugs make sure the wiring harness is well connected to the sensors if you need assistance

how to test a temperature sensor with a multimeter,your vehicle s temperature sensor is an important component of your engine s cooling system so if you re having problems with your car or truck overheating you may have a faulty sensor luckily replacing a temperature sensor is as simple as plugging in a new one however you should test your sensor first to make sure that s where the problem lies and you don t have a deeper issue that needs to be repaired with your handy multimeter you can easily take a few readings that will tell you if your sensor is functioning properly,place your vehicle in park turn off the engine and pop the hood put your vehicle in park so it s stable and won t roll and take the key out of the ignition so you won t accidentally shock yourself open up your hood so you re able to access your engine compartment and make sure it stays open 1 x research source if you were recently driving your vehicle wait about 15 minutes to let your engine cool down so you don t burn yourself locate your temperature sensor next to your thermostat follow your upper radiator hose towards the engine at the end of the hose is the thermostat housing attached to the thermostat or installed right next to it is the temperature sensor which looks like a small black device plugged into a wire harness 2 x research source the location of your vehicle s temperature sensor may vary depending on your make and model but generally it s located next to your thermostat on your engine block if you re working on a truck with a large engine the thermostat may be located behind the metal cylinder on top of the engine block known as the intake plenum you ll need a professional to remove the intake plenum without damaging your engine unplug the sensor and remove it from the vehicle use 1 hand to hold the wire harness and your other hand to pull on the body of the sensor gently slide it out of the harness so you don t damage any of the wiring and place the sensor on a flat working surface like a desk or table 3 x research source attach the multimeter leads to the outer connectors on the sensor on the plug end of the temperature sensor are 3 connectors that look like metal prongs take your red lead and clip it to 1 of the connectors on the far right or far left then clip your black lead to the connector on the far side across from your red lead so they aren t touching each other 4 x research source the connectors are used to plug the sensor into the wire harness if the leads are touching you won t get an accurate reading most temperature sensors have 3 connectors but some may have 5 no matter how many connectors always attach the leads to the ones on the outside to keep them spaced apart fill a cup or small container with ice and water take a clean cup and fill it with about 6 fluid ounces 180 ml of clean water and add few ice cubes to bring down the temperature wait a few minutes to allow the ice to chill down the water 5 x research source the cold water will serve as a reference measurement for your sensor use a thermometer to make sure the water is 33 f 1 c after a few minutes use a digital or analog thermometer to take a temperature reading of the water if the water is around 33 f 1 c then you re good to go if not wait another 2 3 minutes to allow the ice to cool it down further then take another reading 6 x research source turn on your multimeter and set it to dc with your temperature sensor still attached to the multimeter press the power button to activate it locate the dc setting on the dial of the sensor and turn the dial to select it or select the dc setting if your multimeter doesn t have a manual dial 7 x research source the dc setting will give you a voltage reading that you can use to test your sensor submerge the sensor in the water and take a reading gently lower the end of the sensor into the water until the entire device is fully submerged wait a minute or so for the screen to give you a reading of the cold water once you have a reading write down the measurement for reference 8 x research source a common reading for a temperature sensor in cold water is around 5 volts move the sensor to a cup of boiling water and take another reading heat up roughly 6 fluid ounces 180 ml of water in a kettle or in a pot on the stove until it s boiling then pour the water into a mug or container submerge your temperature sensor in the hot water and wait a few seconds to let your multimeter take a reading write down your reading so you can easily reference it 9 x research source a hot water reading should give you around 25 volts 10 x research source make sure the cup you use is able to hold boiling water safely be careful not to burn your fingers in the hot water compare your readings to the correct readings for your vehicle every make and model uses a specific temperature sensor which will give you specific readings whenever you test them with a multimeter look online for the hot and cold readings of your vehicle s temperature sensor and compare your readings to see if they closely match if they do your sensor is functioning properly and you may have an issue elsewhere if not you ll need to replace your sensor 11 x research source for example if your vehicle s temperature sensor is supposed to have around 5 volts in a cold reading check your measurements to see if yours closely match the correct reading,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to paint an engine block,the engine block refers to the metal and plastic casing surrounding the components in your engine when people talk about painting an engine they re really just talking about painting the engine block since you can t get paint on the components anyways painting an engine is not a casual diy project it is one of the harder things for a gearhead to safely and cleanly do since the engine block is surrounded by ports valves and components that need to remain unpainted you have to tape and cover all of the little pieces sticking out of the engine if you do not know how your engine works or what the specific components are you re safer off paying a professional to paint the engine for you depending on how many layers of paint and primer you use and whether you re removing the engine or not this process can take anywhere from 2 4 days,remove the engine if you know how to assemble an engine bay it is easier to paint an engine if you can easily maneuver around it and have space to work but you should only be taking the engine out if you re a gearhead that knows how to put it back together you can still paint the engine without removing it but it s ideal if you can get it out 1 x research source while the process for removing an engine changes from vehicle to vehicle it typically involves removing the oil lines alternator radiator hoses radiator compressor and battery then you slide the hoses and cooling lines out of the engine before disconnecting the intake and power steering set the engine on a stool under a drop cloth if you removed it set up a work stool or table under a drop cloth next to your vehicle carefully lift the engine up and out of the engine bay if your engine is heavy enlist help to do this set the engine down on top of the table or stool keep it oriented the same way it was arranged in your vehicle 3 x research source set the engine up outside if you can the paint and primer you re going to use are fairly toxic so it s best if you have tons of ventilation most people do not paint the bottom of the engine since nobody ever sees it so you don t need to move the engine around once you set it down take the battery out by the negative terminal first if you don t remove the engine you may shock yourself or short a wire if you don t disconnect the battery with your car off use a socket wrench to unscrew the bolt holding the negative terminal in place do this on the battery and engine to take the cable out repeat this process on the positive terminal then use a screwdriver to unscrew the base of the battery to unlock it from the housing unit and lift it out 4 x research source if you remove the positive cable first you will shock yourself and possibly destroy your battery 5 x research source wipe off any surface grime and built up oil with a cloth and brush wipe off the surface with a thick clean cloth to remove any chunks of oil or grease grab a stiff bristled brush and scrub the surfaces of the engine wipe around every exposed section of the engine to pull up surface dirt really get in there and wipe the engine thoroughly 4 5 times to remove any surface dirt 6 x research source the cleaner the engine is the better your paint job will look use cleaning wipes and degreaser to deep clean the engine mist the surface of the engine with a degreaser then use cleaning or baby wipes to carefully work the degreaser into the metal scrub around every knob bolt nut and valve you don t need to soak the engine or anything but you do need to carefully scrub the entire surface of the engine to remove the oil and built up grease 7 x research source gunk is the most popular brand when it comes to engine degreasers but sea foam and permatex are popular options as well you can use basically any degreaser though 8 x research source you can use soapy water instead of a degreasing product if your engine isn t particularly greasy or you want a less abrasive option if you aren t removing the engine cover the area surrounding the engine with trash bags to keep them from getting soaked slide the trash bags down as far as you can to protect the surrounding components from drips use a pipe cleaner to scrub under any wires pipes or sensitive components remove the degreaser and residue using a clean dry rag grab a clean rag and give the engine a through wiping to remove the residue from your degreaser carefully work the rag around every component to lift up any remaining dirt and oil this may take a while but your paint job won t look particularly good if you don t wipe away the degreaser particles 9 x research source wait at least 1 hour to give the engine time to air dry if it s still pretty wet you can degrease the engine with mineral spirits if you want a more natural option cover the engine bay with foil and tape if you aren t removing the engine put a plastic bag over any components that are sticking out of the engine use painter s tape to cover the nuts bolts and lining of your engine bay wrap aluminum foil around the pipes wires and thinner pieces that run around your engine use plastic drop cloths or trash bags to cover larger sections of the engine bay when you re done 10 x research source tape off the openings nuts and ports on your engine this process is different for every engine but a good rule of thumb is to cover every opening nut and port use strips of painter s tape to cover up any openings on the engine wrap every nut and bolt to keep the paint from joining the threads permanently if you didn t remove the engine wrap the junction where every valve and pipe attaches to your engine 11 x research source if your pistons are exposed wrap them thoroughly with painter s tape and a cut out piece of plastic to block the paint completely if you do not know what these parts look like you can refer to your user s manual or pull a diagram up online cover the valves and bolts on your water pump and block the spark plugs this is particularly important because getting paint in the water pump or spark plug can make your engine fail the water pump is typically buried under a cover on your timing belt cover every opening and bolt on the water pump 2 3 times with painter s tape pull the cables out of the spark plugs and fill each hole with balled up painter s tape before covering them entirely 12 x research source tape off the seam where the water pump connects to your engine as well the spark plugs are usually located on the top of the engine wrap the opening for the transmission or cover the junction thoroughly if you disassembled the engine put a plastic bag over the opening for the transmission and wrap the seam in painter s tape if you didn t take the engine out cover the gap where the engine connects to the transmission in 2 3 layers of painter s tape this is another opening that absolutely cannot get paint inside at risk of an engine failure 13 x research source put on a respirator protective eyewear and gloves the primer and paint you re going to use is noxious and you may irritate your lungs and eyes if you aren t properly protected put on a respirator cover your hair with a cap or head cover and wear long sleeve clothing wear protective goggles to keep the fumes out of your eyes put on nitrile gloves to keep the paint and primer off of your hands 14 x research source either open the door in your garage and turn some fans on or do this outside prime the engine carefully with a heat resistant vehicle primer purchase your primer at an auto shop online you must use a heat resistant vehicle primer to keep the heat from your engine melting the paint over time spray the entire surface of the engine using smooth back and forth strokes if you removed it if you didn t spray the surfaces that are exposed on the top and side of your engine block 15 x research source hold the nozzle 8 12 inches 20 30 cm away from the surface that you re painting if you re too close the primer will drip if you re too far the primer won t come out evenly you do not need to prime the engine if you re using a vht automotive paint wait 1 2 hours to give the primer time to dry once you ve applied your first layer of primer wait a few hours to give it time to dry the primer must cure to the surface of the engine directly but you won t know if any grease or residue cuts through the primer until it dries 16 x research source use additional coats of primer if the dried layer looks uneven once the primer is dry inspect the surface to see if it still looks even and uniform if there are bubbles or pockets where some grease cut through the primer apply another coat of the primer to the entire engine block repeat this process until the entire surface is evenly primed and covered 17 x research source pick up a heat resistant engine enamel to paint the engine if you cleaned and primed the engine properly the painting is the easiest part unfortunately you cannot use a standard paint to coat the engine stop by the auto supply store or go online and buy 2 cans of engine enamel in a color that will work with the color scheme of your vehicle 18 x research source if you don t use an engine enamel the paint will peel off over time as the heat melts the pigment coat the engine in a layer of engine enamel to paint it hold the nozzle up to the engine and cover the entire surface in a layer of engine enamel work back and forth from one end of the block to the other to coat the surface of your engine if you removed the engine work your way around the engine to paint the sides as well the color should be uniform and even without any drips 19 x research source if you did a good job covering up the ports and bolts this part should be fairly straightforward and easy wait 24 hours before applying any additional coats as needed give the engine enamel time to dry by letting it rest for a day when it s dry inspect the surface and feel the engine if the paint is even and there aren t any gaps in the texture you can stop here if you want to even out the color apply another layer of paint and wait an additional 24 hours before inspecting the surface again 20 x research source you can repeat this process 2 3 times to achieve a deeper color or more uniform texture remove all of the tape plastic and covers once the engine is dry begin peeling off all of the painter s tape that you applied before be thorough and make sure that you scrape off every piece of tape use a razor blade to peel up any pieces that have fused to the surface of the engine remove all of the plastic bags and trash bags you used to cover up and protect the other compartments of the engine bay as needed 21 x research source be extremely thorough here if you leave any plastic or tape in the engine bay it could ignite at some point when you re driving your car reassemble the engine based on how much you originally removed if you took the engine out set it back inside of the engine bay reconnect the transmission valves

how to install an rv handrail,in an rv you can go on the adventure of a lifetime however rvs have narrow steps that can be a little tough to navigate give yourself something to hold onto by installing a handrail you can install a new rail on the stairs with a couple of power tools if you re looking for something smaller bolt a wall mounted handrail directly to the wall of the rv there are also combination hand to floor rails that span from the rv to the lowest step you re going to cross your rv s stairs many times so finish the simple installation to travel in more comfort,fit the mounting bracket along the rv s bottom step open the rv s door and extend the steps then find a spot to fit the bracket for most handrails the bracket fits along the side of the upper step align the bracket with the top and side edge of the step 1 x research source some rails are meant to be installed along the bottom step instead if yours comes with a short thin bracket place it on the front edge of the lowest step the bracket can be placed on either the left or right side of the steps it depends on where you want the handrail to be drill a pair of 1 4 in 0 64 cm pilot holes through the steps fit the tip of a power drill through each of the holes on the bracket if you re installing a side mounted bracket drill all the way through the staircase s siding for a front mounted bracket drill about 2 in 5 1 cm deep enough to fit the screws some brackets may take more than 2 screws so drill additional holes as needed 2 x research source some brackets have an adhesive backing you can use to stick them in place during the installation if the bracket s holes line up with any already on the step you could also place a screw there temporarily secure the bracket to the step with 1 4 in 0 64 cm screws hold the bracket steady while fitting the screws through the holes if you mounted the bracket to the side of the steps have someone reach through the steps to slide the screws into the holes fit each hole with a separate screw there are usually about 5 of them to fill 3 x research source for front mounted brackets just screw the holes through the pilot holes with a cordless screwdriver this type of bracket is much easier to install and doesn t require extra hands place locking nuts on the ends of the screws if they are exposed on side mounted brackets the screws will be exposed on the outer part of the steps fit a 1 4 in 0 64 cm locking nut onto each screw these nuts are threaded like screws so turn them clockwise by hand until they stay in place then tighten them with a ratchet wrench or another tool 4 x research source front mounted brackets usually will not require locking nuts if the screws aren t exposed you won t have to worry about adding the extra security slide one leg of the handrail through the bracket the handrail is meant to fit through an opening along the top edge of the bracket slide it in then push it down as far as it will go the bracket will usually have an additional hole near the opening that aligns with a similar hole on the leg insert another screw and turn it clockwise by hand to hold the leg in position 5 x research source make sure the leg is well secured in the bracket if it isn t screwed in place it could slip back out when you re using it adjust the handrail to the desired height and set it on the ground pull off the metal clip on the handrail s other leg with the clip gone you can slide the leg out from the handrail look for a couple of holes on the leg after setting the handrail at a comfortable height slide the metal clip back through the holes and press the ends together to secure the leg in place 6 x research source removing the handrail is even simpler than the installation detach the clip and screw to detach the handrail you can then fold up the stairs without removing the bracket position the handrail next to the door on the rv step inside the rv to figure out where you want the handrail to be have someone else hold the handrail against the wall try placing the upper handrail bracket about 36 in 91 cm above the ground adjust the positioning if the positioning doesn t feel comfortable to you there 7 x research source handrails are usually designed to be placed to your left when you re standing at the bottom of the steps that positioning enables the rail to swing closed when it isn t in use mark the bracket screw holes in pencil on the rv s wall hold the rail in place with the brackets firmly pressed against the rv most handrails have 2 brackets with 3 screw holes each make sure all of the marks are visible so you know where to drill for the installation 8 x research source with some handrails you will be able to drill through the holes without removing the brackets it makes the process a little quicker since you don t have to rely on pencil marks to figure out where to drill drill a pair of 1 4 in 0 64 cm wide pilot holes through the wall use a power drill to create holes through each of the marks you made make the holes 2 to 3 in 5 1 to 7 6 cm deep depending on the length of the screws included with the handrail drill carefully to avoid causing any unnecessary damage to the rv s exterior most brackets use 2 screws but some may require you drill additional holes 9 x research source you can size pilot holes with tape measure about 2 in 5 1 cm up from the tip of the drill bit place tape there then drill when the tape reaches the wall the bit will be 2 in 5 1 cm inside of it fill the holes with rv silicone to stop leaks from forming to ensure you don t end up with water breaching the comfort of your rv use a product labeled as safe for use with recreational vehicles fit the canister inside a caulk gun then cut open the nozzle with sharp scissors apply the silicone directly to the holes filling each of them until they are level with the rest of the rv s exterior paneling 10 x research source if you are able to have someone hold the handrail in place then add the silicone through the brackets fill the bracket holes for a thicker layer of sealant to guard against moisture rv silicone is sold online by rv suppliers and at many hardware stores make sure you re using an rv product instead of a household one you could also use an rv sealant or caulk screw the brackets to the rv with 1 4 in 0 64 cm wide screws place the handrail back on the rv before the sealant has had time to dry have someone hold the handrail still while you secure each bracket use the screws that came with your handrail which are usually galvanized screws 2 to 3 in 5 1 to 7 6 cm in length sink them through the bracket holes and into rv s wall with a cordless screwdriver 11 x research source if you re working on your own try placing some of the screw by hand to help pin the handrail to the wall then tighten the screws one by one to finish the installation since it is screwed in place the rail will generally be safe to use right away however for safety let the sealant dry for 24 hours if you are able to wait before using the rail position the bracket in front of the bottom step combination rails usually have a small lower bracket that fits on the front edge of the lowest step align it with the edge and side of the step make sure it is positioned no more than 1 in 2 5 cm to the right or left of the door so that you will have room for the upper bracket 12 x research source you can place the rail on either side of the steps but it typically fits well on the right install the bracket by making 1 4 in 0 64 cm pilot holes and screws the bracket usually has room for 2 screws fit a 1 4 in 0 64 cm drill bit into the holes and drill about convert 2 in cm abbr on deep then secure the bracket in place with matching 1 4 in 0 64 cm screws these screws are included with the handrail 13 x research source test out the handrail s positioning before screwing any holes through the rv make sure you know exactly where you want the rail to be and have the mounting brackets positioned correctly to match screw the upper handrail to the rv s wall position the handrail in a spot where you can comfortably reach it while you re walking down the steps then drill 1 4 in 0 64 cm wide pilot holes through the handrail bracket the bracket will usually have 2 slots for screws so make 2 pilot holes to match while the bracket is in place fill its screw holes with rv silicone to seal against leaks then use the included screws to finish securing the bracket in place 14 x research source stand inside the rv while testing the handrail s positioning you can have someone hold the rail steady while you determine the best spot for it keep the upper bracket next to the door and aligned with the lower one you placed on the steps combination handrails are meant to be placed on the left when you re standing at the bottom of the steps position the third leg so it is level with the bottom of the door frame combination rails have an extra arm to screw to the rv for extra stability swing the arm out from the handrail moving it towards the back end of the rv make sure it s level with either the door frame of the rv s interior flooring if it s in the wrong spot the rail may feel a little wobbly while you re using it 15 x research source if you have an rv that opens in the back attach the third arm to any solid spot you can find try placing it on the kick panel the strip of material right between the door frame and bumper drill a couple of 1 4 in 0 64 cm wide holes through the bracket detach the leg from the bracket by sliding out the metal clip binding them together locate the holes usually 2 of them on the ends of the clip you can use those holes to make the pilot holes without having to do any sort of measuring make the pilot holes about 2 in 5 1 cm deep 16 x research source check the bracket to see if it has a sticky backing you can use to keep it in place while you re drilling if it doesn t hold onto it or have someone else do it for you if you re having trouble working with the bracket mark the screw holes with pencil remove the bracket then drill the pilot holes use 1 4 in 0 64 cm wide screws to attach the bracket to the rv s wall add the screws to each of the pilot holes you made with a cordless screwdriver rotate the screws clockwise until they are flush with rv check all the brackets afterward to ensure that they are stable 17 x research source measure carefully when installing the brackets to avoid causing unnecessary damage to the rv s exterior if you make a mistake fill it in with sealant attempt to move the brackets to test their stability if they feel loose make sure the screws have been well tightened clip the third leg to the bracket to finish installing the handrail swing the leg back and slide it through the bracket look for holes on both the leg and bracket after aligning the holes slip the clip through and press its ends closed to finish the installation make any final adjustments needed then walk the rv s steps in comfort with your new rail 18 x research source combination rails usually have adjustable bands on the legs rotate the bands clockwise to tighten the legs and keep them steady during use when you re ready to pack up the rail remove the metal clips to detach the legs from the brackets the brackets stay in place so you can easily reassemble the handrail next time you wish to use it,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to become a panel beater,dings and dents are unavoidable when you own a car but panel beaters know how to deal with them panel beaters work with metal and fiberglass vehicle frames to make them look good as new professionals identify frame damage fit replacement parts and apply new finishes to vehicles although there are no official education requirements for this career many panel beaters get their start through technical training and an apprenticeship you can also obtain certification to open up new employment opportunities panel beaters are always in demand since they play an important role in keeping vehicles looking their best,work toward completing high school or getting your ged panel beating doesn t have much in the way of educational requirements for you to consider still earning your diploma or ged can open up new opportunities some employers and training programs require it while you re in school take advantage of any technical training classes available 1 x research source the ged is a test you can take if you don t finish high school it shows that you have the equivalent of a high school education since there are no official educational requirements you may still be able to get training and find a job even if you don t have a diploma or ged to show for it join a vocational program if your school has one attending a vocational program enables you to get some hands on training with cars many high schools offer technical classes or have partnerships with schools that do if your school doesn t offer separate panel beater training get involved with an auto body repair study program you could also begin training as an automotive mechanic to get some experience 2 x research source speak with your school counselor to see what kinds of classes are available to help you prepare for panel beating take a 1 year training program if you need more experience technical and community colleges offer training programs for prospective panel beaters check with colleges around your area to see what kind of programs they offer a 1 year program is designed to teach you the basics of panel beating and give you a chance to gain some experience many programs have work placement opportunities to help you land a job after you graduate college training is a great option for anyone who didn t get vocational training in high school that includes anyone looking to transition to panel beating from another field while you re training speak with the school s academic advisor to ensure you take the correct classes and have access to any work placement opportunities the school offers take a 2 year auto body repair program if you want additional training many technical and community colleges offer a 2 year associate s degree in auto repair technology the extra training is very useful for anyone who wishes to learn more about vehicles and the more extensive repairs needed to fix some of them it may also cover repairing serious collision damage or other car parts a lot of panel beaters don t normally deal with some programs also include classes on language math and other subjects that come in handy during your work 3 x trustworthy source us bureau of labor statistics u s government agency that collects and reports labor related information go to source getting a degree usually isn t necessary for panel beaters but it can be useful if you don t have a lot of experience working on cars it may also help you qualify for management roles there are also some 4 year programs for example some technical schools offer bachelor s degrees in automotive technology note that most schools that offer degrees also have work placement programs to help you land an apprenticeship you can complete your apprenticeship while earning your degree apply to companies with open apprenticeships search for auto repair workshops in your area and check out what openings they have available look for ones that are willing to train new employees you can usually submit applications online either through company websites or job posting sites 4 x research source you could also call different workshops or visit them in person if you express a strong interest in panel beating and have the training you should be able to find a job applying for apprenticeships can be a competitive process so don t give up if you don t get one right away if you attended a college or technical training program consult your advisor your school can link you to prospective employers complete a 4 year apprenticeship to learn the trade an apprenticeship gives you on the job training to prepare you to work on your own expect to start out with tasks like helping a more experienced panel beater fix small dents before moving on to tougher repairs you won t be able to do repair work on your own until you re trained 5 x research source the length of the apprenticeship period can vary depending on where you are in the world at a minimum expect jobs to require at least 2 years of professional experience get hired full time after completing your apprenticeship many companies hire apprenticeships directly after they finish their training you could also apply to other workshops if you wish to seek new opportunities you won t need to repeat the apprenticeship period elsewhere consider also obtaining certification to make your new career official if you have training experience you can get hired at just about any workshop however continue advancing your credentials and staying up to date with the latest technology apply for certification if it is available in your country you do not have to get a license to start working as a panel beater but you may need to get a certificate certificates are generally earned by completing a school training program or finishing an internship you may then have to apply to a government board or professional organization to receive professional certification 6 x trustworthy source us bureau of labor statistics u s government agency that collects and reports labor related information go to source professional certification is like proof of your skills as a panel beater certified beaters are more likely to advance to higher roles in a workshop and receive pay raises for example if you re in the u s look into getting certification from the national institute for automotive service excellence ase take a test if it is needed to qualify for certification testing organizations like the ase offer many different types of certification so choose the one that best applies to your work ase certification tests are computer based and typically consist of 50 to 60 multiple choice questions they are meant to measure how much you know about panel beating or another subject the test covers you can retake the test every 30 days 7 x research source for example the b series of tests covers collision repair including damage analysis repair and refinishing these tests are often good places for a panel beater to start when pursuing certification in a region like western australia you will have to get a motor vehicle repairer s certificate this certificate is required for work and requires you to complete a test similar to the ase 8 x research source get recertified every 5 years if it is required when your certification expires reactivate it by taking a recertification test the test is similar to the one you take when you initially get certified it is used to prove that you have the knowledge of a skilled professional be aware of any changes that have happened in automotive technology since you last took a certification test 9 x research source recertification is necessary because panel beating changes over time you may come across new technology or techniques in your work which can then show up on a certification test be sure to read up about any new technology that could impact your score on the recertification test,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to read flat key signatures,when you re reading a piece of sheet music the key signature tells you what key the song is in the beauty of a key signature is that sharps and flats that are part of the key don t have to be marked in the music this makes the piece much cleaner and easier to read with a flat key signature simply look at the next to last flat to identify the major key of the song once you ve determined the key you can also play the scale 1 x research source,spot the key signature on a piece of sheet music near the treble clef when you look at a piece of sheet music the key signature is just to the left of the treble clef on the top staff if you ve got a flat key signature there will be a series of flats that represent the notes that are played as flats throughout the piece 2 x research source having a key signature doesn t mean you won t see any flats or sharps in the music you ll likely still see a few these are flats or sharps that don t occur in the key the song is in the natural sign might also be used when you see this sign in the music it tells you to play the note s natural tone not the sharp or flat that it would normally be in that key read the flats from left to right the key signature is read from left to right just like the rest of the sheet music the flats are always presented in the same order in a key signature b e a d g c f 3 x research source recall that on a music staff there are 5 lines and 4 spaces each of these lines and spaces represents a white key on a piano you can remember the notes represented by the 5 lines from the bottom to the top with the mnemonic every good boy does fine the spaces represent notes that spell the word face when read from bottom to top altogether the notes on a musical staff from bottom to top are e f g a b c d e f when you read out the notes in a scale the flats will likely be in a different order than they are in a key signature just keep in mind that they re always notated in the same order in the key signature regardless of where they occur in the scale find the second to last flat to determine the major key on the key signature circle the second to last flat from the end the note of that flat is the major key that the key signature represents 4 x research source for example suppose you have a key signature with a b flat an e flat an a flat a d flat and a g flat since the d flat is the second to last flat in the key signature the song is in the key of d flat major if it s easier for you try writing out the letters that represent the order of the flats then circle the flats that are included in the key signature the second to last letter you circled is your major key this trick only works for major keys not for minor keys finding the minor key will be easier if you memorize the 15 major keys first go down a minor third from the major key to find the minor key each of the 15 major keys has a corresponding or relative minor key that uses the same key signature if you know the major key you can figure out the minor key by taking that note down 3 half steps or 1 whole step and 1 half step the note you land on is the name of the minor key for that key signature 5 x research source as an easy example look at the key of c major which has no sharps or flats the distance from c down to b is a half step because no notes fall between them however the distance between b and a is a whole step you only need to go down 1 whole step and 1 half step which you ve just done so your relative minor key is a minor if you find this difficult look at the major scale the sixth note in the major scale is the relative minor to continue the same example a c major scale is c d e f g a b c the sixth note is a so the relative minor of c major is a minor identify whole and half steps to understand scale step patterns if you re new to music theory and reading sheet music you might not be familiar with whole and half steps but don t worry the concept is relatively simple a step is an interval which is the distance between 2 notes a half step is the smallest distance and occurs between 2 notes that have no other notes between them a whole step is 2 half steps away from the original note 6 x research source whole and half steps are easier to visualize if you think of a piano keyboard for the white keys that have black keys between them the black keys are half steps and the white keys are whole steps the space between two white keys that have a black key between them is a whole step there are 2 white keys on a piano keyboard that don t have a black key between them b and c since there s no black key these 2 notes are only a half step apart use the major step pattern to create a major scale from the key signature start your major scale from the note that lends its name to the key from there play up or down following the pattern of w w h w w w h where w is a whole step and h is a half step 7 x research source for example the scale for the key of c flat major is c flat d flat e flat f flat g flat a flat b flat and c flat it follows the same pattern as the c major scale except that you start on c flat instead of on c a scale that moves from the highest note to the lowest note is a descending scale if you move from the lowest note to the highest note you re playing an ascending scale adjust the major scale pattern to create the relative minor scale any minor scale also involves whole and half steps but it looks a little different from the major scale pattern the relative minor scale follows a step pattern of w h w w h w w 8 x research source you don t have to memorize a new step pattern if you already know the major step pattern recall that you can find the relative minor scale by looking at the sixth note on the major scale to make the minor scale pattern simply start with the 6th step and follow the step major step pattern from there since the sixth note in the c flat major scale is a flat it follows that a flat minor is the relative minor scale for c flat major all the notes of the scale are the same except that you start and end with an a flat so the scale of a flat minor is a flat b flat c flat d flat e flat f flat g flat and a flat,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to replace suspension springs,suspension springs also known as suspension coils are large metal springs attached to your vehicle that help to absorb the impact of the road and support the weight of your vehicle over time they can wear down and break and they need to be replaced in order for your vehicle to safely operate it s possible for you to replace them yourself but it s extremely important that you safely keep the springs compressed using special devices called spring compressors don t attempt this task without spring compressors because you could injure yourself or someone else,park the vehicle on level ground and engage the parking brake find a nice even spot to park your vehicle such as a driveway or garage if the vehicle is a standard or manual transmission pull the parking brake to engage it if it s an automatic transmission locate the parking brake near the driver side door and step on or push it to engage it 1 x research source working on an angled surface will make it difficult for you to access the suspension spring loosen the lug nuts on the tire you plan to remove with a tire iron take a standard tire iron and connect it to 1 of the lug nuts on the tire turn it just enough to loosen the lug nut but don t remove it loosen all of the lug nuts on the tire 2 x research source if your vehicle has a hubcap that s covering the lug nuts you ll need to remove it by prying the corner with a flathead screwdriver it s much easier to loosen the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle slide a jack beneath the axle near the tire and raise it up use a standard vehicle jack and locate the vehicle s axle on the underside near the tire you plan to remove slide the jack beneath the vehicle and place the top of it against the axle crank or turn the jack to raise it until the bottom of the tire is suspended about 2 3 inches 5 1 7 6 cm in the air 3 x research source the vehicle only needs to be jacked up enough to make it possible to remove the tire remove the lug nuts and slide the tire off of the vehicle with your hands or using the tire iron unscrew all of the lug nuts from the tire then use both of your hands to grip the outside of the tire and pull it off of the vehicle set the tire and lug nuts off to the side 4 x research source most vehicles have tires with between 5 and 6 lug nuts use a socket wrench to unscrew the bolt attaching the shocks to the spring the shocks of your vehicle look like a metal shaft with a tube wrapped around it and they re connected to the metal struts that also hold the suspension spring take a socket wrench and remove the bolt at the connection point between the shocks and the struts then use your hands to move the shocks off to the side so they re out of the way 5 x research source if you re having trouble finding the shocks look for the suspension spring coiled around the strut then look for the shaft that s connected to the strut unscrew the bolt connecting the sway bar to the spring with a socket wrench the sway bar is a metal rod that s connected to your vehicle s struts and helps to stabilize it whenever you take sharp turns locate the sway bar and find where it s connected to your vehicle s struts use a socket wrench to remove the bolt connecting them together and then use your hands to move the sway bar out of the way 6 x research source you may need to pull the sway bar off of the struts once you remove the bolt attach 2 spring compressors to the outside of the suspension spring spring compressors look like thin clamps with hooks on each in that keep your spring compressed so you can safely remove it hook a spring compressor over the top and bottom of the spring then hook another spring compressor directly across from it 7 x research source you need to use 2 spring compressors in order to safely keep the spring under tension you can find spring compressors at auto supply shops and online tighten the compressors with a wrench or drill until the spring separates fit a socket wrench impact wrench or a drill with a socket attachment over the screw end of the compressor and rotate it to tighten it alternate back and forth between both compressors and tighten them a little at a time so they compress the spring evenly continue compressing the spring until it separates from the strut 8 x research source make sure the spring is evenly compressed after it separates pull the compressed spring off of the vehicle remove the wrench or drill from the compressor and take a firm grip on the spring with your hands pull the spring off of the vehicle and place it on the ground 9 x research source you may need to push down on the control arm beneath the spring in order to pull it off of the vehicle loosen the compressors to remove them from the spring use your wrench or drill to slowly loosen the compressors a little bit at a time alternating back and forth between them so the spring is decompressed evenly once the compressors are loose enough remove them from the spring 10 x research source attach the spring compressors to the new spring and tighten them place the new spring on the ground and hook each of the compressors over the top and bottom of the spring directly across from each other use a wrench or drill to tighten the compressors a little bit at a time alternating back and forth between them so the tension is applied evenly to the spring continue compressing the spring until it can fit into the slot on the vehicle 11 x research source hold the compressed spring up to the slot where you need to fit it to see if it s compressed enough slide the compressed spring onto the vehicle until it clicks into place remove the wrench or drill and fit the compressed spring into the slot you removed the old one from on the vehicle slide the spring into place and turn it until it fits neatly and clicks into place 12 x research source it s very important that the spring is fit into place correctly in order for it to support the weight of the vehicle reattach the sway bar and shocks and replace the bolts to secure them connect the sway bar back to the struts of the vehicle and tighten the bolt with a socket wrench so it s secure then reconnect the shocks to the struts by reinstalling the screw that you removed with a socket wrench until it s tight 13 x research source all of the attachments around the spring need to be tight and secure so the spring doesn t fly off when you remove the tension remove the spring compressors with a wrench or drill take your wrench or drill and slowly loosen the 2 spring compressors by alternating back and forth between them easing a small amount of tension at a time so the spring is decompressed evenly when they re loose enough use your hands to remove the spring compressors 14 x research source the spring should be firmly held in place put the tire back on the vehicle and tighten the lug nuts slide the tire back onto the vehicle and use your hands to screw on the lug nuts as far as you can when you can t turn the lug nuts any further by hand use your tire iron to tighten 1 lug nut as much as you can then tighten the lug nut across from it continue tightening the lug nuts in a star shaped pattern so the tire is attached evenly 15 x research source lower the vehicle and remove the jack rotate the rod in the opposite direction to lower the vehicle the ground lower the jack all the way so the tire is on the ground and you can slide the jack out from underneath the vehicle 16 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to clean your driving record,wouldn t you like to go back in time to when you had a clean driving record no speeding tickets lower car insurance rates fortunately you might be able to some states let you expunge violations from your driving record if you meet certain requirements alternately you might be able to remove convictions or points by taking a driver safety course ideally you will keep convictions and points from piling up on your driving record in the first place,pull a copy of your driving record you need to see what is on your driving record before you go about removing violations you can get a copy of your record in the following ways 1 x research source order from your nearest department of motor vehicles stop in or look on the website many states let you order a copy of your driving history in person or online you usually have to pay a fee order online the website dmv com has partnered with backgroundchecks com they are not affiliated with your state government but you can order a copy of your driving record from their website for a fee contact your auto insurer who typically can provide you with a free copy identify how long offenses stay on your record each state decides how long a traffic violation will stay on your record for example in minnesota serious speeding violations 15 mph over the limit stay on your record for 15 years 2 x research source in washington most convictions stay on your record for five years however alcohol related convictions and vehicular assault homicide convictions stay on your record for life 3 x research source look on your state s dmv website to see if you can find this information ask the dmv if you can remove convictions it s up to every state whether they will expunge convictions from your driving record or not oklahoma for example will not remove convictions instead they make you wait three years for the convictions to fall off your record you may need to fulfill certain prerequisites in order to get your convictions removed such as completing a state approved driver improvement course and maintaining a clean driving record for a certain period of time this varies by state 4 x research source check that you meet the requirements the dmv should let you know what requirements you must meet for example in maryland you must satisfy the following 5 x research source three years without another conviction for a moving violation or criminal offense involving a motor vehicle no license suspension or revocation no conviction for dwi dui or failing to remain at the scene of a crime that results in death or bodily injury complete a request form your dmv will provide you with the form to fill out each state s form is different but you will generally be asked for the following information 6 x research source full name address date of birth driver s license number certification that you meet the requirements signature submit the required fee your state might require a fee for a manual expungement call the dmv ahead of time or check their website for the amount and acceptable methods of payment cash credit debit check your request will be reviewed and you should receive a decision in writing 7 x research source if you haven t heard anything after a couple of weeks contact the dmv check if a course removes points in some states you can have points removed from your driving record if you take a driver safety course also called a defensive driving course you should check before signing up for a course you might also be able to have tickets dismissed if you take a course 8 x research source if you ve received a ticket you can ask the judge in court whether you can take a driver safety course also check online your state s dmv website should tell you whether you can use a driver safety course to clean up your record confirm that you are eligible your state may limit who can use a defensive driving class to remove points or convictions from their records check with your dmv whether you are eligible for example states might give you a window of time to take the course if you wait too long then you can t take it 9 x research source other states might require that you elect to take the course when you pay the fine if you don t then you can t take the course find an appropriate course there are many courses offered but you need one that your state will accept ask if the state keeps a list of pre approved courses if so select a course from the list 10 x research source make sure the course works for your schedule if you don t attend then you won t clean up your record depending on your state you may be able to take the course online or in a classroom 11 x research source choose the best option that works for you however don t assume an online class will be easier you might find it harder to focus when taking a class online complete the course courses can last four to twelve hours and cover a variety of topics including alcohol or drug abuse traffic laws sharing the road and developing positive driving habits and attitudes 12 x research source make sure to get a certificate or some other proof that you have completed the course present your certificate to the dmv and keep a copy for your records document the surrounding circumstances another way to keep a clean driving record is to fight any tickets before they get on your record this is particularly important if you ve been charged with a dui or other offense that will stay on your record for a long time begin by documenting the circumstances surrounding your arrest what were you doing where was the officer what did the officer say did you consent to any search including a breathalyzer test did the officer ask for consent or immediately start searching your vehicle contact an attorney serious offenses like dui need serious legal help however you will also benefit from a traffic attorney even if you are fighting minor tickets you can find a traffic attorney by contacting your nearest bar association ask for a referral you ll have to pay for a lawyer so calculate whether the money is worthwhile if you are set to lose your license because of a dui then paying several thousand dollars might be worth it however paying that kind of money to fight a speeding ticket might not ask whether a lawyer will help coach you through the process most states let lawyers offer unbundled legal services under this arrangement the lawyer will do discrete tasks such as draft a discovery motion or give you advice about the strengths and weaknesses in your case 13 x trustworthy source national center for state courts non profit organization dedicated to improving judicial administration in the united states and around the world through education and advocacy go to source you then do all other tasks ask for discovery from the police you should be able to get certain documents from the police to help you prepare for trial in particular request the officer s notes these notes should contain information about why the officer stopped you 14 x research source the process of requesting these documents is called discovery usually you ll have to file a motion with the court check to see if there is a form you need to fill out if you don t know how to request discovery consult with a traffic attorney or hire the attorney and let them handle the case for you note that few defendants make discovery motions in traffic court your request may be ignored move for dismissal if the officer doesn t show up in some states you can get the case dismissed if the officer doesn t show up to testify against you 15 x research source in other states however the judge will reschedule the case if the officer doesn t show regardless you should still ask for a dismissal come up with a defense theory you can attack the state s evidence in a variety of ways carefully analyze your evidence and choose the best approach based on the facts 16 x research source attack the officer s observations the officer might not have been in a good position to accurately see what you were doing when possible introduce doubt as to the officer s vantage point for example if the officer was hidden behind a tree at night then they might not be 100 sure your car was speeding question the validity of any speed reading the officer might not have used the radar or laser properly question their training and whether they carefully calibrated the machine so that it would record speed accurately justify your actions as necessary you might have swerved into another lane to avoid a pedestrian or an erratic vehicle avoid excuses that don t work some defense theories won t work on a judge so don t try them for example avoid making any of the following arguments 17 x research source the officer is lying the judge won t believe you unless you have proof you claim everyone else was speeding that won t get you off the hook you argue no one was hurt so you shouldn t be held responsible you re being prosecuted to deter you from potentially harming someone in the future you claim you don t know what the law is ignorance of the law isn t an excuse it s best to simply apologize and illustrate how your behavior has changed since the incident if possible apologizing rather than getting defensive is likely to be most pleasing to the officer which may result in the dismissal of the case,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to park a truck or large vehicle,it s no secret that large vehicles handle differently than normal sized cars but when attempting to park in a spot or parking lot intended for vehicles of a more regular size you ll have to be especially careful with your large vehicle or truck the last thing you want is to accidentally damage other parked cars it s a good thing that some basic parking principles can help prevent this from happening,check your mirrors before parking poorly adjusted mirrors could result in you losing perspective while parking this can hurt your ability to gauge the distance between your vehicles and obstructions you ll want as clear and complete a view of the area around your vehicle as possible even if you are more confident in your parking skills you should always double check your blind spots to ensure you don t back into kids pedestrians or moving objects like strollers and shopping carts larger vehicles may have additional mirror mounted to the body of the vehicle to improve visibility these additional mirrors can be easily forgotten by casual large vehicle drivers check these regularly when parking 1 x research source give yourself plenty of space the more space you have to pull into your spot the more space you ll have to maneuver and make adjustments while parking you might give yourself more space by parking in an empty part of a parking lot or you could also choose a spot that is surrounded by smaller more compact vehicles smaller vehicles on either side of your large truck will take up less space in their own parking spot giving you more leeway as you park 2 x research source park slowly and brake early the increased weight of a large vehicle will require you to brake sooner than you would for a normal car especially if you have a heavy load you are transporting taking your time when parking your large vehicle can prevent costly errors like damaging cars around you or hitting a parking barrier 3 x research source pull in to wide open spots this is perhaps the safest route if you are less confidant in your large vehicle parking ability choose a location of the parking area that is free of other cars cut your wheel in the direction you are turning to move into the spot you may notice your front end swinging over the parking spot lines into the spot beside you this is due to the fact that larger vehicles require a wider turning radius to complete turns 4 x research source you may need to adjust your vehicle in your space after pulling in put your vehicle in reverse check your mirrors and blind spots then back up when you pull back into your spot after backing out adjust your wheel to straighten out your vehicle as you pull into the spot again avoid overshooting or undercutting your turn the length of your large vehicle will require more space spent turning for you to straighten it out and pull it evenly into its spot turning as you would normally in a regular car can lead to over or underturning potentially into other vehicles to prevent this you should 5 x research source maneuver your vehicle as far away from the parking spot as you are able the more space you have to approach the easier it will be for you to straighten your back end and pull into the spot cut your wheel hard in the direction of the spot you are parking you ll want the front end of your truck to enter the spot as straight as possible check your mirrors constantly while pulling into your spot the side of your vehicle may still be straightening and you ll need to keep a careful eye to ensure you do not bump or scratch other vehicles 6 x research source straighten your vehicle with a three point turn the more aligned your back end is with the spot you are aiming to park in the less turning you will have to do and the easier your parking job will be a three point turn is where you turn in one direction as far as you are able put your vehicle in reverse to straighten your front end and then finish your turn by continuing it 7 x research source you can use this while parking by pulling your front end close to one of the vehicles next to the spot in which you are parking putting your vehicle in reverse and straightening it to line up with your spot as much as possible be sure to check your mirrors and blind spots so you don t hit any pedestrians or cars parked behind you pull into your spot evenly out of your three point turn now that your car is more lined up with the spot it s likely you ll only have to make slight adjustments to your course as you pull into it executing this move in tight spaces is a valuable skill when driving a large vehicle so you may want to practice how to make a three point turn identify your backing up maneuver there are four main kinds of backing up maneuvers you might come across in your large vehicle driving straight back offset back alley dock and parallel parking each of these can be identified by the following characteristics straight back spots are usually located in a grid and form a perpendicular l shaped angle with the traffic passage that vehicles pass through to go deeper into or exit from the parking area offset back spaces are usually arranged in an offset grid these meet the traffic passage vehicles use to enter into or exit the parking area at a diagonal angle alley dock spaces are almost always for semi trucks these require you to move straight back through a narrow passage and then turn sharply to maneuver the trailer to meet a loading unloading dock which is usually at a right angle l shape to the passage parallel parking spaces are on the side of the road with either traffic obstacles or empty spaces before or after the spot these require you to back your vehicle in and can be especially challenging new drivers may want to avoid these if at all possible 8 x research source understand the mechanics of backing up this is going to be slightly different for semi trucks vehicles with a trailer versus large normal trucks that have a bed attached to the cab while large attached bed trucks will turn similarly to smaller vehicles you may be used to driving these will require plenty of extra room to complete the turn semi trucks vehicles with trailers will turn backwards opposite the direction you turn your wheel 9 x research source getting the hang of backing up a semi truck vehicle with a trailer requires time and practice you should consider finding an empty parking area and executing reverse maneuvers to get a feel for how your trailer responds to turning if you are are prepping for a driving test or expect to have to reverse your large vehicle into a space you should purchase some traffic cones from your local hardware store or set out some obstacles like a cheap folding chair in an empty parking area this way you can practice avoiding and guiding your trailer rear end around obstacles pull ahead of your spot you ll want to pull several feet ahead of your parking spot to make sure your turn doesn t cut too sharp and hit parked vehicles in the near side spot or swing wide and hit vehicles parked in the far side spot the more distance between your large vehicle and the parked cars means you will have more distance to straighten your rear end before approaching the parked vehicles this extra room can be the difference between scraping up another car and sliding into your spot without incident roll down your mirrors on both the driver and passenger side of your vehicle you want as clear and as unobstructed a view as possible of your mirrors do this especially it it s raining as raindrops can negatively impact your perspective or obstruct your view ask any passengers to step out of the vehicle even well behaved passengers can be difficult to see around while backing up a clear line of sight will help you prevent potential damage to your vehicle or others check your mirrors and do a walk around your mirrors should give you a general sense of the dimensions of the area you will be parking in however mirrors can sometimes distort distance or miss important features like thin metal signs posts and so on take note of the surroundings in your mirrors and step outside of your vehicle then compare your walk around evaluation of the parking area to your mirror view note any inconsistencies difficult to see obstacles or missed obstacles evaluate the size of the parking spot if you feel that the spot might not be a good fit or if you are nervous in your ability to park you are probably better off finding another parking spot adjust your mirrors upon returning to your vehicle now that you have a more complete idea of the area in which you are parking you can adjust your mirrors to give you a better perspective of the surrounding area you will be turning into your mirrors will normally be situated for straight traffic driving so adjusting these for a better parking view can help immensely 10 x research source swing out wide with your cab for attached bed trucks as well but especially for semi trucks vehicles with a trailer you should swing your front end in an outward arc away from your parking spot by cutting your wheel in the direction of the parking spot this will allow the rear end of your vehicle to cut sharply in the direction of the space you are attempting to park in once your rear end is angled diagonally into the spot straighten it by turning your wheel ¼ turn or less in the direction away from the spot the more space between you and the already parked vehicles obstacles surrounding the spot in which you are attempting to park the more time you ll have to align your rear end with the parking spot this will give you more space to make small adjustments and guide your rear end into the spot outside of your initial hard cut in the direction of the parking spot which began the hard turn of your rear end toward the spot you should only make slight adjustments while backing up large adjustments will likely result in over or under steering if you feel your angle of approach too far off you should pull out and start again you should keep a close eye on the front and rear end of your vehicle during these maneuvers while swinging out wide with your cab to angle your rear end into the spot it s easy to swing out into cars parked in spots across from the one you are backing into 11 x research source straighten out your cab once your rear end is aligned with the spot your cab will likely still be at an angle to it allow your rear end to travel a few more feet into the spot then turn your wheel in the direction you made your first hard cut in the direction of the spot this should begin straightening your cab without changing the angle of your rear end use gentle steering corrections at this point oversteering could result in the angle of your trailer rear end changing significantly some spots are too narrow or are at too sharp of an angle for you to back into in one attempt even experienced large vehicle drivers sometimes need several tries before their vehicle is in the right position when backing into a spot adjust your vehicle as necessary you may need to pull out of your spot straighten your vehicle one more time and reverse back into it nice and even when pulling out be careful your rear end does not cut short or wide into surrounding vehicles 12 x research source make use of designated large vehicle parking many main route establishments especially rest stops and designated trucker stops will have special parking spaces intended specifically for large vehicles like semis and moving trucks be on the lookout for places such as these as this kind of parking will make your job much easier 13 x research source some semi trucks can need as much as four times the space used by a normal sized car 14 x research source you might want to plan your route well in advance so that you know where you can park easily while on your trip a few popular sites that give comprehensive resources on roadway information are http www truckstops com http longhauler usa com know the legal expectations for large vehicles due to the fact that your large vehicle can block the view of smaller ones and sometimes create a dangerous blind spot on the road there are laws in place to prevent this from happening these laws will vary between state and country but generally you should never park on a road with a speed limit over 30 mph 48 kph unless your vehicle is disabled park in a way that blocks the view of the road from driveways and other streets park with your vehicle facing opposite the direction of traffic 15 x research source signal emergency stops soon after occurring when you are forced to stop on the side of a road due to mechanical issues or some other problem you must place emergency warning devices no later than ten minutes after coming to a stop different kinds of roads will require different placement of your warning devices such as on or near a one direction street or a divided highway you will need to place your warning devices at 10 100 and 200 feet 3 30 5 and 61 m behind your vehicle on a two lane road with traffic that moves in either direction or on an undivided highway you should place warning devices 10 feet 3 m in front of and behind the front and rear corners of your vehicle and 100 feet 30 5 m ahead of and behind your vehicle on bends curves and hills that obstruct the view of your warning devices you ll need to place your rearmost device so it can be clearly seen before the sight obstruction make a physical check of potential parking spots smaller parking lots and residential areas are built with smaller vehicles in mind the best way you can gauge the space of these places is by stepping out of your vehicle and getting a clear look of your surroundings 16 x research source if possible you should make use of a spotter who can direct you as you move into the spot safely 17 x research source use your parking break always larger vehicles are much heavier than your average sedan if your vehicle were to experience a critical brake failure its weight would make it even more dangerous to others if it started to roll you can easily prevent this from happening by always using your parking break as an extra safety measure 18 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to build trailers,a trailer is a type of cart that hitches to the back of a vehicle and is used to transport large items like furniture lumber landscaping equipment and more there are many trailer types but a common dimension for everyday needs is 6 feet 1 8 m by 4 feet 1 2 m this is sturdy enough for most household items but too small to haul vehicles to build this trailer construct the bed out of rectangular metal tubing from a hardware store weld these pieces together then build the cage and tailgate with metal pipe finally install the axle and wheels to complete your trailer,get four 2 in 5 1 cm x 3 in 7 6 cm pieces of rectangular steel tubing for the perimeter the perimeter pieces are the 4 pieces of metal that form the rectangle for the trailer s base for this trailer use 2 length pieces 6 feet 1 8 m long and 2 width pieces 4 feet 1 2 m long either buy 4 pieces cut to this length or buy a longer piece and cut it to size yourself 1 x research source for this trailer you ll need 20 feet 6 1 m or 240 inches 610 cm of steel total for the base buy enough to complete the job if you re building your trailer to different dimensions then adjust this step to meet your needs cut a 45 degree angle into the end of each perimeter piece use a protractor and measure a 45 degree angle into both sides of each perimeter piece make sure the angles on each base piece are facing the same direction then use a power saw or miter saw and cut the angle into each piece 2 x research source miter saws are best to use here because you can adjust the saw to the angle you want to cut this ensures you get a proper 45 degree angle most power saws can cut metal but be sure to use a blade designed for metal always wear goggles and gloves when cutting metal a welding mask would be even better because cutting metal produces sparks arrange the base pieces on a flat surface once the angles are cut lay out the trailer perimeter work on a flat surface like your driveway or garage floor lay out one of the 6 ft 1 8 m pieces then fit a 4 ft 1 2 m piece into each corner lay down the last 6 ft 1 8 m piece to complete the rectangle 3 x research source push the pieces together so there is as little space between them as possible if you aren t sure if you re working on a flat surface put a level on the floor and check weld the perimeter pieces together with the perimeter formed fasten the pieces together use a blowtorch or similar welding tool and weld along the corners of the rectangle weld all the areas you can reach first then let the metal cool down and flip it over so you can reach the bottom 4 x research source make sure there are no openings or holes in your weld spots this keeps water out and prevents rusting you can rent welding equipment from hardware stores or buy it if you prefer wear a welding mask thick gloves and a leather apron while you weld never touch metal right after you welded it wait for everything to cool down first cut a support beam for the center of the trailer bed use the same type of steel beams you used for the perimeter measure the width between the 2 longer sections of the perimeter then cut a piece of steel to that length fit it in between the length pieces to make sure it fits snuggly 5 x research source don t worry if it s a tight fit or if you have to press the piece in it should fit tight so it welds better weld the support beam at the halfway point of the trailer length measure the trailer lengthwise and find the halfway point mark this off with chalk then fit the support beam into this spot and weld it in place 6 x research source cut a 4 5 ft 1 4 m piece of metal for the tongue the tongue is the piece of metal that attaches to your car take the same type of steel you used for the perimeter and cut it to 4 5 ft 1 4 m 7 x research source 4 5 feet 1 4 m is a standard tongue size for an average trailer and towing vehicle a general rule of thumb is that the tongue should be 1 2 the length of the towing vehicle plus 1 foot 0 30 m to ensure it has clearance when you turn if your tongue is longer than 5 ft 1 5 m it needs extra reinforcing to stay stable make a notch in the tongue and rear support beam so they fit over each other these notches fit the tongue and support beam together measure the distance from the middle support beam to the outer beam at the back of the trailer then measure this same distance on the tongue and mark it cut out a section the same width as the support beam halfway up the tongue at this point then measure the support beam and find its midpoint cut a notch there the same width as the tongue halfway down the beam 8 x research source for this step a portable power saw is easier than a miter saw fit the two notches together take the tongue notch and slide it into the beam notch make sure the tongue rests level on the ground and reaches the middle support beam 9 x research source confirm that the tongue is in the center by measuring from the 2 back corners of the trailer bed to the tip of the tongue those 2 measurements should be equal which confirms that the tongue is centered weld the tongue to the trailer bed there are 2 points of connection between the tongue and the trailer bed first is the middle support beam where the end of the tongue reaches second is the notch on the back beam weld both locations so the tongue is attached 10 x research source attach the hitch connection to the end of the tongue complete the tongue with a hitch connection this is where the trailer attaches to your car get a hitch connector that fits into your car hitch then fit it onto the end of the tongue and weld it on 11 x research source hitch connectors are available from automotive stores make sure you get one that is the same width as the tongue some hitch connectors have holes for bolts in this case fit the connector onto the end of the tongue then drill through the bolt holes to make holes in the tongue screw the bolts in and then weld the end of the connector to the tongue construct a cage top the same size as the trailer perimeter out of metal pipe this cage top is the same size as the trailer bed except it only has 3 sides get metal pipes that are 1 inch 2 5 cm in diameter take 2 pieces of 6 ft 1 8 m pipe and 1 piece of 4 ft 1 2 m pipe place the 2 longer pipes on a flat surface parallel to each other lay the shorter pipe between them at one side making a 3 sided rectangle then weld the corners together 12 x research source standard metal tubing will work for this cage top if the pipes aren t the correct size when you buy them measure and cut the pipes to the correct size weld vertical metal pipes to each corner of the trailer bed these form the support beams for the cage top cut 4 pieces of metal tubing to 2 feet 0 61 m then weld each one to the corner of the bed 13 x research source the height depends on what you plan on hauling 2 feet 0 61 m covers most general needs if you ll be piling up a lot of material into the trailer then you might need a taller cage attach the cage top to the metal pipes once the cage top is complete lift it into position leave the open side on the opposite side from the trailer tongue rest it on top of the support beams and weld it into place 14 x research source having someone else help lift the cage top and hold it in place while you weld makes this part much easier build a trailer tailgate out of metal tubing use the same tubing you used for the cage cut 2 of them to be 4 ft 1 2 m and 2 to be 2 ft 0 61 m long lay the 2 longer pipes out parallel to each other then place 1 shorter pipe at each end to make a rectangle weld the corners together then weld metal mesh over the open section 15 x research source for an easier job you can also make the tailgate out of a single piece of metal this will be heavy however metal mesh is available at hardware stores or scrapyards fasten the tailgate to the trailer with door hinges take 2 normal door hinges measure 6 inches 15 cm in from each side on the bottom of the trailer and mark these 2 points weld a hinge on each point then weld the bottom of the tailgate to each hinge 16 x research source to close the tailgate you have several options for a simple solution wrap a chain around the gate and bar to keep it closed you could also attach connectors to the gate and trailer bed get 4 circular metal loops from the hardware store weld 2 onto the top corner of the cage facing backward weld the other 2 onto the outer top edge of the tailgate facing outward then close the gate so the loops line up and drop pins into them to keep it closed cover the bed and sides with metal mesh finally complete the trailer bed by covering it with metal mesh cut a sheet of mesh to the size of the base and roll it out attach it by welding down each point of the mesh that touches the trailer bed cut more sheets to fit each side of the bed as well then attach them with the same welding process 17 x research source some prefer to use plywood for the base of the trailer because it s cheaper and lighter if you won t be carrying heavy loads then lay plywood down for the trailer base get an axle kit from a hardware store for the wheels of your trailer use good quality axles kits are available from hardware stores that include the axle and tire attachments get a kit that fits the dimensions of your trailer 18 x research source some also use old car axles for a cheaper option if you prefer this option check around at scrap yards for extra parts remember that car axles and tires will be heavier than trailer parts place the axle 28 8 inches 73 cm from the back of the bed for single axle trailers building recommendations say to place 60 of the trailer length in front of the axle and 40 behind it this provides an ideal balance for a 6 ft 1 8 m trailer place the axle 28 8 inches 73 cm from the back of the bed 19 x research source for a trailer of a different length multiply its total length by 0 4 the result is the distance to place the axle from the rear of the trailer weld the axle clasps to the bottom of the trailer bed each side of the axle has 2 clasps that hold it in place press these clasps against the trailer beam and weld them down 20 x research source if the clasps won t stay in place clamp them down while you weld attach and fill the tires finally complete the trailer by attaching the tires slip the rubber onto the wheel then use an air compressor and fill the tires to their recommended pressure 21 x research source the recommendation for most trailer tires if 35 40 psi but check the specifications on your product if you aren t sure how to install and fill the tires properly let a professional do it so your trailer is safe,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to tow a trailer,borrowing your friend s boat for a weekend at the lake sounds like a great idea until you realize you ve got to drive it there whether you re hooking up a camper a vehicle or another variety of trailer to your car learning the specifications and the techniques for doing so will make your job a whole lot easier learn to hitch your trailer properly drive it correctly and back it up safely see step 1 for more information,make sure your vehicle is rated for towing the load 1 x research source you probably can t tow an 8 000 pound full size camper trailer with a honda civic depending upon the particular trailer you need to haul you need to check to determine the weight limits in the owner s manual and determine the appropriate hitch to have installed the weight should be generally specified by the manufacturer and listed in the owner s manual look online if you re missing the manual or check at an auto shop you need to find two numbers the gross trailer weight gtw which is the combined weight of the trailer and the gear on it and the maximum tongue weight for your vehicle to determine the class of hitch you ll need to tow the load get the appropriate class of hitch for your load installed generally you ll get a hitch receiver installed that you can use for different size trailer hitches for class 3 and up these receivers include a removable draw bar that you can use to install different sized hitches for different loads you might use 2 x research source if you get the largest receiver installed on your vehicle you ll be ready for any sized load your vehicle can handle classified according to the following specs 3 x research source class 1 2000 pounds gtw 200 pounds tongue weight class 2 3500 pounds gtw 350 pounds tongue weight class 3 5000 pounds gtw 500 pounds tongue weight class 4 7500 pounds gtw 750 pounds tongue weight class 5 10 000 pounds gtw 1000 pounds tongue weight get the right sized ball for the trailer the larger the ball the more weight it can carry basically the ball of the hitch will come in one of three sizes 4 x research source 1 7 8 inch 4 8 cm 2 inch 5 1 cm 2 5 16 inch 5 9 cm attach the trailer to the vehicle 5 x research source use the tongue jack to raise the trailer and align it with the ball make sure that the hitch lock is unlocked before lowering the trailer onto the ball and securing the tongue cross the safety chains to the hooks near the vehicle hitch or the vehicle frame making sure there is enough slack in the chains but not so much that they drag on the ground using the tongue jack try to raise the tongue off of the ball if you are able to do this the ball and tongue sizes do not match or the ball is not locked properly in this case replace the ball with the correct size or lock it properly and try again once the tongue of the trailer is on the ball you can lock it in place by placing a bolt or padlock through the ball lock mechanism to prevent it from accidentally opening attach the lights with the wiring harness generally these employ a simple color coded connection that makes it easy to hook up the lights to the harness should make it easy to install the connector properly to the tow vehicle s harness 6 x research source after you ve hooked up the lights do a quick brake check to make sure everything is functioning properly it s critical to make sure that your turn signals and brakes work on the back of the trailer to ensure a safe trip as well as no traffic tickets 7 x research source to keep the connection from corroding you might consider spraying the contacts with a small amount of dielectric grease check the tongue weight you want the amount of weight resting on the hitch to be roughly 10 to 12 percent of the total weight of the trailer 8 x research source you can use a regular bathroom scale to place under the beam to check if the weight out weighs your scale which is likely for 4000 lb and up trailers place the scale farther up the trailer to get a smaller measurement if you go a third of the way up triple the weight on the scale to get the approximate weight depending on the weight of the trailer you might consider using an equalizing bar to even out the pressure on the hitch these are generally long metal brackets that transfer a bit of the weight more toward your vehicle s front axle if you re hauling at the upper end of the specs use an equalizer secure your load 9 x research source depending on the load you re hauling you might need to use a tarp to secure loose objects in boats or refuse trailers since you re responsible for anything that flies out and causes damage you can also take this opportunity to make sure the hitch height is set correctly 10 x research source your trailer s tires are inflated to the appropriate specifications and that you haven t overloaded the trailer in such a way as to negate the careful checks you ve already performed 11 x research source get familiar with the clearance of your new rig before you hit the road get out your tape measure does the trailer make your rig considerably taller by how much how much length is added to the back of your car or truck these will be important considerations any time you re trying to park somewhere you normally wouldn t give a second thought to squeezing into if it s your first time towing a trailer 12 x research source it s best to practice some in a big empty parking lot before taking it out on the road you want to be as familiar as possible with the vehicle s response time and turning radius accelerate and brake slowly you must always compensate for the extra weight especially when slowing down and especially when driving on inclines play it safe and be cautious you also need to pay especially close attention to the added length of your rig anytime you re changing lanes merging exiting the interstate parking stopping for gas pulling over prepare for the difference in fuel economy towing a significant amount of weight will negatively affect your fuel economy so keep a close eye on the gauge making frequent pull offs in crowded gas stations can be stressful for first time towers so try to anticipate your fuel needs ahead of time to avoid difficult maneuvers stop frequently and check the connection even if you checked and doubled checked your connections and everything is up to code there s always the possibility that something in the road will jostle the trailer lose a bit it s best to stop sometimes especially on long or especially bumpy trips to make sure everything s still hooked up seeing your trailer careen off the road isn t the time to double check 13 x research source stay calm if you take a turn too narrowly 14 x research source it ll probably happen eventually that you ll mis time a turn or lack sufficient space to clear a turn like you figured you would don t panic make sure there isn t traffic behind you and back up slowly and as straight as possible to give yourself the clearance you need get a passenger to hop out and watch the trailer from a different angle to give you steering tips and use your mirrors judiciously get ready no lie backing up a trailer is one of the most difficult driving maneuvers there is but it s easy to master with the right technique and a bit of smarts to get ready roll down your windows and kick a passenger out to act as a spotter it might take a few runs before you get it perfect so it helps to have another set of eyes set yourself up for success by getting perpendicular to get yourself oriented properly pull more or less straight perpendicular to where you want the back end of the trailer to go keeping the truck and the trailer straight pull past the spot by 8 10 feet 2 4 3 0 m to give yourself adequate room to back up when you ve got it lined up turn your wheel opposite the direction of the parking spot so in other words if you ve pulled up perpendicular to a spot on your passenger side enough ahead of the spot to back up stop the car and jack the wheel to the left or the driver s side learn the s turn 15 x research source basically to get the back end of the trailer to go right you need to make your car back up going left and then straighten it back out to avoid a jackknife start backing up slowly and quickly straighten the wheel back out by turning it back toward the right watch your back end closely and straighten it back out if your angle gets too sharp this ll take some practice 16 x research source go extremely slowly if you re in an automatic transmission the idling speed should be plenty fast to make you nervous use gas only sparingly and don t make unnecessary or fast changes avoid jackknifing if at any point the angle of the truck to the trailer becomes smaller than a right angle straight it back out and give it another go don t try to force it because it won t work don t neglect your front end make friends with your side mirrors so you can keep an eye on where your front end is at all times taking special caution to watch out for parking obstacles and bumps that might mess up your approach and be a problem when you re trying to straighten back out drive like a pro and use your side mirrors your rear view will be basically useless in the task use the help of a spotter and your side mirrors to back up

motorcycle making sure you follow the rules of the road follow all of the safety precautions you ve learned prior as you complete the test once you pass the exam you can pay the registration fee for your licensing 4 x research source the on cycle exam will include identifying where the controls are for your bike as well as riding slowly in a circle and serpentine pattern make sure to practice these techniques on your own before you take the test 5 x research source during the test be aware of your surroundings and always travel below the speed limit depending on your location this can be done at the department of motor vehicles or with a certified third party tester in the united states you need to hold an instruction permit for 12 months if you are under 16 in order to get your license register your motorcycle visit your local department of motor vehicles in order to register your bike you will need to have the title for your motorcycle as well as make a required payment check online for any other specifics you need while registering your vehicle 6 x research source registration may differ in your area if you purchased it from a dealership or a private seller check your local regulations online ensure you have updated tags for your license plate if required in your area get insurance for your bike in order for you to legally drive in some areas you need to have insurance check with your local regulations to see if you need insurance if so talk to your current insurance provider to see if they have an option or bundle for motorcycles check your bike to make sure it is in working condition check your tire air pressure with a tire pressure gauge and fill them if they are low look at your brake fluid and oil levels to make sure they are filled correctly kneel on the ground to visually inspect your brake pads and chains to make sure they aren t worn down or rusted if anything looks wrong on your bike don t ride it 7 x research source test turning your lights and turn signals on and off to make sure none of the bulbs are burnt out purchase a helmet head injuries are the main cause of serious or fatal accidents for cyclists and helmets can greatly reduce the risk of harm find a full coverage helmet that has a visor that doesn t limit your vision so you can stay aware of your surroundings make sure the chinstrap fits tightly around your head so the helmet stays secure 8 x research source look for a department of transportation dot or european commission ece sticker or label to see if the helmet meets the legal requirements for safe riding do not wear helmets with tinted visors when visibility is low or while riding at night helmets usually have ventilation systems so your head will stay cool in hot weather not all locations require you to wear a helmet when you ride check with your local laws to find out get a snug jacket made of a sturdy material jackets made out of leather or a strong synthetic material will work the best for the most protection find jackets with lightweight body armor on your shoulders and elbows so you re less prone to injury if you get into an accident 9 x research source find a jacket that has reflectors built into the fabric so you are more visible to other vehicles if you cannot find a jacket with them sewn in use reflective tape on the front back and on the arms of your jacket wear long pants to protect your legs in case of a fall pants will protect the entire lengths of your legs more than shorts purchase a thicker material like denim for the best protection while riding your motorcycle 10 x research source wear leather chaps over your pants for an extra layer of protection pick out boots and gloves get boots with short heels so they don t get caught on any rough surfaces make sure the gloves cover all of your fingers and the boots come above your ankle find a non slip material that is durable such as leather that makes it easier to hold onto your bike in all weather conditions 11 x research source tuck the laces inside your boot so they don t hang or get caught on anything not only do gloves protect your hands while riding or during an accident they will also help prevent your skin from drying out locate the throttle on the right side grip of your motorcycle find the throttle on the right hand grip of your bike the throttle controls the speed of the motorcycle to accelerate and engage the engine twist the throttle toward you 12 x research source make sure the throttle snaps back into place if you turn it and let go if not have a mechanic take a look at it before you ride find the brakes above the right grip and near your right foot peg locate the brake for the front wheel by the handle right above the throttle you ll be using the front brake most frequently while sitting on the bike find the rear wheel brake with your right foot depress the lever to engage the brake 13 x research source most of your stopping power will come from braking your front tire if you don t see a lever near your right foot for a rear wheel brake consult the owner s manual for your motorcycle to learn where specific controls are found familiarize yourself with the clutch and shifter most motorcycles are manual transmissions and need to be shifted up or down as you accelerate and decelerate look for the clutch above the left handlebar it will look similar to the handle that controls your brakes find the shifter in front of your left foot and control it with the up and down lever 14 x research source keep your bike in neutral with your kickstand down when you aren t using it neutral is usually found in between the first and second gear many motorcycles work with a 1 down 5 up shift pattern from lowest to highest the gears usually go first neutral second third fourth fifth and sixth get on your bike approach your bike from the left side and hold onto the left handlebar for support swing your leg over the seat making sure not to hit your foot on the tail of the bike plant both of your feet flat on the ground and get comfortable in your seat once you have your feet planted you can raise the kickstand with the back of your foot 15 x research source ensure your kickstand is up before you start riding start your engine and let it run for about 1 minute turn the key in the ignition so that it s on and turn the red switch on your right handlebar to the on or run position ensure your bike is in neutral before starting the engine hold the clutch in before hitting the start button which is usually below the red switch and is marked with a lightning bolt let the engine turn over so that it is warmed up and properly running when you ride your bike 16 x research source always look on the gauge indicator on your motorcycle s dashboard to ensure that it s in neutral if not adjust the gear shift lever while holding the clutch to the neutral position holding the clutch in while starting your motorcycle prevents it the bike from moving forward if you aren t in neutral if you have a kick start bike the starting mechanism is found behind your right foot press down on it firmly to turn over the engine keep your headlights on and use turn signals locate the controls for your headlights and turn signals which are typically found on the left handlebar use them whenever you ride on populated roads so other drivers can see you 17 x research source if your bike doesn t have turn signals you ll need to use hand signals stick your left hand straight out so it s parallel to the ground palm facing down to indicate a left turn bend your left elbow so your forearm is at a 90 degree to your bicep which should be parallel to the ground and close your fist to indicate a right turn begin signaling 100 feet 30 m before you make the turn and return both hands to the handlebars when executing the turn 18 x research source shift into first gear and slowly ride your bike position your left foot so your heel is on the peg and your toes are near the lever hold the clutch down and shift to first gear by pushing the shifter down with your left foot your bike will start to move on its own without activating the throttle as you slowly release the clutch practice keeping your balance as it moves forward at a slow speed keep your hand on the brake in case you start losing control 19 x research source practice on an isolated section of road or in a parking lot that has little traffic so you don t have to worry about other motorists if you let go of the clutch too fast you may kill the engine if this happens shift back into neutral and start your engine again practice power walking by walking it forward while slowly releasing the clutch to accelerate work your way up until you re comfortable keeping your feet on the pegs while your bike is moving squeeze your clutch and shift gears with your left foot when you feel comfortable going faster turn the throttle slightly towards your body as you release the clutch to accelerate once you go over 5 mph 8 0 km h ease off of the throttle squeeze your clutch in and pull your shifter up past neutral into second gear once you ve shifted your motorcycle let go of the clutch and accelerate again 20 x research source as you increase your speed you need to shift into higher gears as you decrease speed downshift to a lower gear make sure to let off of your throttle when you squeeze your clutch as you shift once you switch into second gear you don t have to shift down to first gear until you come to a complete stop make turns by pushing the handlebar on the opposite side forward look in the direction you re turning rather than looking straight forward slow down as you approach your turn by releasing the throttle to make a left turn pull the left handlebar closer to you and push the right handlebar forward for a right turn pull the right handlebar close to you and push the left one forward 21 x research source for faster turns practice countersteering as you make your turn lean slightly in the direction you wish to go while pushing the handlebar away from you to stay balanced if you make too sharp of a turn it will cause you to crash practice slowing to a stop as you release the throttle slowly pull on the clutch and squeeze the front brake to slow down rest your foot on the rear brake and press down slightly to slow down once you come to stop plant your left foot on the ground and keep your right foot on the rear brake 22 x research source if you are finished riding shift your bike into neutral once you come to a stop don t squeeze hard on the front brake or else you could cause your tires to lock up and cause skidding or an accident move on to more populated roads once you feel more comfortable with the basics of riding and controlling your bike work onto roads

how to replace a hydraulic hose,many types of heavy equipment use a hydraulic system to work their mechanisms hydraulic hoses deteriorate over time and could start leaking and the equipment won t work properly until you replace worn out hoses start by locating the hose that is damaged then remove it by unscrewing it from the equipment finally find a matching replacement hose and install it to get the system going again,put on goggles and gloves to protect yourself from the hydraulic fluid hydraulic fluid is toxic and will damage any body part it contacts protect yourself with goggles and gloves while you re handling any hydraulic materials don t take them off until the job is done 1 x research source also consider wearing long sleeves and pants while changing the pipe to protect the rest of your skin if you re not working in a well ventilated area also wear a mask or respirator contact your local poison control center right away if any fluid gets on your skin in your eyes or in your mouth release all the pressure from the hydraulic system never work on a hydraulic machine while pressure is in the system this could result in hydraulic fluid spraying out and hurting you the process for releasing the pressure varies for different equipment consult your owner s manual for the exact procedure 2 x research source commonly hydraulic equipment has a lever that releases the pressure pull this lever first then shut off all the power to the hydraulic system finally work the hydraulic lever back and forth a few times to push excess pressure out if you re working on a piece of equipment that raises like a backhoe lower the mechanism completely to the ground before doing any work lay a sheet or bucket underneath the hose you re removing hydraulic fluid will leak out of the hose when you remove it prevent contamination of the area by collecting the fluid as it leaks a thick drop cloth or a bucket will stop the oil from spreading 3 x research source if the hose is in an awkward spot to put a sheet or bucket try stuffing rags underneath it instead remove any coverings that get in the way of the hose attachment some machines have hoods or coverings that protect the hoses especially at the attachment point if your equipment has any covering like this remove it so you can work on the hoses 4 x research source keep track of everything you remove from your equipment take a picture of the machine before you remove anything so you know how it should look when you replace the parts remember to consult your owner s manual for the exact process of hose removal different equipment may have a different process wash off the connectors on both sides of the hose dirt dust and grime have probably built up on both ends of the hose over time this can all get into the hydraulic system when you remove the hose and damage it before removing the hose spray around the hose attachments with window cleaner or a similar fluid then use a rag and wipe off any dirt 5 x research source use 2 wrenches to unscrew the fittings securing the hose hydraulic hoses are usually secured by an attachment with 2 fittings that spin in opposite directions hold the fitting closest to the hose with one wrench then use the other wrench to loosen the fitting closer to the machine by turning it counterclockwise spin until the hose detaches from the fitting then repeat this process for the other side of the hose 6 x research source the size of the wrenches depends on your hose type typical wrench sets come with a variety of sizes that should fit most equipment try out a few wrenches to see which fits your hose attachments get a new hose to the exact specifications of the old hose there are many types of hydraulic hoses so make sure you get the correct one by matching the new hose to the old one it should be the same width and thickness also check the pressure rating on the hose which is usually marked on the hose itself in psi 7 x research source if you don t know where to start bring the old hose with you to the store and ask an employee for the same type when you select a hose have the supplier cut and crimp the hose with an attachment crimping the hose requires special equipment and you can t do it at home when the supplier crimps the hose they will attach a new fitting to the end you can screw this fitting into the old fitting attached to your machine slide an abrasion sleeve over the hose if it rubs against anything if your hose is in a position where it rubs against the machine or other hoses consider getting an abrasion sleeve this is a piece of fabric that slides over the hose and protects it from damage if you ve had a problem with abrasions on your hoses in the past this could solve the issue and make your hoses last longer 8 x research source abrasion sleeves are available from hydraulic hose suppliers wipe off all of the hose fittings and connectors before installing it dirt or grime can get into the hydraulic system and damage it make sure all the connectors are clean before installing the hose use a damp rag and rub all the connectors to remove any dirt 9 x research source screw one side of the hose into the fitting inserting the first side of the hose is easy because one side is still free insert the end of the hose into the fitting and rotate it clockwise to tighten it when the hose stops spinning it s fully tightened 10 x research source don t over tighten the hose once the hose stops spinning it s snug enough pushing it further can rupture the attachment and cause leaks use 2 wrenches to screw in the final side installing the final side of the hose is a bit trickier because the hose can t rotate freely insert the hose into the connector then hold it in place with a wrench use a second wrench to rotate the connector attached to the machine stop rotating when the connector doesn t spin any further 11 x research source replace any coverings that you removed before the installation make sure all the pieces you removed are back where they belong before you test the hydraulic system refer to the pictures you took or the owner s manual to double check the correct positions test the system by circulating the hydraulic fluid at low pressure always test the machine after replacing its hoses start the machine and set the hydraulic mechanism to low power then check the hoses for leaks by running a piece of cardboard around it 12 x research source if you hear air escaping this also indicates a leak don t use the equipment for work if there is air leaking if your hose is leaking fluid or air stop the machine lower its mechanism and release the pressure double check where you connected the hose and see if the connector is tightened all the way if the connectors are tight and your machine is still leaking the hose may be defective remove it and bring it back to the supplier when you ve ensured there are no leaks raise and lower the hydraulic system slowly to check its performance if that all works properly your replacement was successful replace hydraulic hoses 5 years after the printed date of manufacture hydraulic hoses have a shelf life so manufacturers usually print the date of manufacture on the hose if you use the hose regularly replace it after 4 to 5 years of use even if it doesn t show signs of damage if you use the hose less it can last up to 10 years 13 x research source even if a hydraulic hose hasn t been used much replace it after 10 years rubber degrades over time and the hose could burst due to age inspect your hose for signs of wear or cracking stress heat sunlight and normal wear and tear all degrade hydraulic hoses check the surface of your hose units to see what sort of shape they re in if you see cracking or tearing replace this hose 14 x research source signs of wear include cracks tears and abrasions sometimes the outer rubber is worn away and you can see the support wires inside replace a hose that looks like this as soon as possible hoses might also be crushed or pinched these should be replaced as well rub cardboard over the hose to find an oil leak if your hose is leaking hydraulic fluid replace it right away if your machinery has multiple hoses locate the one with the leak first wipe the hoses down to remove any liquid or oil then take a piece of cardboard and rub it along the hose a wet spot should show up on the cardboard when you pass the leaking point this hose is the one to replace 15 x research source there is also a special dye designed to detect leaks in hydraulic pipes it glows when under a black light making leaks easy to spot this method is used in industrial equipment and factories if you want to try this method get a bottle of hydraulic dye and inject it into your hydraulic system then shine a black light around the hose to find the leak 16 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to build a bicycle cargo trailer,if you love using your bicycle to get around but find it difficult to carry everything you need with you you might want a cargo trailer to haul more stuff build a simple inexpensive cargo trailer to attach to your bicycle with a few pieces of lumber two bicycle wheels and some other easy to acquire parts make the trailer according to the dimensions you need for the size of load you want to carry use a bicycle trailer hitch and arm kit to attach the cargo trailer to your bike and start hauling away,sketch a plan of the trailer with measurements think about what you plan to carry and how big the trailer needs to be to carry it draw a sketch of the outline of the trailer and write down the length and width 1 x research source you will need to have a pair of matching bicycle wheels for the trailer already so you can use them to space the side pieces of the frame after you cut all the pieces to size for example if you have a bin of some kind that you want to be able to tow you can measure the bin and make the trailer at least large enough to hold it if you want to haul a plastic tub that is 24 in 61 cm by 18 in 46 cm big you could make the trailer about 26 in 66 cm long by 20 in 51 cm wide an example of dimensions you can use if you don t have a specific size in mind is 32 in 81 cm long by 22 in 56 cm wide this will give you a manageable trailer with plenty of room to haul stuff like groceries or tools cut 6 1 in 2 5 cm by 2 in 5 1 cm pieces of lumber for the frame use a power saw or hand saw to cut 2 1 in 2 5 cm by 2 in 5 1 cm pieces of lumber to the width you want the trailer to be for the front and back of the frame cut 4 more 1 in 2 5 cm by 2 in 5 1 cm pieces of lumber to the length you want the trailer to be for the sides of the frame minus 2 in 5 1 cm to account for the front and back pieces that will cap the side pieces 2 x research source if you don t have the tools to cut the lumber yourself get it pre cut for you at a home improvement center or lumber yard note that you need 4 long pieces for the sides of the frame because the wheels will fit between them lay out the frame on the ground or a large flat work surface position 2 of the side pieces along with the front and back pieces in a square or rectangle place the other 2 side pieces inside the outer frame parallel to the first 2 side pieces space the side pieces so that the bicycle wheels you have fit between them with the axles of the wheels above the wood 3 x research source use any 2 bicycle wheels of the same size for the trailer try to find used wheels rather than buying new ones you can check local thrift shops or used bicycle stores if you don t already have a pair of wheels attach the frame pieces together using 90 degree metal brackets and screws place a 90 degree metal bracket in each corner where 2 pieces of lumber meet on the inside of the frame use an electric drill to drive 0 5 0 75 in 1 3 1 9 cm wood screws through the holes in the brackets into the wood of the frame 4 x research source use metal brackets that have at least 4 screw holes in them for more stability this also applies to where the inner side pieces of the frame meet the front and back of the frame you will need 12 brackets in total 4 for the outer corners and 8 to hold the inner side pieces of the frame in place cover the frame with plywood cut a piece of 0 25 in 0 64 cm thick plywood to the size of the frame use a jigsaw or reciprocating saw to make cutouts on each side that are big enough for the wheels to fit through attach the plywood to the frame by driving 1 5 2 in 3 8 5 1 cm wood screws through the plywood into the pieces of lumber below it every 6 in 15 cm or so 5 x research source it s best not to use plywood any thicker than 0 25 in 0 64 cm or you will end up adding a lot of weight to the trailer the plywood creates a bed on the frame of the trailer that you can set things on to haul them you can use ropes or bungee cords to secure items or put some kind of bin on the trailer bed to hold things again if you don t have the tools to cut the plywood yourself just provide the measurements to the staff at a home improvement center or lumber yard and have them cut the trailer bed for you bend 4 electrical box plate covers to fit on top of the frame s side pieces place 1 in 2 5 cm of the short side of an electrical box plate cover into a vice hit the exposed metal with a rubber mallet until it is flat against the top of the vise so it s bent at a 90 degree angle repeat this for 3 more electrical box plate covers 6 x research source electrical box plate covers are thin flat pieces of metal that are normally used to cover electrical boxes they work well for this because they are easy to bend and work with you can purchase them at a home improvement center or online once the wheels are bolted to the plates the plates will be attached by screwing them to the plywood deck and into the innermost side pieces of the frame so the wheels are held in place and sticking up through the gaps in the plywood deck of the trailer drill axle holes 0 5 in 1 3 cm up from the bottom edge of each plate measure 0 5 in 1 3 cm up from the bottom edge then measure an even distance towards the center from each side and make a mark use an electric drill with a metal drill bit that is the same size as the wheels axles to drill a hole in each plate 7 x research source standard electrical box plate covers are at least 4 5 in 11 cm long so drilling the holes 0 5 in 1 3 cm up from the bottom will ensure that the axles have plenty of clearance between them and the wood of the frame drill screw holes in the metal plates to attach them to the frame use a metal drill bit the size of your wood screws to drill 2 holes in the bent part of each metal plate drill 2 holes offset from the 2 holes at the top in the side of each metal plate 8 x research source the exact positioning of the holes doesn t matter so don t worry about measuring them just make sure to offset the side holes enough from the top holes so the screws don t intersect in the wood bolt the metal plates onto the wheels slide a metal plate onto each side of the wheels axles using the holes you drilled for the axles secure the wheels in place on the metal plates by twisting the wheel nuts onto the ends of the axles 9 x research source if your wheels don t have nuts you can order some bicycle wheel nuts online or buy some at a bike shop screw the metal plate brackets into place on the side pieces of the frame position the brackets on top of the frame with the wheels sticking through the gaps in the plywood trailer bed drive 0 5 0 75 in 1 3 1 9 cm wood screws through the screw holes you drilled in the plates to attach them to the frame 10 x research source it s easiest to do this if you set the trailer on top of something to raise it up so the wheels clear the ground when you position them you can use something like cinder blocks or bricks to do this purchase a bicycle trailer arm and hitch browse bike shops or search online for kits that come with the two parts or look for a separate arm and hitch that are compatible buy the parts and take them home or order them online ad wait for them to arrive 11 x research source this can cost anywhere from about 30 100 usd if you purchase the parts online attach the trailer hitch to the rear left wheel hub of your bike remove the nut from the left side of the rear wheel hub on your bicycle slide the hitch onto the end of the wheel s axle where you just removed the wheel nut from then reattach the nut to hold everything in place 12 x research source this applies to side mounted trailer hitches that go on the rear wheel hub on the left side of the bike there are also some trailer hitch and arm kits that attach higher up to the rear seat post that you can try if you prefer screw the trailer arm onto the left side of the trailer position the arm on the left side of the trailer against the outer piece of the frame as far forward as the screw holes will let you put it attach it to the frame by driving the provided screws through the holes into the wood of the frame using an electric drill 13 x research source always refer to the manufacturer s instructions for any special mounting guidelines couple the arm and the hitch insert the end of trailer s arm into the hitch to connect them secure the arm in place in the hitch by sliding the pin through the hole in the hitch snap any straps in place or tighten any other connecting hardware 14 x research source the exact method for coupling the arm and hitch varies depending on the model and brand always refer to the manufacturer s instructions for specific directions about safely securing the trailer to the hitch,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to use a torque wrench,a torque wrench is a special tool designed to accurately tighten nuts and bolts to specific levels it is almost universally used to work on cars and bikes and it can only be used to tighten something torque wrenches are adjusted by hand so you don t need any other tools to operate one to use a torque wrench adjust the handle and set it to a specific level of torque use the tightener on the end of the handle to lock it in place then fit it over the socket nut or bolt and turn it clockwise to tighten it when you re done turn the settings on the handle back to 0 and store it somewhere safe get your torque wrench calibrated at least once a year to ensure that the hash marks remain accurate,loosen the tightener at the end of the wrench s handle look at the end of your wrench s handle to find the tightener that locks the settings in place it is usually a plastic or metal cap that is stuck into the end of your wrench often it is a different color than the rest of your wrench as well twist it counterclockwise by hand to loosen the piece so that you can change the wrench s settings 1 x research source you don t need to take it off of your wrench just loosen it until you don t feel a ton of resistance find and identify the torque measurements on your wrench inspect the area near your handle to find the hash marks for the torque setting there will be 1 set of larger numbers on the body of the wrench and 1 set of smaller numbers on the handle the smaller numbers are the smaller digits while the larger numbers are the larger units 2 x research source torque is measured in foot pounds or meter kilograms ft lb or m kg your torque wrench will list 2 sets of numbers on the wrench s hash marks the lower number is the measurement in foot pounds the larger number is the measurement in meter kilograms the vertical location of the edge of the handle determines the baseline while the rotation of the handle determines the smaller digits there is a center line on the wrench to show where the handle is set for example if the edge of the handle is on the hash mark for 100 and the smaller number on the handle itself is turned to 5 the torque setting for the wrench is 105 ft lb 1397 m kg turn the dial to raise or lower the torque setting on the wrench with the tightener loosened brace the body of the wrench with your nondominant hand turn the handle clockwise to raise it or counterclockwise to lower it once you reach the desired hash mark stop turning the handle 3 x research source if you need to reach a specific number raise the handle to the hash mark that is within 5 ft lb 200 m kg of your number so if you know you need to reach 140 ft lb 1860 m kg raise the handle to the hash mark between 135 145 ft lb 1795 1928 m kg some torque wrench handles are slide up and down instead of twisting into place twist the dial on the handle to make minor adjustments once you re close to the desired number turn your attention from the height of the handle to the dial itself follow the readings as you turn the handle slowly as you turn clockwise the number goes up as you turn counterclockwise the number goes down 4 x research source there are a few negative numbers after 0 so that you can move down a little as well on some wrenches the dial moves independently of the handle and you can twist it by turning the dial not the handle add the smaller digit on the handle to the number on the larger hash mark to determine total torque once you ve adjusted the handle s height and twisted the dial calculate your total torque to ensure that it s accurately adjusted by adding the numbers together take the hash mark on your handle and add the number marked on the dial to get your torque so if the dial reads 4 and the handle reads 50 your total torque is 54 ft lb 718 m kg 5 x research source you add the negative numbers as well for example if your hash mark is 120 and the dial is 2 you add 120 to 2 to get 118 ft lb 1569 m kg screw the tightener back into the end of the wrench by hand to lock it to lock a torque setting into the wrench flip it back over to the handle brace the wrench in your nondominant hand to keep it still twist the tightener clockwise by hand until it won t move any more this will lock the handle in place 6 x research source once you lock the tightener you cannot adjust your torque setting put your socket on the head of your wrench to use your torque wrench start by sliding a socket that matches your nut or bolt into the head of your torque wrench if you have an extender or adaptor that you re using you can slide that into the opening at the head instead 7 x research source torque wrenches come in different sizes but the sockets are almost always interchangeable torque wrenches are expensive so they rarely come in a single size turn the nut or bolt by hand until it catches the threading on the screw take the nut or bolt that you re going to tighten and place it over the threading for the screw or opening on your vehicle by hand turn the vehicle s nut or bolt clockwise with your fingers until the threading catches the threading on the screw turn the nut or bolt until it won t turn by hand anymore 8 x research source fit the socket on top of the nut or bolt that you re tightening with the nut or bolt set on the threading hold the handle of the torque wrench in your nondominant hand use your dominant hand to guide the socket adaptor or extender on to the nut or bolt slide the wrench over the nut or bolt until the 2 pieces are flush 9 x research source turn the handle clockwise to tighten the nut or bolt rotate the handle clockwise to begin tightening the nut or bolt almost all torque wrenches have automatic return functions so you don t need to reposition them on the nut or bolt for this type of wrench simply move it counterclockwise to reset it if you have a manual wrench reposition it on the nut or bolt to continue torquing it down 10 x research source if you hear a clicking or switching noise when you return the handle counterclockwise you have an automatically returning torque wrench stop turning the wrench when it starts clicking or stops moving if your automatic wrench clicks when you re returning it keep tightening the nut or bolt if it starts clicking when you turn it clockwise though stop tightening the nut or bolt the clicking noise while tightening indicates that you have reached your desired torque level on a manual wrench stop turning it when you feel the wrench resisting 11 x research source so if you have the handle adjusted to 100 ft lb 1330 m kg of torque the bolt is tightened to that level the moment it starts clicking when you try to tighten it manual wrenches will simply stop moving after the nut or bolt has been turned to the intended level of torque dial the wrench back to zero when you re done using it when you re done using the wrench turn both dial settings on the handle back to 0 leaving the dial turned to a torque setting higher than 0 can throw the calibration off over time 12 x research source turning the wrench to negative numbers is equally as bad for your wrench clean dirty or rusty nuts or bolts before loosening them one of the easiest ways to damage your wrench is to allow rust and grime buildup inside your sockets this makes it harder for your torque wrench to get an adequate grip on the socket and can cause a lot of problems over time clean each bolt or nut that you plan on tightening with a towel or rag before attaching your wrench 13 x research source torque wrenches aren t meant to be lubricated get any grease or lubricant off of your bolt or nut by using a degreaser before attaching a socket get your wrench calibrated at least once a year unless you have years of experience working on cars it s best to have a mechanic or torque wrench specialist calibrate your torque wrench for you when using your torque wrench a discrepancy will naturally develop between the measurements on your handle and the actual torque of the wrench fix this problem and prevent dangerous scenarios by getting your wrench calibrated once a year 14 x research source calibration usually costs between 25 75 usd,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to brake properly on a motorcycle,learning how to use your brakes is an important factor when you re riding a motorcycle when you re on a bike always apply the front and rear brakes to come to a controlled stop during a turn only apply the brakes at the start if you re going too fast as long as you practice using the brakes and stay aware of the road conditions you can ride your motorcycle safely,start braking at the proper time depending on your speed your average reaction time before you apply the brakes is around 0 62 seconds when you use your brakes it will take more time to come to a complete stop if you re going faster if you re going 30 mph 48 km h it will take approximately 2 39 seconds to stop but the distance you travel equals about 66 ft 20 m always apply your brakes to maintain a safe distance between you and any vehicles in front of you 1 x research source always stay aware of your surroundings and other traffic so you can brake when you need to if your bike has an anti lock braking system abs brakes then your stopping time and distance may be slightly shorter your braking distance can also be affected by road conditions slippery roads like those made from gravel or covered in rain will increase the distance it takes to stop ease off the throttle the throttle is located on the right handlebar and twists toward you to accelerate slowly turn the throttle toward the front of the bike when you want to decelerate or come to a stop when you disengage the throttle your bike will start to slow down naturally since you aren t giving the engine any gas 2 x research source if you keep your throttle twisted toward you while you brake it will cause stress on your transmission and brake pads press down on the rear brake with your right foot the rear brake lever is located in front of your right foot on your motorcycle when you want to reduce your speed use your toe to gently press the rear brake lever don t apply too much force or your rear tire will lock up and could cause you to lose control 3 x research source avoid only using your rear brakes since it can cause your bike to skid and increase your stopping distance squeeze the front brakes at the same time with 2 fingers to ease into the stop the front brake control is the handle directly above the throttle on the right handlebar of your motorcycle as you press down on the rear brake lever use your index and middle finger to slowly squeeze the front brake controls 4 x research source your front brake controls about 75 of your stopping power and will be the most effective when braking avoid squeezing the front brake with all 4 fingers since you might lock the tire and cause you to lose control hold the clutch to help slow down the clutch is the lever on the left handlebar on your motorcycle as you decelerate squeeze on your clutch this will help slow you down even more and allows you to shift into lower gears 6 x research source even though holding the clutch in will help you slow down it will not activate your brake lights make sure to always apply your brakes when slowing down so other drivers are aware shift into first gear before you get to your stop as you slow down use the shifter lever near your left foot to downshift to first gear putting your bike into its lowest gear helps you get a smooth start and stop while you re riding 7 x research source if you were already in first gear before slowing down you don t need to make any changes plant your left foot when your bike stops moving once your bike comes to a complete stop take your left foot and put it firmly on the ground this will help you keep your balance and prevents the bike from falling over when you want to start moving again begin slightly accelerating before putting your foot back in its place 8 x research source ease off of the throttle before you start your turn as you approach your turn slowly twist the throttle away from you to decelerate reduce your speed so you re still able to make your turn but not so you come to a complete stop 9 x research source if you re going too fast into your turn you may cross into a different lane or into oncoming traffic if you re going slow enough to make your turn and you don t need to use your brakes slightly press on the rear brake to flash your brake lights this lets other traffic know that you re going to slow down more apply the brakes before your turn if you need to slow down more easing off your throttle should be enough to slow you down during a turn but you might need your brakes if it s a tight corner gently press your right foot on the rear brake control and squeeze the front brake control with your right hand make sure the bike doesn t come to a complete stop unless you need to make one 10 x research source if you apply either of the brakes too hard you may lose traction and lose control lean into your turn squeeze your knees against your bike s body to help maintain your balance look toward your turn and press the handlebars in that direction as you make your turn lean toward that side of the bike to keep your balance your bike will start to lean into the turn so you can maintain control 11 x research source during a regular turn lean your body and the motorcycle at the same angle during slow tight turns keep your body as straight as you can and only lean the motorcycle to maintain your balance accelerate as you come out of the turn to stay balanced while you re in your turn maintain the same speed by holding onto the throttle at the end of the turn twist the throttle toward your body to speed up and keep your bike stable 12 x research source use both brakes when coming to a stop no matter the conditions when you re riding it s best to always use both of your brakes when you need to slow down or stop that way you don t have to change anything during an emergency situation apply both brakes evenly to come to a controlled stop in the shortest distance 13 x research source brake sooner than you normally would on slippery surfaces roads made of gravel or pavement that is wet can cause your bike to lose traction while it s stopping if you re on a road that isn t smooth stay aware of your surroundings and other traffic on the road apply your brakes early to avoid any collisions 14 x research source ride in another vehicle s tire tracks if you can to avoid slipping ease off the throttle when riding through standing water if you need to going fast through standing water on the road can cause you to aquaplane where you lose tire traction on the road if the road ahead of you looks shiny twist the throttle away from you and keep your bike as straight as possible to slow down 15 x research source do not apply the brakes if you lose control of your bike this way since it may make the problem even worse hold your brakes down if you re stopping on a slope if you come to a stop while you re riding either uphill or downhill your bike will start to roll down the slope when you stop keep your bike pointing as straight up the hill as possible to keep your balance plant your left foot on the ground and keep the front and rear brakes activated so your tires don t slip 16 x research source you can also try to plant both feet on the ground and only use your front brake but it may lose traction on steeper hills,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to trailer a motorcycle,a motorcycle tied down incorrectly to your trailer could result in your motorcycle shifting or tipping over during a trip down the highway or even falling out of your trailer to keep your motorcycle tied down safely on a trailer during road trips learn the correct procedures learn to pick an appropriate trailer secure your bike to it and drive safely,pick a trailer that suits your needs depending upon how often you plan to move your bike what kinds of conditions you expect to encounter how handy you are with tools and your budget there are a variety of different trailers that will be appropriate for your purposes 1 x research source a variety of trailers are made to fit certain models or brands of bikes check with your bike retailer for specific trailer suggestions for the model renting a trailer is usually the most common option since most companies that provide the equipment usually keep it very well maintained and in compliance with federal and state law in terms of registration plates and lighting size wise a 5 x 9 open trailer with a fold down ramp is ideal for one or two cruisers it s also good to have tie down rings in the front corners on the floor some trailers made specifically for motorcycle trailers have very small tires which bounce uncontrollably as you drive if the bike is worth towing use a heftier trailer get a corresponding ramp for the trailer measure the wheelbase and the ground clearance of the bike to make sure you get a ramp that s big enough for your purposes most trailers should come with a pull down ramp but if you re going to rent one or try to trailer a bike in your truck you ll want to be sure it ll work 2 x research source wheelbase is measured from the center of the front wheel to the center of the rear wheel of your bike ground clearance is measured from the lowest point of the motorcycle halfway between the front and rear wheels you also want to measure the height of the trailer or the truck bed in which you re trying to load the bike learn the trailer permit laws in your area laws vary from state to state so it s always a good idea to investigate any special permits laws rules of the road or licenses that you might need in order to stay in compliance with local law enforcement most rental companies will offer a temporary insurance policy which may cover only their equipment and which may require you to pay a deductible check with your insurance company to see whether the rental insurance will be sufficient just to be on the safe side make sure you have an appropriate vehicle with a hitch to pull a trailer with weight up to a ton you ll need something with rear wheel drive rated to tow two thousand pounds crown victorias or chevy caprices work great hitches are rated based on the tongue weight of different trailers and you ll need an appropriate hitch for the trailer you use for motorcycles class 1 or 2 hitches are usually fine 3 x research source smaller cars can work for smaller trailers but anything more than a ton needs a heftier vehicle trucks and suvs from ford rangers to chevy colorados are usually better than any car if you re going to tow a much bigger trailer in excess of two tons you ll need at least a half ton truck like an f 150 or a silverado a half ton truck like a ford f 150 or chevy silverado 4 x research source get some ratchet straps 5 x research source there are several varieties of these straps but the ratchet type is easier to compress the suspension than the pull strap type and they are available at most home centers and discount stores pay attention to the working load limit of the straps you get and choose a strap that has a working load limit of at least half the weight of your motorcycle for instance if your bike weighs 650 pounds find a strap with a working load limit of at least 325 pounds each most one inch nylon straps will have this rating get a wheel chock for the front of the trailer a wheel chock is a sturdy material made of metal or hard plastic that is placed around the front wheel of the motorcycle to inhibit it from moving while the wheel chock is not a requirement to trailer your bike it certainly makes the chore much easier especially if you are loading and strapping without the assistance of a friend if you do not have a chock then park the bike at the very front of the trailer if there is a rail on the trailer your front tire should be pressed against the rail use the ramp to load the bike push the bike up the ramp into the bed of the trailer placing the front wheel into the wheel chock place the front wheel of your motorcycle into the wheel chock put the side stand down and attach the straps 6 x research source a general rule for strapping anything is to attach the straps as high as possible on the bike and as low as possible on the trailer for the greatest holding power use an x pattern for maximum stability start with the front left strap as viewed from a sitting position on the bike secure one end of the strap to the trailer and the other to a rigid point on the frame or triple tree tighten the front left strap until it is taut next attach the front right strap in the same manner as the front left strap since your bike is on the side stand it will be leaning to the left but in the end we want the bike to be perfectly vertical when secured you may want to use some soft loops on the motorcycle end of the strap to protect the bike then attach the ratchet strap to the soft loop secure the straps to the trailer and ratchet them down secure the other hook end of the strap to a secure spot in your truck or trailer preferably on an angle pull the slack out of the strap and ratchet it a few times repeat this same process for the right side tighten each ratchet strap so that the bike will sit in the upright position on its own you will notice the bike start moving into a vertical position and your front suspension compressing once the bike is vertical you will want to tighten the left and right sides equally until the suspension is completely compressed don t strap the handlebars most manufacturers say that it s not safe to attach ratchet straps to the handlebars because they are simply not designed to take the pressures that will be exerted by the straps and a bouncy road strap the rear of the bike remember to secure the straps rearward of the motorcycle so that the rear straps put counter tension on the front straps making your bike an immovable fixture on the trailer do not tie the straps to guards on saddle bags or trunks as it is likely you will pull the guards off during transit again you will want to compress the suspension as you ratchet the straps make sure the suspension is compressed as you ratchet the straps down you need to make sure the suspension is compressed fully if it is not compressed it is possible that your straps can come loose as the bike rebounds bouncing around from bumps and dips in the road practice driving around with the trailer attached to your main transport vehicle you don t want the first time you drive with a trailer to be the first time you ve got your prized bike strapped to it driving at highway speeds in the elements practice hooking up your trailer and driving around a bit to get a feel for things 7 x research source practice tight corners driveways and backing up specifically take it for a test run on a highway at high speed get a sense of how you will need to adjust your regular driving habits to accommodate driving with the trailer attached cover the bike with a tarp after securing the bike to the trailer use a canvas or vinyl tarp to cover it and keep it safe from the elements or the cover you use for your motorcycle when you park it the tarp doesn t need to be doing any load bearing work so just tie it firmly down to the straps or to the bike recheck the straps regularly it s important to go back and check all the straps and make sure they are not rubbing any parts on your bike also recheck the tension on the straps on a longer trip do a walk around every time you stop and re check the straps again it s always best to be on the safe side,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to grease trailer bearings,wheel bearings whether they re on an rv or a trailer of some sort are essential in helping the wheels spin easily and freely they need to be lubricated regularly so that they operate at their best capacity greasing or repacking trailer bearings is an important part of trailer maintenance and thankfully it doesn t take long to do remove the wheel and take apart the hub until you can access the bearings from there you ll clean them and repack them with new grease reassemble the hub and replace the wheel before moving on to the next one,lift the trailer with a car jack so you can safely access the wheels chock the wheels first by setting heavy wedge shaped blocks in front of each one to keep the trailer from rolling while you re working on it place a jack stand on either side of the wheel and crank them up until the wheel is no longer touching the ground 1 x research source for this project you should not need to ever be underneath of the trailer itself loosen the lug nuts and remove the wheel from the trailer use a wrench or a tire iron to remove the lug nuts and set them off to the side somewhere safe pull the wheel off of the rod toward your body and put it off to the side too 2 x research source if the lug nuts are rusted and hard to remove spray them with a thread loosener let them sit for 2 3 minutes and then try again to remove them if the tire is stuck on the rod bang a mallet along the edge where the rim and tire come together until the tire comes loose loosen and remove the dust cap with a screwdriver the dust cap just pops into place so you don t need to worry about unscrewing it wriggle the tip of a screwdriver between the hub and the lip of the dust cap and work it around the edge until the cap pops loose 3 x research source to get to the bearings there are about 7 pieces that need to be removed some of these you may be able to remove by hand but others you ll need to use screwdrivers hammers pliers or wrenches take out the cotter pin and remove the spindle nut with the dust cap out of the way you will see the spindle nut and the cotter pin which looks similar to a bobby pin the cotter pin will be bent at an angle so take a pair of needle nose pliers straighten out the pin and pull it out take out the spindle nut with your fingers or use a screwdriver to pop it out 4 x research source the spindle nut is also sometimes called a castle nut if the cotter pin is rusty or seems fragile replace it loosen the nut and washer and remove the hub from the spindle not all models of trailers have the nut and washer so don t panic if you don t see them once the nut and washer are off you should be able to just jiggle the hub off with your hands set everything off to the side on clean rags or newspaper 5 x research source the trailer bearings are inside of the hub and depending on their state may come loose on their own at this point remove the inner bearing and grease seal from the hub use a wooden dowel and a hammer to tap the bearing and grease seal out from the front of the hub the front is the side where you can see the threads of the screws the back is the side where you can see the tops of the screws set the bearing and grease seal to the side 6 x research source if the bearing isn t too dry you may be able to push it out by hand or use a screwdriver to pry it out if the seal is rusty use something like wd 40 to loosen it up soak the bearings and spindle nut in kerosene use a small pan and fill the bottom with 2 to 3 inches 5 1 to 7 6 cm of kerosene set the greasy bearings and spindle nut into the kerosene and let them soak for about 10 minutes 7 x research source if you notice any damage in the bearings like scratches pitting or discoloration you ll need to buy replacements if you don t want to use kerosene you could also use acetone or mineral spirits clean the inner and outer races while the bearings are soaking wipe away any visible grease with a clean rag and visually examine them out to see if they are damaged at all if you need to dip an edge of a rag into kerosene and use it to clean off any stubborn grease 8 x research source damage to a race might look like pits dents or scratches just like there are inner and outer bearings there are also inner and outer races thankfully they are the same shapes and sizes so you don t need to worry about getting them mixed up replace the grease seal every time you grease the trailer bearings even if the grease seal still appears to be in good condition it s recommended that it be replaced every time you perform maintenance on the trailer bearings keep in mind that you ll need 4 8 grease seals just depending on how many wheels your rv or trailer has 9 x research source you can buy new grease seals online or at your local auto parts or trailer supply store wipe down the clean bearings and spindle nut with brake cleaner take the bearings and spindle nut out of the kerosene and set them on a clean rag or newspaper spray them with brake cleaner and either dry them off with another clean rag or let them air dry 10 x research source this step just helps get the bearings and spindle nut extra clean if you feel satisfied with how the bearings look after soaking in the kerosene you can skip this step you can buy break cleaner online or at an auto parts store repack the bearings with new grease if you don t want to get grease all over your hands wear a pair of rubber gloves during this process because it can get messy scoop up about 1 tablespoon 15 grams of grease with your fingers and manually push it into the bearings rotate the rollers as you go making sure all of them are thoroughly covered coat the inside of the bearings too 11 x research source lucas oil 10320 multipurpose marine grease sta lube sl3121 wheel bearing grease and star brite wheel bearing grease are 3 of the top rated bearing greases even if your trailer doesn t go near water you can still use marine grease it actually is more durable and heat resistant than many other products replace the bearings hub spindle nut cotter pin and dust cap use the wooden dowel and hammer to tap the bearings back into place in the hub then reassemble the rest of the parts until the dust cap is popped back into place tap it with the hammer as well to make sure it is in there as securely as possible 12 x research source if your model of trailer also had a nut and washer don t forget to replace those between the outer bearing and the spindle nut put the tire and lug nuts back into place settle the wheel back onto the rod and screw the lug nuts back on with a wrench or tire iron once it is secured you can lower the car jacks and move on to the next tire 13 x research source in all this project may take you 1 3 hours just depending on how easy it is to take apart all the pieces and how many tires you need to do,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to countersteer motorcycle,the basic mechanics of countersteering are performed by every kid who s ever ridden a bicycle you re already doing it if you re riding a motorcycle at higher motorcycle speeds however it s important to have a basic understanding of the process of leaning into a turn increasing the acuity of the intended turn countersteering doesn t mean turning your handlebars away from a turn rather you re pushing on the handlebar to initiate a lean this push on the handlebar will have your wheel heading very briefly in the wrong direction and then as a result of the lean of the wheel your bike immediately recovers and heads the direction you want to go by understanding what countersteering is and how it works any rider can make more controlled turns at higher speeds steer away from hazards and ride with less fatigue,keep your arms relaxed and parallel to the ground you don t want to be pulling down on the handle bars if you do that you ll essentially be fighting against the bike if the road is bumpy or has potholes then your handlebars are bound to jerk around a little bit allow for these small movements 1 x research source anchor yourself to the bike using your knees since you won t be gripping onto the handlebars with your arms really tightly it s important to anchor yourself by hugging the motorcycle with your knees it doesn t need to be a death grip just enough to keep you sturdy you can also hold down on the pegs with the heels of your boot plan your turn if you have to decelerate downshift or worst of all brake in the turn then you have entered the turn too quickly brake before the turn consider your entering strategy and then enter it smoothly you may want to enter the turn differently depending on the camber of the road and the type of turn but generally use the delayed apex strategy this means entering the turn on the outside and then scooting back to the inside as you clear the apex of the turn 2 x research source push the handlebars on the direction you want to turn if you want to turn right push the handlebars on the right side if you want to turn left push the handlebars on the left side while this may seem incorrect turning the bars in the opposite direction from the turn forces the bike to tilt slightly while maintaining the proper speed allows it to stay upright 3 x research source memorize this countersteering mantra turn right push right turn left push left use the delayed apex strategy as you approach your turn signal at least 100 feet 37 meters before the turn and check your mirrors for signs of traffic move to the outside third of your lane the corner opposite the direction of your turn don t go so far that you re putting yourself in danger of oncoming traffic just chose the outer third so that you can enter the turn with enough room to swing back to the inside slow your bike before turns turning on a motorcycle is dependent on the speed you are traveling so it s important to brake on your approach to the turn then hold steady on the throttle during the turn downshift before the turn if necessary but never in it you can shift into a higher gear during the turn if you want to but don t do this until you get more comfortable the balance of the motorcycle is gyroscopic which means that speed keeps it up depending on the grade of the turn you re making and the speed at which you re traveling you ll probably need to slow down some never under any circumstances should you slow in the middle of a turn or brake in the middle of a turn unless there s some emergency even then it s safer to evade than to attempt to stop if you absolutely must stop then level your handlebars out before you start to brake square your handlebars and then apply progressive pressure to both brakes at the same time 70 of your stopping power comes from your front brake but don t grab it especially in a turn apply progressive pressure 4 x research source push the handlebar to the direction of the turn this means that if you are turning right you ll want to push the handlebar to the right this is different than turning in close quarters you are essentially keeping your handlebars square but initiating a lean gently increase pressure from your palm on the handlebar pushing it gently logically it may seem as if you were trying to turn the bike in the opposite direction you want to turn however as you do this lean gently into the turn while shifting your weight slightly in the direction you want the bike to tilt 5 x research source again while that may seem counterintuitive at first this is the principle of counter steering turning the front wheel slightly to drop the bike into a gentle lean which allows for greater stability during a turn the sharper you want to make the turn the greater your lean angle should be keep your head up maintain pressure on the handlebars and look through the turn to the road ahead of you avoid looking at the side of the road or other distractions as target fixation can cause you to go directly toward it look at the path in the road you want to be on maintain a steady throttle don t decelerate during the turn or let off the throttle you don t have to speed up in the turn just keep the throttle steady if you need to let off it at all that means you entered the turn too fast try to have confidence in your bike just because it is leaning doesn t mean it s about to fall over as long as you keep pressure on the throttle you should keep friction with the road by holding down the throttle you re pushing that back wheel into the road and keeping the bike steady look through the turn don t look at the ground if your vision is wrong you ll end up crashing if you look at the ground you ll go to the ground keep your eyes where you want to be going that s not directly ahead of you that s at the exit point of the turn vision is incredibly important while countersteering 6 x research source accelerate out of the turn when you are exiting the turn release some pressure on the inner handlebar and add some more pressure on your throttle now push slightly on your outer handlebar and your bike will come back upright this doesn t need to be a dramatic push back to the outside just a slight nudge as you release pressure on the inside handlebar apply your front brake before the grade to stay stable in turns at high speed it s common to apply only your front brake during the downshift this should occur on the outside of the lane opposite the direction you want to turn and in the straight just before the grade begins you should immediately transition from slowing into accelerating into the turn 7 x research source higher torque engines have a tendency to spin out in the back tires so depending on what kind of motor you ve got you may want to downshift more accordingly listen to your bike and get a feel for its capabilities at speed before you try to push it this section assumes racing road conditions and dry asphalt lean and countersteer away from the turn as you approach the grade countersteer away from the turn and lean toward it at no more than 45 degrees on the angle you shouldn t have to throw much weight but you might need to adjust your body position slightly to maintain stability at higher speeds adjust your body position more aggressive turns such as those done by competitors on sports bikes may require riders to adjust their body positions such that the torso is parallel to the bike on the right side and dropped low beside the fuel tank 8 x research source position your head correctly the helmet should be in a position near the right handlebar and the right leg cocked outward on the peg at about 45 degrees with the ball of the foot on the peg and the heel up against the bike accelerate into the turn as soon as you secure yourself in your lean accelerate the motorcycle through the apex of the turn keep your lean angle as stable as possible and accelerate the bike up slowly throughout the turn 9 x research source the gear you use will depend on many things the style of the bike the road conditions the grade and the speed that you re traveling there s no one gear for turning fast maintain a stable lean throughout the apex of the turn dragging your knee if necessary the right knee may drag on the ground if properly equipped and the lean angle is aggressive enough in competitive racing right yourself by countersteering toward the turn as they exit the grade racers will right themselves by countersteering back the other direction into the direction of the turn which was just completed this should allow you to pop up into a stable upright position and throttle up shift your body back to a centered and low position on the bike for stability throttle up most of the time you ll need to shift up immediately after a turn to continue accelerating at high speed having drifted toward the outside edge of the track again,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to unwobble a bicycle rim,the best way to make sure a bicycle rim stops wobbling is through using a method called truing the wheel the spokes on your bike all work together to keep the rim straight each one pulling in a slightly different direction at the same force in order to keep the wheel straight because there are so many spokes to account for this makes truing a tricky art form but if you re patient and go slowly it is still very doable for any burgeoning bike mechanic,flip the bike upside down or put the wobbly wheel in a truing stand if you have one you need to be able to spin the wheel freely allowing you to see where it wobbles and make subtle changes usually turning the bike upside down is more than enough but precise mechanics can use a truing stand which holds the wheel in place and has small calipers that let you notice even the smallest wobble if you ve got a serious wobble or issue it can help to take the tire off first at the very least take some air out of the tires if not one will likely pop while you work 1 x research source locate the bend in the rim by noting where the wheel comes nearer to the brakes spin the wheel watching near the brakes to see where the wheel swings to either side either stop the bike at this point with your fingers noting where it is or use a permanent marker to measure the wobble simply hold the marker evenly at one height and spin the wheel so that any wobbling hits the marker and makes a streak looking to protect your beautiful wheels from marks take a small piece of masking tape and use it to make the spots where there is some wobble understand how spokes are tightened and turned the way you tighten spokes seems a little counter intuitive at first since you ll be turning spokes on both the top and bottom of the wheel it seems like it s breaking the righty tighty rule you ve grown up with but there is an easier way to think about it imagine you re looking straight down at the top of the spoke where it meets the rim if you were to take a screwdriver and stick it into the top of the spoke you would turn the spoke clockwise like normal to tighten it and counter clockwise to loosen it if you re ever in doubt imagine which direction you would turn this screwdriver and turn accordingly grip the spokes around your problem area and squeeze lightly checking for looseness if you re not sure what loose is feel your other wheel or the spokes on other sides of the wheel while not all wobbly wheels have noticeably loose spokes most do which will point out the exact spoke where there is an issue if a spoke is extremely loose tighten it until it is about the same tension as those around it if a spoke is extremely loose you should still go ahead and try to fix it that said you may need a new rim if this happens regularly it should be a rare occurrence 2 x research source there are rare cases where a spoke feels too tense which can cause a wobble as well the technique to fix it shown below is the exact same just with loosening instead of tightening note which side each spoke pulls towards to find the ones causing your wobble the spokes will alternate which side of the rim they go to half to the left half to the right the balance between these two sides is what keeps your wheel true and prevents wobble so if your wheel wobbles to the left that means the spokes on the right side are too loose to keep things balanced or the spokes on the left are too tight this is why you only get wobbles in certain areas one spoke that is too loose only affects the wheel in the precise spot trace the spoke down from the rim down to the center of the wheel to see which side it pulls towards 3 x research source tighten the spoke just below your problem area with a half turn of the nipple the golden rule of rim truing is go slow using your spoke wrench a small tool with notches made to fit perfectly around the nipple the small sheath where the spoke meets the rim tighten it with a half turn clockwise then check again remember go slowly this first turn won t fix the issue immediately but don t keep turning just yet don t have a spoke wrench a pair of needle nose pliers will work in a pinch but you should buy a spoke wrench cheaply as soon as you can remember to get the right side if the wobble is to the left you need to tighten the spoke that pulls the rim back to the right 4 x research source loosen the two spokes next to the one you just tightened using only quarter turns this is how you keep the radial tension up and down the rim keeping it perfectly round even without too much work say you just tightened a spoke on the right side of the rim because it wobbled to the left on either side of this spoke are two more spokes for the left side of the rim instead of continuing to crank on the right side which can put too much pressure on one spoke just loosen the spokes that pull it to the left by using just a quarter turn on each spoke you undo the same amount of tension on the left that you just added to the right further balancing your wheel keep this simple math equation in your head as you work if i tighten one spoke i need to loosen the two spokes next to it half as much to make sure it stays balanced the opposite equation loosening one spoke and then tightening the other two half as much also applies spin the wheel and check the truing after every set of adjustments spin the wheel and check your work you should be keeping an eye on the wheel frequently don t just blindly tighten the spokes without seeing if you re making any progress continue this 3 spoke adjustment process until the wobble is gone you may need to take another set of three spokes and do the same thing just remember to keep the forces even balancing out every adjustment on both sides never turn more than a half turn at a time and only work on one set of spokes at a time allowing you to quickly undo something if you make a mistake you will likely get smaller and smaller adjustments as you work using only turning the nipple by small increments at this point you should be spinning the wheel after every tightening making only the smallest adjustments until you hit perfection 5 x research source check for flat spot wobbles or a bike that is not radially true the most common issue is when the rim wobbles left to right but bike tires can also wobble up and down as well forming egg shaped wheels or small flat spots where the tension isn t quite right up and down after fixing the rim from side to side make sure you didn t accidentally pull the wheel out of radial true as well usually you ll have a few simple adjustments to make but they should be easy 6 x research source check that the bike is laterally trued first as best as you can get it you ll always want to finish laterally truing the bike before attacking a radial wobble radial wobbling is when the bicycle rim loses its perfectly round shape and you can usually feel a little bump when riding this has more to do with the overall tension on the bike and is easier to fix once you ve got side to side areas ironed out spin the rim and watch it from the side noting any high spots using calipers or your fingers spin the bike and place your finger a marker or a set of calipers underneath the wheel just below where it would touch the tire then spin the wheel and note where it rubs against the caliper this is where the rim has elongated and you ll need to pull it in to get this bump out of the rim 7 x research source tighten the two spokes that are on either side of the rubbing area with a half turn one of these spokes will go to the right side of the bike the other to the left so tightening them both equally will pull the high spot in without ruing your radial truing move the calipers pen or your finger closer in spin the wheel and adjust as needed keep working these two spokes until you ve pulled the rub out of the rim using smaller and smaller are turns like a quarter turn to get more precise truing after every set of turns spin the wheel and double check the lateral truing again making sure you ve not introduced a new wobble 8 x research source check that parts of the wheel don t dive inwards now making flat spots and loosen as necessary this often happens on the opposite side of the wheel as the part you re working on but it is an easy fix just find the two spokes on either side of your low spot and loosen them with quarter turns until you re even again 9 x research source know when a rim is damaged and not simply out of true if your wheel can t stay in true shows noticeable bending or denting or your spokes won t stay tight you ll need a new wheel oftentimes you ll need to true a wheel after a crash which can loosen spokes but it is not always possible if you find yourself working and working without results the rim is likely shot 10 x research source tighten any extra loose spokes until they feel as tense as the rest then make the finer adjustments the half turn two quarter turn system won t work if the spoke is noticeably looser than the rest simply tighten this spoke on its own until it feels about as tight as the spokes around it then move on to the more precise adjustments make sure the wheel is seated perfectly and the brakes are even if you can t seem to true the bike is the rim really out of true or do you not have the wheel in the frame properly the best way to ensure this is to release the wheel as if you were about to take it off the bike then squeeze the brakes to hold the bike in the center of the frame re tighten the wheel into the frame and then let go of the brakes leaving the wheel in the dead center replace any broken spokes as soon as you can as one broken spoke often leads to more when you lose a spoke you can keep riding for a bit if you have not other option to get home but the increased pressure on the other spokes will warp and bend your wheel if left for too long eventually causing more spokes to break and potentially ruining your rim permanently 11 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to get a motorcycle license,there s no better way to experience the open road than on a motorcycle and you ll save on fuel too to legally operate a motorcycle you ll typically need either a

need to include costs on how much the property will cost how much you will need to run the day to day operations costs of gas contracts and franchise fees etc write a mission statement and goals for your gas station business research what types of insurance and permits you will need to operate a gas station this can vary by country state and county you may need a permit if you wish to sell tobacco and alcohol most gas station owners are liable for any gas and spills from underground storage tanks under epa or other equivalent regulations most gas station owners have insurance for these purposes you may be required to have liability for customer injury many insurance policies are available to business to cover these instances you will need to make sure you are not personally financially liable for damages you may need to consult an attorney to draw up legal contracts think about whether or not you will be part of a franchise agreement if you want to open up a sunoco or bp station for example you would be part of a franchise 2 x trustworthy source u s small business administration u s government agency focused on supporting small businesses go to source a franchise agreement allows a franchisee you as a business owner to use the trademark products and business models of a larger company for example if you entered into a franchise agreement with sunoco you would essentially own a sunoco station franchisees have to pay royalties to the parent company this is usually a percentage of sales or a monthly fee most gas stations are part of a franchise agreement before you decide to franchise or sign a specific franchise agreement you will need to do your research talk to other business owners who have a franchise agreement with the chain you want to open know what you are getting into look at a franchise contract to know what your rights and responsibilities are watch out for specifics in your contract most franchise agreements benefit the company more than the business owner talk to an attorney or other suitable legal professional to make sure of the legalities of any franchise agreement make a budget for your new business you will need to include funds for start up as well as operation your budget plan should definitely include real estate costs purchasing the land and building costs or the cost of purchasing an existing gas station an estimation of legal costs such as attorneys fees for drawing up business contracts and consultations will need to be included in your budget insurance and permits will be costly and you should include this in your budget estimate you will need funds for set up of your gas station include an estimation of costs for promotions advertising and signage make sure you have an estimate of costs of start up inventory and cash you will need to have on hand build the costs of gasoline supply and convenience store inventory into your budget you will need to do research into gas suppliers and store warehouses to see where you can get a cost efficient contract finally include an estimation of salaries and employee costs as well as day to day expenses such as gasoline and utilities you will need to do research in the industry for standard employee salaries as well as costs of gasoline research different companies and obtain a gas supplier contract you will need someone to supply the gas for your station 3 x research source different suppliers may offer you different contracts basically a supplier contract stipulates that the supplier will earn a cut of your gas sales typical profit on gas sales for many gas station owners is 8 13 cents per gallon this varies around the globe don t immediately sign a fuel contract with a local supplier unless you are required to contract with a specific company by your franchise agreement it is best to shop around for companies which will offer you the most profit on your gas you should have an attorney look over your contract with your fuel supplier to make sure all the agreements are mutually beneficial and will not involve you in a legal loophole think about open land available in your region can you think of an area in need of a gas station 4 x research source market analysis has shown that one of the top things a consumer thinks about in choosing a gas station is location customers will want a location that is along a major route to work and convenient in terms of traffic patterns think about the set up of your station as well customers will want to go to a station that is easy to enter and exit from nearby roadways consider the local competition you will want to avoid an area that is already saturated with gas stations 5 x research source look into areas where there is a lot of growth such as around major cities as new neighborhoods and business districts crop up there will be a demand for new gas stations research the locations of big box retailers such as sam s club which offer steep gas discounts you will want to place your gas station a distance away from these places to avoid the competition consider hiring a modeler to work with you many companies exist for site modeling these professionals will help you build a digital model of your gas station at the site you are planning this can help you decide whether or not your design is feasible at the location and if there is too much competition nearby think about the accessibility of a potential gas station to local roads and interstates your presence along a key interstate or street will draw in customers 6 x research source if your site is close to an interstate or major highway exit consider investing in advertising signage along that route to increase your business take into consideration the flow of traffic during different times of the day you will want your gas station to be on the same side of the road as heavy traffic during peak times research current and future construction projects in the area you will want to avoid opening a new business along a route affected by long term construction customers will try to avoid highways and roads with heavy construction if there is a plan for long term construction at or near your location consider purchasing a different lot even short term construction projects can impede your business remember your goal is to get lots of customer traffic near your gas station consider local and state regulations about the building and location of gas stations there may be local restrictions or fees associated with opening this type of business 7 x research source check the history of the site you are considering if you are purchasing an existing gas station be aware of any spills or leaks that occurred in the past you could be held liable by local or state laws for any future complications if you are purchasing an existing station check if you are held to the gas supplier contract for that site some places have laws that will bind you to an existing agreement get together documentation to obtain a gas station loan or appropriate loan available where you live you will need to collect the following types of documents in some countries 8 x research source a copy of your

how to start a motorcycle,so you want to start a motorcycle if the machine is in good condition this should not be difficult read on for a basic tutorial on how to start a motorcycle,determine whether you have a carburetor based or fuel injected motorcycle many motorcycles especially older or less expensive models do not have modern fuel injection systems if you aren t sure you can tell by looking for a choke control it is normally located on the left handlebar above the horn carbureted motorcycles have a choke but fuel injected bikes do not 1 x research source sit on your motorcycle seat when starting it this will put you in full control of anything that happens once it s started if you are starting the motorcycle unmounted for some reason make sure that you shift your bike into neutral located between 1st and 2nd gear before you fire the engine you don t want the bike to take off without you make sure that the motorcycle is in working condition you should have plenty of gas and a well charged battery it is important to keep the motorcycle properly serviced particularly in damp or cold conditions fit new spark plugs or if not worn clean and gap the old ones check the ignition timing and adjust if necessary if fitted have the ignition points replaced a carburetor service and clean is also a great idea replace the spark plug leads if they look old worn or frayed use only manufacturer recommended spark plugs and plug leads look for the reference in your motorcycle s handbook check the oil level before starting any engine make sure it is lubricated by checking the oil level if there is no oil or the oil level is too low do not start the engine otherwise it will heat up then will break down check the battery put in the key and turn the key clockwise until the lights turn on if the lights does not turn on that usually means the battery is dead and you need to recharge it or install a new one look for the choke lever or cut off switch for cold starting there is usually a choke lever or cut off switch on the handlebar on some bikes there may be a choke lever mounted on the carburetor operating this will provide the necessary rich fuel mixture when the motorcycle is cold when it hasn t been used for more than a few hours the dirtier the carburetor or the colder the engine is the more the choke will need to be engaged 2 x research source you don t need to use the choke lever when starting a motorcycle hot if the motorcycle has been running and the engine is already hot you won t need as much power to get it going just use a small amount of throttle and the engine should fire 3 x research source many bikes have a cut off switch on the kickstand so make sure that the kickstand is up as well having the bike in neutral will disable the kickstand shutoff open the choke lever make sure that the cut off switch is on you will need to leave the handlebar throttle twist grip closed while operating the starter motor or kick start lever otherwise the engine will flood making starting difficult or impossible remember the choke lever is usually not necessary if the bike has already been running in the past few hours 4 x research source turn your ignition to the on position your dash lights should light up when it s in this position also if your bike is in neutral as suggested then you should notice a green light indicating that you are in neutral start the engine squeeze and hold your clutch lever down located on the left and push the start button located on the right you should hear the blissful sound of your motorcycle cranking up close the choke and open the throttle shortly after the engine fires close the choke lever progressively and open the throttle slightly as the engine warms as you ride you may still need some choke for a short distance but close the choke lever as soon as possible to achieve smooth running do not over rev the motorcycle when it is warming up put the motorcycle into neutral you can almost always find this between first and second gear 5 x research source don t worry about the choke lever for electronically fuel injected motorcycles the engine management system will automatically look after fueling needs whether the engine is hot or cold there is no choke lever on these motorcycles use a small amount of throttle when starting either hot or cold pull the clutch in toward the handlebar it s usually on the the left hand side many riders choose to also pull in the front brake on the right handlebar at the same time press and hold in the start button this is usually located on the right handlebar near the bottom of where the hand will naturally rest try using the throttle if the motorcycle does not catch and start try using the throttle while pressing the start button make sure to keep the clutch held all of the way in while doing this,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to remove lug nuts and tires,whether you need to take off your car tire to change a flat rotate it or do some repairs you ll need to remove the lug nuts first it s important you remove the lug nuts and your tire safely so you don t get hurt by taking a few precautions and working slowly you can safely and successfully get your tire off your vehicle,use the appropriate tool to loosen the lug nuts before jacking the car up use your wrench or tire iron to break the lug nuts loose do not remove them completely but turn them a quarter turn or so in the counter clockwise direction each to make them loose enough to unscrew while the vehicle is in the air 1 x research source you can purchase tire irons from your local auto parts stores that usually have an end that fits all vehicles you may also choose to simply use a deep socket of the appropriate size with a ratchet or breaker bar remove the lug nuts because the lug nuts are already loose from before you lifted the car they should be fairly easy to unscrew the rest of the way use a wrench if need be to turn the lug nuts counter clockwise until they come off of the lug studs 2 x research source the wheel may shift as you remove the lug nuts so watch your fingers for pinches remove the lug nuts across from one another in a star pattern rather than each one in a row apply liquid thread loosen it if need be if the lug nuts have rusted over apply a generous amount of a thread loosener or rust remover to the nuts allow it to sit for a few minutes then attempt to loosen the lug nut again 3 x research source if the lug nut and stud break you will need to have a new lug stud installed in order to repair the vehicle be sure to use the correct sized socket a socket that is slightly too large could round off the lug nut a stripped or rounded lug nut will have to be cut off by a professional set the lug nuts aside someplace safe place the lug nuts in a safe place to be sure you don t lose them if you lose a lug nut you may be able to secure the wheel temporarily with the remaining nuts but if you lose more than one it will not be safe to drive the vehicle until they have been replaced 4 x research source you can purchase replacement lug nuts at your local auto parts store store the lug nuts in a small bowl or container so they can t roll away as you work pull the wheel toward you once the lug nuts have been removed place your hands on either side of the tire grip the back of the tire and pull it toward you to remove the wheel from the lug studs if the wheel has not been removed in a long time it may require quite a bit of force to pull the wheel off 5 x research source be careful if the tire is damaged there may be metal wire sticking out of it that can cut you wear gloves to pull on a damaged tire use a rubber mallet to loosen stuck on wheels if the wheel is seized in place and won t come off from you pulling on it use a rubber mallet to bang it loose strike the tire where the rim and tire meet all along the circumference of the wheel until it breaks loose 6 x research source do not use a metal hammer to hit the rims or you may damage them it may take a good deal of force to remove the stuck wheel if it is rusted in place locate the designated jack points for the vehicle each vehicle has specific points on the frame that are designed to withstand the weight of jacking up the vehicle these jack points are not always easily identified so refer to your vehicle s owner s manual to help you find them if you are having difficulty 7 x research source there are usually jack points on the frame of your car to the inside of each wheel and at a center point on the front and back of the car jacking the car up at a point that is not designed for it can cause damage to the frame of the vehicle close the valve on the jack trolley jacks utilize hydraulics to lift your vehicle off of the ground when the hydraulic valve is open the jack can t create pressure on the piston to lift the car use the handle of the jack to turn the valve clockwise until it is completely closed re insert the handle into the jack once done if you used the handle to close the valve different jacks may place the valve in different places but it is often a different color than the rest of the jack or is left unpainted completely if you are using a scissor jack there is no valve you need to close place the jack beneath the appropriate jack point slide your jack beneath the jack point closest to the wheel you intend to remove so the cup of the jack is sitting just beneath the frame you may need to raise the cup of the jack slightly by lifting the jack handle and pressing it back down or spinning it once to make sure the jack is positioned properly the cup on the jack should be centered on the designated jack point for the vehicle there are teeth or ridges on the cup of the jack to help prevent the car s frame from sliding as it s jacked up use the jack to lift the vehicle depending on the type of jack you are using you will need to either raise and lower the handle on a trolley jack or turn it on a scissor jack to raise the vehicle start slow paying close attention to the frame around the jack point to look for signs of bending or crimping of the metal if you see signs that the metal is bending lower the car and reposition the jack unto the jack point properly only jack the car up as high as necessary raising a vehicle up too high can increase the danger of it falling off of the jack or jack stands once it is high enough to change the tire place jack stands beneath it for safety do not place any part of your body under the vehicle unless you have jack stands in place to support it you only need to lift the vehicle up until the tire is no longer touching the ground to remove it find a firm even area to jack up the car as you jack up a portion of the car to remove the wheel the weight of that portion will be centered on the relatively small space beneath the jack as a result it is essential that you jack your car up in an area that can support the pressure concrete and blacktop are the best options for jacking up the car it is extremely unsafe to jack a vehicle up on an angle so it is also very important that you choose a level surface 8 x research source never jack up a vehicle on slanted or uneven surfaces jacking a car up on a surface that isn t strong enough can cause the jack to topple over or sink ensure you have space to work safely whether you re using an emergency jack or a trolley jack it s important to ensure you have enough room to work without putting yourself or others at risk make sure you have at least enough room to stand with an outstretched arm toward the jack without coming into contact with a wall or being in the street if you are replacing a flat tire 9 x research source make sure there s enough room to sit behind your jack without being in the lane of the road make sure the car is in park if your car is equipped with an automatic transmission it should be in park before you jack it up putting your car in park prevents the wheels from turning and will keep the vehicle from rolling off of the jack remember however your car may still shift when in park so it s important to utilize wheel chocks in conjunction with placing the vehicle in park 10 x research source remember that putting the car in park will lock its drive wheels in place so a front wheel drive car s front wheels won t turn in park and vice versa for a rear wheel drive vehicle if your car is equipped with a manual transmission try putting the car in first gear to prevent it from rolling you can place rocks or plastic wheel chocks purchased from an auto parts store behind the wheels to ensure they can t turn while you lift the vehicle engage the parking brake depending on the make and model of the vehicle the parking brake may be a handle in the center console or a pedal on your left side when sitting in the driver s seat pull up on the handle or press down on the pedal to engage the parking brake and prevent your vehicle from rolling while it s being jacked up 11 x research source your owner s manual can help you locate your parking brake if you are unsure the parking brake locks the rear wheels in place so it will not help if the entire back end of the car is in the air,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

when you re ready to start moving pull the handbrake down quickly shift your right foot from the brake to the accelerator begin releasing the clutch at the same time that you re pressing down on the accelerator to start moving 3 x research source if you start rolling backwards press the foot brake and pull the handbrake start again this can take some practice to get used to press the accelerator down and fully release the clutch as you press the accelerator down release the clutch completely to get up to speed you may notice the clutch biting or kicking back as you press the accelerator this is normal and is an indicator that you re able to release it and control the car with your accelerator 4 x research source biting refers to the friction you feel in the clutch when you re accelerating the car as you rev the engine up the clutch is trying to mitigate the speed of the wheels causing some friction in the pedal pull the handbrake up while pressing the clutch down press the clutch down with your left foot press the button on the top of the handbrake to release it and pull the handbrake all the way up to its vertical position keep the clutch held down all the way while doing this 5 x research source this method is a little easier if you struggle shuffling your foot quickly from the brake to the accelerator it s basically the same as the first method except you re using the handbrake instead of the foot brake turn the car on and shift into 1st gear turn the key in the ignition to start the car do not shift your feet or move the handbrake while doing this shift into 1st gear 6 x research source apply gas with your right foot while releasing the clutch slowly apply pressure to the accelerator while releasing the clutch when you feel the clutch biting or kicking back you will know that your vehicle is trying to move forward 7 x research source release the handbrake at the same time as the clutch once the clutch is biting press the button on the handbrake down move it forward at the same time as you re pressing the accelerator down to release the brake and move the car forward 8 x research source essentially you re releasing the handbrake and clutch at the same time that you re accelerating there may be some discrepancy between the clutch and the handbrake if you re on a really steep incline hold the brake and clutch down with both feet if you re starting out on a hill facing down start by holding the clutch and footbrake down with both of your feet keep the clutch and brake held all the way down 9 x research source keep your handbrake set in the vertical position while you re doing this start the car and shift into 1st gear with your car in neutral turn the key in the ignition to start the car move the shifter into 1st gear do not move your feet off of the clutch or brake while doing this 10 x research source release the handbrake slowly and grip the steering wheel put your hand on the steering wheel and use your other hand to press the button on the handbrake down slowly release the handbrake to release your car s wheels from the locked position 11 x research source your car may slowly drift forward while you re releasing the handbrake so do this slowly to monitor your speed release the foot brake and clutch at the same time slowly after you ve released the handbrake lift your feet slowly off of the foot brake and the clutch your car will start rolling forward down the hill use your hand to steer the car down the hill 12 x research source once you get used to doing this you can release the clutch foot brake and handbrake at the same time use the accelerator to bring the car up to your desired speed with your clutch and both brakes released shift your right foot to the accelerator and use it to control your car s speed if you need to slow down use the brake and clutch to cut back on speed 13 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to buy a bicycle,when you go to a bike shop to buy a bicycle you might feel overwhelmed by the selection luckily by doing some background research and appraising your needs you can easily find the best bike for you in almost no time you ll be ready to put on a helmet and enjoy your new bike,choose a road bike if you ll be traveling primarily on paved roads road bikes are mainly for riding on roads and highways because they have lighter frames slimmer tires and no suspension systems that absorb shock 1 x research source road bikes are a good fit for riders with a strong back and flexibility for riding in a bent position there are many subcategories of road bike including cyclocross touring adventure road triathlon and fitness if you re going to be using the bike for a specific sport or activity consider getting one of these specialized bikes pick a mountain bike for hitting the trails mountain bikes are best for riding on rocky trails and adventuring off of paved roads the tires are large with significant tread which helps to grab the surface and propel you forward when you re going uphill 2 x research source the frames are heavier with a suspension system to absorb shock and straight handlebars that allow the rider to sit upright opt for a hybrid bicycle if you switch between road and mountain biking hybrid bicycles can be used for a combination of street and off road biking the frame is adjusted to be comfortable for both mountain and road biking while the rider sits in an upright position if you re using your bike to commute or for casual riding on roads and on trails a hybrid might be the best option for you it offers some of the ruggedness of a mountain bike with some of the speed of a road bike dual sport bikes are a specific subcategory of hybrid bikes that allow for transition between road and mountain biking look for specialty bikes if you have special needs for riding specialty bikes are great solutions for people who have physical challenges that can prevent them for riding or those who just want a different riding experience some speciality bikes allow you to sit in a different position and others are made for easier transportation 3 x research source recumbent and semi recumbent bicycles allow the rider to sit in a lower position with their legs out in front of them they tend to incur less stress on the back muscles and can be easier to mount for riders who use wheelchairs foldable bicycles are perfect for riders on the go or people who have limited storage space most foldable bicycles are recumbent but there are some full sized foldable bikes tandem bicycles or buddy bikes allow 2 riders at once and can be useful for people who are learning how to ride and balance on a bike decide which features are most important to you depending on your needs you might want a bike with many speeds or gears or a bike with no crossbar gears allow you to control how easy or difficult it is to pedal depending on the terrain bikes with no crossbars are sometimes easier to mount but the crossbar increases the strength of the frame 4 x research source as a general rule women s frames tend to have lower or no crossbar while men s have a high horizontal crossbar however frames are often interchangeable and you don t have to purchase the frame that corresponds with your gender 5 x research source purchase an entry level bike if you re a beginner look for bikes that are comfortable and have easy controls some bikes are marketed as entry level or beginner bikes because they re easy to just hop on and ride they tend to be slightly less expensive and have more versatile options for adding racks and accessories 6 x research source an entry level bike will allow you to grow into the bike while still being comfortable on your first rides some beginner road bikes are designed so the rider is in a more comfortable upright position rather than the traditional bent position take your height and inseam measurements to determine your frame size the appropriate frame size for your bike is determined by the size of your body use a flexible tape measure to get your height and inseam lengths which will allow you to make adjustments for seat height handlebar height and more consult a sizing chart to see which size frame is right for your height 7 x research source some stores will switch out parts and customize your bike to your body type if you have the measurements taken in the shop frame sizes range between xxs xxl and are standard between all brands however frame sizes can differ slightly for different types of bikes so make sure you re looking at the appropriate chart 8 x research source keep an eye out for first time buyer sales and deals even if you re on a tight budget you can likely find a bike that fits your needs many stores offer sales and new buyer incentives and you can look online for used bikes for sale by experienced riders shop around to get an idea of the cost of most bikes and start saving 9 x research source remember to leave money in your budget for biking gear like a helmet reflectors and lights and a bike lock at the very minimum gear helps to keep you and your bike safe while you ride research bikes online to see reviews specifications and prices often buyers will leave reviews on websites if they bought a specific bike their feedback can give you an idea of the pros and cons of a bike and warn you about any issues that previous buyers have had in the past 10 x research source look for bikes with high quality frames that get good reviews for sturdiness and comfort when you go into a bike store you can mention that you ve done online research but don t expect the shop to price match normally shops aren t able to offer the same prices as online retailers because of their specialized stock and the cost of hiring experienced technicians ask fellow cyclists what they recommend for your skill level and needs if you have friends who are cyclists ask them for bike recommendations before you buy a bicycle chances are they ll be more open about what you need from a bike especially if they re more experienced 11 x research source if you don t know any cyclists send an email your local cycling club or go to a meeting to meet fellow bike enthusiasts come prepared with questions and be ready to talk about biking visit reputable bike shops in your area narrow your search by selecting the type of bike that you want and find a store that specializes in that type be prepared to travel a bit to get to the store and come prepared with your budget constraints if you need extra time with the salesperson try to visit on a weekday when they re not as busy 12 x research source walk around the sales floor and check out the bikes that you ve researched tell the salesperson about your abilities and goals and ask for recommendations be wary of a salesperson who steers you toward a significantly different type of bike particularly if that bike is out of your price range remember to take their suggestions into account and ask questions if a salesperson recommends a different style feel free to ask them why make sure their explanation is reasonable and not motivated by making a sale big box stores like walmart and some sporting goods stores might have some bikes that interest you if you know what you want and won t need any assistance selecting your bike check those stores sit on the bike to check the fit survey your body position the accessibility of the controls and your comfort level ask yourself if you could maintain that position for a long period of time while biking without getting stiff or uncomfortable 13 x research source notice the distance from the seat to the bottom of the pedal stroke and the angle at which you have to lean to hold the handlebars the size of the frame is one of the few aspects of the bike that can t be altered so take your time to try several different options and find the best fit the retailer will be able to recommend a few different frames for you to test out check the quality tread and size of the tires if you re buying a used bike this is especially important for ensuring your safety squeeze the tires to make sure they re inflated and check to make sure the tread and sidewalls look normal for the type of bike that you re buying if you re buying a new bike ask the salesperson if the tires have anti flat technology for your safety test drive the bike to see if you like it like a car a bike is usually something you want to try out before you purchase it aim for a 15 20 minute test ride on each model that you re considering most shops encourage test driving to ensure that the customer is comfortable on the bike 14 x research source your body should feel comfortable as you ride with your knees bending slightly at the bottom of the pedal revolution you should be able to reach the brakes easily and your upper body shouldn t feel cramped on a flat surface make sure that the bicycle handles turn smoothly and that you can sit and stand easily while riding negotiate a reasonable price for the bike although small shops can t always price match you can ask about sales and other deals many salespeople will be happy to work with you to find a reasonable price for the bike especially if their original price seems much higher than what you ve seen elsewhere 15 x research source one of the best ways to negotiate is by adding free services such as regular tune ups general repairs in case of an accident or even a discount on gear ask if the salesperson will add some extra perks to your purchase to sweeten the deal do a quick search of the bicycle that you want to buy if you have a bike in mind a quick search of the brand and type of bike will show you most of the websites where it s listed for sale get a good idea of the price for the bike and see if there are any retailers near you that carry that model 16 x research source look for retailers in your area who have brick and mortar stores as well as online purchase options that way you can test drive the bike at the store and then buy the bike you want online in some cases you can purchase the bike online but have it shipped to a store to save on shipping costs browse various websites for sales and deals on bikes check out sites like ebay and craigslist for used bikes for new bikes check out major retailers like rei for mountain bikes and brand websites 17 x research source ebay can be a reasonable choice for shoppers on a budget because you can place bids remember you will likely have to pay for shipping if you buy from ebay and that can be expensive be sure to check the seller s feedback to make sure they re reputable craigslist allows you to pick up your bike locally and you probably won t have to assemble it this gives you the added benefit of potentially being able to sit on and test drive the bike before you buy major brand and corporate websites will have plenty of stock and can often offer more competitive prices for their bikes use the chat feature to ask questions if the website has one buying a bike online can involve a lot of guesswork but there are still ways that you can ask questions to the seller if you re buying a used bike use the ebay chat function or send an email through craigslist for new bikes look for the website s customer service email or phone number 18 x research source ask questions about the welds frame breaks measurements tires chains and anything else you can think of for used bikes go out of your way to ask the seller if the bike has any body damage to the frame or if it has had repairs done previously if you receive the bike and it s damaged you can use the messages as proof for filing a complaint with the website order your bike and wait for it to arrive some bikes will arrive partially assembled while others will need complete assembly if you re getting it shipped to a store they may assemble it for you and you might be able to do a test drive before you leave with your purchase 19 x research source keep the confirmation email from the order for your records in case you need to return the bike if your bike comes in pieces take it to your local bike shop and pay someone to assemble it for maximum safety test drive the bike after it s put together if you don t like it check the website for the company s return policy in many cases you can disassemble it and ship it back or return it to a brick and mortar store,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to ship a bicycle cheaply,instead of paying a lot of money for inefficient shipping you should investigate ways to reduce your costs when you want to send a bike to a different location one of the biggest factors in reducing your bike shipping costs is minimizing the size of the container you re going to ship the bike in take the right steps by disassembling your bike shipping it in the right container and exploring ways to reduce your shipping costs,use an allen key to unscrew the handlebars from the bike put the allen key into the screw on the front of your handlebars turn the wrench counterclockwise to loosen the screw once it s loose you should be able to lift your handlebars from their housing 1 x research source place the screws and bolts in a zip lock bag to keep the smaller parts together for when you want to reassemble the bike later remove the pedals depending on what kind of pedals you have you ll need either an allen key or a 15mm wrench press down on the pedal with your foot and hold the brake to prevent your bike and pedals from moving bend down and insert the allen key or use the wrench to loosen the bolt on the opposite side of the pedal continue to unscrew the bolt until the pedal comes off 2 x research source you may need a friend to help you hold the bike in place while you unscrew the pedals remove the front wheel if you have a quick release wheel all you ll need to do is undo the latch on the front of the wheel and turn the latch counterclockwise to loosen the wheel 3 x research source if your wheel is secured with a bolt you ll need a 15mm wrench to remove it loosen the bolt on the center of the wheel by turning the wrench counter clockwise you may have to loosen the brakes to remove the wheel unscrew and take off your seat find the bolts that are holding your seat to the frame of the bike and remove them with an allen key these bolts will be somewhere under the seat some bikes will have two bolts that you need to undo while others will just have one turn the key counterclockwise to loosen the bolt until the seat comes off your bike should now be mostly unassembled and ready for transport 4 x research source let the air out of your tires by pressing the needle on the nozzle deflate your tires to make more room in your shipping container for the rest of the bike doing this will also prevent the tubes from popping while you re shipping it unscrew the caps on your bike s tires and softly press down on the needle in the center of the valve to release the air from the tires 5 x research source don t squeeze your tires before you depress the needle or you may damage them get a cardboard bike box at a bike shop find a box made for the same style of bike that you have see if you can try to get the box for free if the bike shop doesn t have any boxes you can purchase one online for a low fee 6 x research source purchase a bike travel case for more expensive bikes bike travel cases are more expensive than a cardboard box but provide additional protection for your bike if you are shipping a more expensive bike consider using a travel case this may save you money in the long run because you won t have to pay for costly bike repairs 7 x research source purchase and cut plumbing insulation to the size of your frame purchase pipe insulation online or at a hardware store this foam material can wrap around the frame of your bike and prevent it from getting damaged during transport measure the length on the different parts of your bike s frame and cut the foam insulation to the same size 8 x research source if you re trying to save even more money you can use bubble wrap instead of plumbing insulation tape or tie the insulation around your bike frame wrap the insulation around the frame of your bike and wrap duct tape or zip ties around the insulation and frame this will secure the foam insulation to your bike s frame and hold it in place 9 x research source wrap loose parts with bubble wrap take your wheel handlebars and pedals and wrap them with bubble wrap secure the wrap with tape and set them aside you should also cover any remaining exposed parts of your bike with whatever bubble wrap you have left over place the frame of the bike into the container first place the bike s frame and back wheel into the top of the container double check to make sure that your bike box is large enough to accommodate the bike s size 10 x research source if you have a heavy bike you may need someone to help hold the box in place as you put the frame in it place the rest of the parts into the container carefully place the rest of the parts into the container sliding them up as close to the frame as possible once you position all of the parts close the box and make sure that the sides are not bulging 11 x research source if the sides are bulging see if you can rearrange the parts in the box so that it doesn t if the frame is causing the sides of the box to bulge you ll need a larger box tape the box closed close all the flaps on the box and apply several coats of tape over the flaps once you feel like the box is secure you re done packing away your bike 12 x research source decide which shipping company you want to use compare the prices from different shipping companies so that you can find the cheapest option major shipping companies like fedex usps and ups can ship your bike for a fee there are also other services like bikeflights sports express and shipbikes com that specifically ship bicycles measure the dimensions of your bike and determine how much each service would cost 13 x research source print out a shipping label you can usually calculate the cost and print and pay for shipping online go to the website for the shipping company that you re going to use and fill out the order information tape your shipping label to the box securely make sure to go over the front of the label with a clear masking tape so that the label won t get damaged in transit 14 x research source if you can t print the label online you ll have to visit a shipping facility have the bike s destination on hand when filling out the shipping label some companies won t ship your box unless all over the edges of the shipping label are securely taped to the box take your bike to a shipping facility and pay the fee to send it take your package and bring it to the closest shipping facility if you weren t able to get a label online you can now get one at the facility they will weigh and measure the package for you and then tell you how much it will cost shipping a bike that weighs 50 pounds 23 kg can cost anywhere from 100 400 keep your shipping container as small as possible some shipping companies will charge you based on the size of your box not the weight of your bike if your shipping company is charging by box size choose the smallest box you can find use basic shipping most of the time shipping companies will have a slower ground option that you can choose choosing this option will usually take longer but will cost you less take your bike on an airline flight check the regulations and fees associated with traveling with your bike some airlines offer to transport your bike in the plane this prevents the likelihood the bike will get lost and can sometimes cost less than shipping it 15 x research source consider insuring your bike if it s expensive while the price of insurance will raise your overall cost it will prevent you from having to buy a new one if it s lost in transit this is especially useful if you re shipping the bike

how to clean battery terminals,whether you re dealing with the battery in your car or an ordinary household battery including 9v batteries tend to build up dirt and sometimes to corrode battery grime can cause acid to leak from your battery and can also decrease the overall life of your battery clean the battery by washing and scraping off dirt and corrosion from the connection points keeping your battery connections clean can not only help your battery live longer but can also save you money,lift the hood of your car and assess the condition of the battery you do not need to remove the battery from the vehicle to assess it or to clean it to simply access the battery pop open the car hood and locate the battery it s typically on the front left side of the engine block visually inspect the general condition of your car battery if the battery is not cracked or leaking battery acid you can go ahead and start cleaning 1 x research source if your battery case has cracks you should replace the entire battery visit a local auto parts store and purchase a battery there assess the degree of corrosion on the battery and cables lift up and to the sides the plastic covers on top of the battery this will reveal the terminal clamp interface examine the battery cables and clamps for excess wear or corrosion corrosion appears as a white ashy deposit around one or both battery posts if the cables and clamps are lightly corroded or have just a little buildup follow the instructions below on how to clean them 2 x research source if the damage is extensive you may want to completely replace the cables and clamps to avoid future problems disconnect the negative and positive clamps on your car battery before cleaning the battery you ll need to disconnect the battery to do this loosen the nuts on the clamps using a wrench once loosened remove the negative clamp marked with a first only after the negative clamp is removed remove the positive clamp marked with a 3 x research source the clamps may prove difficult to remove especially if there is a lot of corrosion you may need to use pliers to remove them if you do need to use pliers be careful not to touch the tool to the car frame or anything else metal and the battery while working doing so will short out the battery make a cleaning agent out of baking soda and water combine 2 3 tablespoons 30 44 ml of baking soda with 1 tablespoon 15 ml of distilled water in a small bowl stir the ingredients together with a spoon to make a thick paste keep stirring until all of the bits of baking soda are fully dissolved in the water 4 x research source baking soda is alkaline which means that it s capable of neutralizing corrosion from battery acid apply the baking soda paste to the battery connections dip an old toothbrush or a lightly dampened rag into the baking soda paste rub the paste onto the corroded or dirty parts of your car s battery once the baking soda is applied you will see it bubble and foam as it reacts with the corrosion give the baking soda mix at least 5 10 minutes to soak in and loosen the corrosion 5 x research source be careful while you re applying the paste although baking soda is generally safe you should take care not to get it on other car components scrape off corrosion deposits with an old butter knife if your battery terminals have heavy deposits use the sharper edge of a used butter knife to scrape them off hold the knife s blade at a 45 degree angle and press it downward along the surface of the battery to chip off bits of corrosion after you have removed the major deposits use a wire brush or steel wool to remove any remaining deposits 6 x research source wear vinyl dishwashing gloves while cleaning the terminals especially if you re scrubbing off corrosion with steel wool your hands will be coming in direct contact with potentially caustic agents and vinyl gloves are the best protection 7 x research source there are special battery post and battery clamp brushes available at most auto parts stores but these are not necessary in most cases a general steel brush works fine rinse the battery with water once you ve brushed it clean when the baking soda mixture stops foaming and there are no major deposits left to be scraped off you can go ahead and rinse all of the corrosion dust and drying baking soda off of the battery pour about 2 cups 470 ml of distilled water over the battery and the positive and negative terminals 8 x research source be careful not to rinse the baking soda paste into the battery vents as the baking soda can neutralize the battery s acid and shorten the battery s life the vents are located on the sides of the battery and are connected to long vent tubes that direct harmful gases away from the vehicle s cabin wipe the terminals clean with a clean dry rag dry the entire battery thoroughly before reconnecting it to your vehicle make sure that the terminals are completely dry by rubbing the dry rag over them 2 3 times be sure to use a rag that doesn t have any grease or oil on it 9 x research source don t use paper towels for this step the paper will shred leaving you with bits of paper towel stuck to your battery terminals smear petroleum jelly onto the clean terminals to prevent corrosion dip 2 fingers into a jar of petroleum jelly and smear a thin layer across both the positive and negative terminals make sure your vinyl gloves are still on while you do this applying hydrophobic petroleum jelly to the now cleaned terminals will prevent corrosion from occurring again in the future 10 x research source if you don t already have petroleum jelly at your home purchase some at a drugstore or pharmacy reattach the 2 clamps back on to the battery to complete the cleaning you need to reattach the clamps that you removed earlier to secure the battery in place and restore the electrical connection reattach the positive clamp to the battery first by tightening it with a wrench once it s firmly in place then you can attach the negative clamp to the negative terminal on the battery use a wrench to tighten that clamp in place as well 11 x research source once the clamps are on replace the rubber or plastic shields covering the clamp terminal junction examine the battery cradle s terminals and the battery for corrosion open the device s cover to access the battery cradle remove the battery cover to inspect the degree of corrosion assess these old batteries for cracks and leakage mild corrosion will appear as black spots more severe corrosion appears as a white ashy deposit around one or both battery posts or terminals 12 x research source if you find a battery that s leaking acid and not merely corroded throw it away immediately any leakage is likely potassium hydroxide a strong base be sure to wear skin and eye protection when cleaning out the battery cradle as potassium hydroxide is caustic if a device is powered by more than 1 battery it s possible for 1 battery to be corroded and another to be in fine shape pull out any non corroded batteries and set them aside you ll reinsert them later once you ve cleaned off corroded batteries and the cradle the following baking soda cleaning method is just for any corrosion around the terminals not for a leaking battery mix together baking soda and water to make a cleaning paste make your cleaning agent by combining 2 3 tablespoons 30 44 ml of baking soda with 1 tablespoon 15 ml of water stir the components with a spoon to make a thick paste 13 x research source take care not to get baking soda on other electronic components e g whatever electrical device the batteries that you are cleaning were housed in rub any corrosion off of the battery terminals with a cotton swab dip a cotton swab into the baking soda mixture smear the baking soda paste onto the battery connections and the 2 terminals at the end of each battery using the cotton swab once the baking soda is applied you may see it bubble and foam as it reacts with the corrosion let it soak in for about 5 minutes 14 x research source wear vinyl dishwashing gloves while cleaning any battery corrosion take care not to touch with bare skin the white crusty buildup as it is caustic and could burn your skin be careful not to get any water on your electronics when cleaning wipe the battery and cradle off with distilled water and a cotton swab when the foaming stops and there are no major deposits left to be scraped out you re ready to rinse off the inside of the cradle dip 1 clean cotton swab into a cup of distilled water then dab the cotton swab back and forth along the inside of the battery cradle this will clear out any lingering baking soda and clean the connections so they re ready to receive electrical current 15 x

how to calibrate a torque wrench,mechanics rely on torque wrenches to provide accurate and reliable torque readings so they can apply the right amount of force on the nuts and bolts in a vehicle however torque wrenches need to be calibrated regularly to make sure they re giving accurate readings while it may be best to take your torque wrench to a professional for calibrations you can do a pretty good job of keeping your torque wrench accurate by calibrating it at home,measure from the square drive to the handle the square drive is the end of the torque wrench you d attach a socket to for the sake of simplicity use whole inches rather than using any fractions mark the point you measured to on the handle and record the distance on a piece of paper for you to come back to later 1 x research source set the paper aside in a safe space until you need it because 24 inches 61 cm is a common length for most torque wrenches it will serve as the measurement for further steps secure the square drive in the vice orient your bench vice so you can place the square drive of the torque wrench into and have the handle extend out away from the table or bench then insert the square drive into the vice and tighten it until it s secure 2 x research source be careful not to overtighten the vice and damage the square drive on the torque wrench make sure only the square drive itself is caught in the clamp so the wrench can move under the weight you apply calculate the appropriate setting for your weight in order to determine the right setting for the torque wrench multiply the distance you measured in step 2 by the 20 pounds 9 1 kg you will be using for your weight that comes out to 480 inch 1 000 cm pounds 24 inches 61 cm times 20 pounds 9 1 kg which equates to 40 foot 12 2 m pounds 3 x research source be sure to use the correct distance and weight figures if your wrench is a different size or you re using different weights your figures will be different the equation will still be handle distance times weight then divided by 12 hang the weights from the handle of the wrench tie the rope to the weight and make a loop that you can hang from the handle of the torque wrench where you made your mark in step 1 make sure the length of rope is short enough that the weight won t touch the ground once you hang it 4 x research source do not securely tie the weight to the wrench instead simply hang it be sure nothing is in the way of or supporting the weight as it hangs adjust the torque wrench using the weight you can usually adjust the spring tension in a torque wrench by turning a screw located midway up the wrench s handle with a screwdriver hang the 20 pounds 9 1 kg weight from the torque wrench at your first mark and see if it clicks if it doesn t tighten the spring by turning the screw clockwise then lift the weight and lower it again to test it 5 x research source repeat this process until the torque wrench clicks using the known weight be sure to lift the weight off the wrench and lower it again to test for clicking each time move the weights up the handle if you hear a click listen for a click from the torque wrench as you hang the weight from the marked point on the handle if you hear one lift the weight off the handle and set it down again further up the neck moving toward the head of the wrench 6 x research source keep repeating this process until you stop hearing the click be sure to lift the weight off and set it down again each time do not slide it up the handle lower the weights if you don t hear a click if you don t hear a click from the torque wrench as you place the weight on it move the weight down the handle of the wrench until you do hear one 7 x research source start by moving the weight an inch or so at a time it s okay to move up and down the handle of the wrench more than once as you look for the point in which it starts to click mark the point of transition once you find the point in which the handle transitions from clicking to not mark it on the wrench with your pen be sure to mark the point exactly so you may need to make multiple attempts at identifying where it is by moving the weight up and down the handle the part of the handle where it begins or stops clicking is called the transition point measure from the square drive to the point of transition use the measuring tape to find the distance from the square drive to the transition point you identified using the weight record that number on a piece of paper and set it aside a measurement of 26 inches 66 cm will be used for this example but yours may be different 8 x research source be careful not to confuse this number with the figure you recorded in step 2 you may want to test finding the transition point more than once to be sure you have the correct number calculate the applied torque if the transition point of the torque wrench with 20 pounds 9 1 kg was at 26 inches 66 cm for instance multiple that by 20 pounds 9 1 kg to determine the amount of torque actually applied so 26 inches 66 cm times 20 pounds 9 1 kg equals 520 inch 1 000 cm pounds or 50 foot 15 2 m pounds 520 divided by 12 inches 30 cm 9 x research source the equation is the same as before measurement length times weight divided by 12 correct for the difference you identify if you are unable to adjust the torque wrench you can still use it pretty accurately if you adjust the settings you use on the wrench to compensate for the difference divide your first measurement by the transition point in this case 24 divided by 26 which equals 923 whenever you need to use the torque wrench multiply the correct torque by this number 10 x research source multiplying your intended torque by the difference will give you the correct setting for your specific torque wrench this solution can keep you working but the wrench will still need to be calibrated return the scale to zero after each use while all torque wrenches will need to be calibrated regularly you can prolong the life of each calibration by returning the setting of the torque wrench to zero after each time you use it 11 x research source the strain on the internal spring can cause the calibration to drift if not left on zero keep a tight grip on the torque wrench dropping your torque wrench onto any sort of hard surface can instantly affect the tool s calibration be sure to set the torque wrench down in safe places to avoid letting it fall and never use a torque wrench in place of a hammer or lever 12 x research source banging a torque wrench around will immediately affect its calibration torque wrenches have even been known to break when dropped use the torque wrench only for appropriate tasks because a torque wrench looks similar to a breaker bar people often make the mistake of using them interchangeably a torque wrench should only be used in instances that require specific torque specifications using it for other jobs can affect its ability to maintain its calibration 13 x research source using a torque wrench in place of a breaker bar or different type of wrench can affect calibration or even damage the wrench treat the torque wrench as as speciality tool rather than an all purpose one stay within the torque wrench s upper and lower limits exceeding the prescribed limits of a torque wrench can damage it or might affect the wrench s calibration many torque wrenches have clearly indicated upper and lower torque tolerances never use the wrench for jobs that require more or less torque than your wrench is rated for 14 x research source exceeding the maximum torque rating for a wrench may even break it if you damage your torque wrench it may not be able to hold a calibration any longer store your torque wrench in its case and by itself because torque wrenches can be so easily affected by impacts and even temperature changes it s best that you store your torque wrench inside its protective case and separate from other commonly used tools 15 x research source store the torque wrench low so if it does fall it won t be far enough to cause any significant damage to the calibration keep the torque wrench in a climate controlled area big shifts in temperature or humidity can affect its calibration,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to install a new handlebar grip,new grips can make a bike feel like brand new while an admittedly small part of the bike handlebar grips and tape are a key factor in how comfortable you are on the bike the good news is that you don t need a bike shop to get install your own handlebar grips,carefully slide or cut off the old grip sometimes careful cutting with a razor blade is necessary try not to scratch your chrome if you want to save the grips without cutting spray wd 40 between grip and handlebar giving it 5 10 minutes to work its way into the grip twist to spread the wd 40 inside the grip and pull it off easily stick a screwdriver between the bar and the grip if you cannot get under the grip well using it to prop the grip up while you spray it down if stuck you can use compressed air from a compressor or can to remove a grip 1 x research source clean bar with soap water to remove wd 40 dust and gunk give the bars a good clean scrub using an old rag or sponge to get them as clean as possible this will make it much easier to get the new grip on and keep it there when done dry the whole thing off if they are open on the ends make sure you dry off the inside of the handlebar as well water left in there after putting the new grip on can lead to rusting use 3 4 long plastic ties as runners to slide your grip on place the plastic ties in the grip on different sides then use these smooth low friction areas to slide the grip onto the bike then simply pull the ties back out to finish installing note that lock on grips are gaining popularity they require a hex wrench allen key but you can easily loosen the bolt slide the grip on then tighten it in place 2 x research source apply a spray of hairspray hand sanitizer or other quick evaporating substance inside the grip if you don t have plastic ties a little bit of an alcohol based product such as hairspray or sanitizer may help you slide the grip easily as a bonus the grip will definitely stay on once you ve got it in place while not strictly necessary this step can prevent the grip from immediately slipping off the bar if you have issues 3 x research source push the grip all the way onto the bar twisting to align their contours 4 x research source it can help to twist as you push working it onto the handlebar bit by bit while the snug fit may make it hard to get the grip on you ll be thankful later when it doesn t come off mid ride 5 x research source cut or unwind the old handlebar tape you will rarely have to cut the tape off and you should be careful not to nick the actual handlebar if you do more often than not you can simply unwind the old tape off the bike remove the cap at the end of the handlebars using a flat head screwdriver if needed 6 x research source before removing note how far up the bars the old tape went this is a good guide for when to end your own tape up wash off any lumps of adhesive left by the old tape use a gentle degreaser or some simply warm water and dish soap to lightly remove the rest of the adhesive 7 x research source set up your workstation and prepare the bars for taping take some electrical tape and wrap any cables lightly to the bars if they are not already pre attached note where you want the tape to end and get your knife or scissors ready to cut the excess tape when you re finished 8 x research source feeling extra pro wrap some double sided tape around the bottom 2 3 inches of the bar to help keep your tape in place 9 x research source start each handlebar from the bottom wrapping clockwise on the right and counter clockwise on the left handlebars need to be wrapped in a way that prevents unwinding while you ride starting from the bottom prevents the wrap from sliding down under your hands furthermore wrapping in the right direction for each hand prevents you from unwrapping as you ride many people when tired clench their hands and twist them outwards pull the tape tight you want a lot of tension for a tight waterproof grip 10 x research source leave about half the tape hanging off the bottom of the bar on the first pass wrapping 3 4 times as you work up move up the bar overlapping slightly for 3 4 wraps then push the cap into the exposed wrap sucking it into the inside of the handlebar so that the cap holds the bottom of the tape in place repeat on both sides 11 x research source work slowly overlapping about a quarter of the tape with every turn as you move up the bar if there is adhesive in tape it is often covered pull off the covering now and slowly tightly wrap the tape up and around the bar you may have to pull and work the tape multiple times making sure there are no gaps it is often best to test the tension of the tape before starting give a good tug to feel how tightly you can pull on the tape without ripping it to avoid gaps where the bar bends you may have to overlap a bit more lift the lever body rubber covering at brakes shifters and wrap past this point to get to the top of the bars the top of the handlebars the flat part need to be wrapped in reverse as you finish the bottom of the bars get as close to the levers as you can then skip over a small area where the bars bend and just start wrapping the top of the bars reverse your wrapping direction for the top of the bars this will be easy if you skip past the lever covering as outlined above most riders will rotate their wrists back on the top bar potentially unraveling the tape this is why you change directions when getting to the top bar 12 x research source the right side should be wrapped counter clockwise the left side should be wrapped clockwise 13 x research source cut the tape at your desired length and finish wrapping you can overwrap it then use a pen to mark the points you want to cut it then simply follow this line with scissors for a clean professional tape up add some 2 3 wraps of electrical tape to hold the wrap in place at the very end of the tape use some finishing tape to secure the wrap in place add enough that it cannot be easily unwound usually using 1 2 on the tape and 1 2 on the bike frame for a better hold use a lit match to melt the tapes together in a few places welding your handlebar tape on 14 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to choose an auto transport company,if you want to move 1 or more cars from 1 area to another you may have to hire the services of an auto transport company however if you ve never hired an auto transport company before you may not know how to choose the best one or how to avoid scammers luckily by knowing how to research a company s services prices and trustworthiness you can be better able to choose an auto transport company that fits your needs,make a list of the companies that offer the specific services you need first make a list of the services you need from an auto transport company then research local companies online to find the ones that perform these services it would be a waste of time to try and contact a company that doesn t actually perform the service that you need from it 1 x research source for example you may require or strongly desire enclosed auto transport instead of open transport in that case you d want to make sure you were only considering companies that specifically offered enclosed auto transport some other specific services you might need include terminal to terminal service door to door service or crossing international borders check customer ratings and reviews for companies you re considering look at online reviews and ratings posted to business review websites by former customers and see what they have said about these companies ask your friends and family for their opinions of the companies as well if they have prior experience with them take any companies that seem unreliable or low quality off the list 2 x research source look for negative or critical reviews of each company and compare them to the positive reviews the company receives this is a good way to gauge whether customers of the company tend to be satisfied with their services refrain from choosing a company that asks for a wire transfer payment reliable legitimate auto transport companies almost always ask for payment in the form of checks or credit cards if a company prefers that you pay them in the form of a wire transfer there s a higher chance that it s an untrustworthy business 3 x trustworthy source better business bureau nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting marketplace trustworthiness by educating consumers and reviewing businesses go to source note that if a company accepts wire transfers but prefers that you pay with credit card or check that company is probably legitimate your main concern should be those companies that prefer to receive wire transfers look for spelling and grammar mistakes on the company s website genuine companies running reliable businesses tend to take more care in avoiding these types of mistakes on their sites lots of spelling and grammar mistakes often indicates that the website was put up quickly by a sham company 4 x trustworthy source better business bureau nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting marketplace trustworthiness by educating consumers and reviewing businesses go to source check for a valid motor carrier number if you re in the united states the u s department of transportation regulates all auto transport companies operating in the united states and requires each company to have an mc number any company that doesn t have this number is thus almost definitely a fraudulent company 5 x trustworthy source better business bureau nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting marketplace trustworthiness by educating consumers and reviewing businesses go to source if a company is legitimate it will make this number available on its website or will provide it when asked sham companies will either hide this number or provide a fake one to verify a company s mc number go to the department of transportation s federal motor carrier safety administration s electronic records website find out what carrier options the company offers a company can transport your car in 1 of 3 ways using an open carrier a multi carrier or an enclosed carrier open and multi carriers are the cheapest but they leave your car exposed to the elements enclosed carriers are best for luxury cars that you want to keep protected 6 x research source nearly every auto transport company will definitely offer open carrier transportation however you may need to look a little harder if you re set on using a company that offers enclosed transportation ask if the company offers any insurance plans find out as well whether your own auto insurance plan will adequately cover your car while the company is transporting it if not you may need to purchase insurance from the company itself 7 x research source never do business with a company that can t insure your car while it s being transported if anything happens to the car you may not be able to receive any sort of reimbursement if the company offers insurance for your car be sure to ask for proof of this insurance to make sure it s not a scam legitimate companies are legally required to provide proof of insurance upon request inquire about what payment arrangements you re able to make some companies require that you pay the full price of shipping your car upfront whereas others will offer you the option of paying this price in installments if you re not comfortable with or not willing to pay the full price in advance be sure to ask if the company offers payment plans for their clients 8 x research source a typical payment plan may have you submit regular payments to the company every month over a set period of time e g 6 months note that some companies may charge you a fee for paying in installments rather than in 1 lump sum look into what the company s cancellation policy is ask if they have a set deadline after which you d have to pay a fee to cancel your reservation with the company if you need to retain some flexibility in your schedule communicate this to the company s customer service representative and ask what options they provide for canceling or rescheduling your reservation 9 x research source for example a company may penalize you for canceling a reservation but allow you to reschedule your reservation at no cost if the company offers you a unique cancellation policy or any other special service be sure to get the terms of this policy or service in writing call or visit the website of a transport company to get a quote most auto transport company websites will have a large button at the top of the home page that says get quote or request quote it s almost always free to request a price quote so don t worry about having to commit to the company just because you re requesting a quote 10 x research source you can also call the company s customer service phone number to get a quote this phone number is also located on the company s website and is almost definitely on any promotional material e g flyers that the company puts out get quotes from several companies with good reviews contact each of the companies you ve deemed to be trustworthy and ask how much it would cost for you to transport your car with them be sure to give them all of the specifics regarding your car and how you d like them to transport it 11 x research source you ll need to provide the make and model of your car as well as the shipping locations and dates don t agree to any offers immediately just get quotes from all of the companies you re considering so you can compare the offers to one another avoid settling for the cheapest option although you may think the lowest priced company will be giving you the best deal these companies often surprise customers with hidden fees down the line plus the lower quoted price the lower quality service you can usually expect from auto transport companies 12 x research source it s normal to see quotes within 100 of each other anything way lower could be a bait and switch or have hidden fees hidden fees may include the cost of insurance or a service fee decide which company is best for your particular situation once you ve gotten a sense of each company s services reputation and price you re now in the best position possible to choose the right company for you if you re still not

how to size a bike,having the wrong size bike is not only inefficient and slow but it can also lead to stress injuries or dangerous loss of control luckily finding the right size bike for you is not incredibly difficult have some patience for measurements and try out a few bikes and you ll be riding in comfort and style in no time,know that you must buy the right frame for your style of riding the frame is the metal or carbon fiber body of the bike and unlike the handlebars or seat known as a saddle it is not adjustable thus buying the proper frame is the most important thing you can do when shopping for a bike there is a variety of frames available on the market but the frame shape generally changes based on the type of riding the bike is made for know however that there are as many different frame configurations as there are bike makers each with specialized functions however the general shape of the bike helps determine its function more often than not road bikes are most often used by commuters fitness and racing fitness riding the frames are usually large isosceles all sides the same length triangles with a top bar or top tube that is parallel to the ground racing bikes usually have smaller frames while touring or commuter bikes often have larger frames road bike frame sizes are measured in centimeters mountain bikes have a lower center of gravity to keep you on balance riding over roots rocks and mud on the trail the center triangle is more compact with the top tube sometimes angling down away from the handlebars mountain bike frame sizes are measured in inches hybrid bikes combine features of road and mountain bikes you can use these for both street riding and casual trail riding these frames are usually measured in centimeters cruiser bikes have odd sideways s shaped or curved frames that allow you to sit nearly upright while riding the handlebars are high above the seat and the pedals slightly in front of you so that you comfortably cruise around town sometimes called city bikes or commuter bikes these are made for short distances fitting these bikes is less about measurements than pure comfort on a test ride 1 x research source kids bikes have smaller frames similar to mountain bikes helping them keep their balance with a lower center of gravity they are very adjustable to compensate for quickly growing kids they are usually measured by wheel size 2 x research source take your inseam measurement the most important bike measurement there is stand with your feet 6 inches apart then measure from the inside of your foot up to your crotch where your leg meets your waist think of the seam on the inside of a pair of jeans you need to measure the distance from the bottom of your foot to where your seat should be if you are sizing a mountain bike measure in inches if you are sizing a road bike measure in centimeters 3 x research source for the most precise measurement take a thick hardcover book and sit on the spine as if it was your bike seat still standing measure to the top of the book from the floor use your inseam to calculate seat tube length for road bikes multiply your inseam measurement in centimeters by 67 to get your suggested seat tube bar reaching from seat to pedals length 4 x research source the seat tube is usually though not always measured from the top of the tube to the center point of the crankshaft 5 x research source know that this measurement is simply a starting point you will likely need to make specific adjustments later on use your inseam to find the proper length of your top tube for mountain bikers multiply your inseam in inches by 67 then subtract 4 from the answer to get the length of your top tube 6 x research source use the top tube for your measurement when possible if you are a mountain biker as seat tube pedals to seat measurements are tricky and change from manufacturer to manufacturer 7 x research source for example if you have a 33 inch inseam you would need a 17 5 top tube 17 75 tubes are hard to find 33 x 67 21 75 21 75 4 17 75 some mountain bikers prefer to measure by seat tube length like road bikers if your bike shop gives frame size by seat tube length take your inseam and multiply it by 185 the resulting number is the recommended distance between your seat and the middle of the crankshaft which is the circular piece the pedal rotates on 8 x research source use wheel diameter to help purchase children s bikes most kid bikes are adjustable accommodating random growth spurts so you don t need to buy a new bike every year that said a child s bike should still fit them so they can put their feet flat on the ground while they re sitting on the saddle for a child s inseam of 12 17 inches 12 inch wheels for a child s inseam of 18 22 inches 16 inch wheels for a child s inseam of 22 25 inches 20 inch wheels 9 x research source adjust the seat height to fit your legs before testing a bike frame the height of the seat is easily modified on a bike to fit you and the right size frame will feel wrong if the seat isn t high enough you want to have it raised so that on the bottom of your pedal stroke one foot is at the lowest point your knee is slightly bent not straight have a friend or someone at the bike shop hold the bike in place while you get on pedal backward stopping with one foot at the very bottom of the pedal s rotation and adjust your seat height so that it is slightly bent it is very rare that the last person who tested the bike needed the same seat height as you so you must adjust this before knowing if the frame is the wrong size make sure you are not shifting or dropping your hips with each pedal stroke as this will make your foot drop lower than it should and result in an improper fit 10 x research source find the reach that is most comfortable for you there are a lot of measurements out there for finding the proper length between your seat and the handlebars but they all end with the same advice pick one that you re comfortable with at the end of the day you ll feel like the reach to the handlebars is right if you can touch every shifter and brakes comfortably your elbows are slightly bent you can bend from the waist not the back to reach down in general casual riders will want closer higher handlebars while racers want a longer reach 11 x research source do a stand over test to see if the bike fits you properly straddle the top tube of the bike with your feet shoulder width apart grab the stem that connects to the handlebars with one hand and the seat with the other hand pull the frame up against your pelvic bone have a friend measure the distance between the ground and the wheels 12 x research source a road bike should only have 1 2 in 2 5 5 1 cm of space between the wheels and ground if not then you need a bigger frame a mountain bike should have 3 4 in 7 6 10 2 cm of space beneath the tires if it s any more or less change the frame size test out your suggested frame size before buying everyone s body is a little different and the proportions of your arms legs and torso might mean you need a different frame to feel comfortable use your inseam measurements to get a starting frame size then go to a local bike shop and test it out then test out a size bigger and size smaller if you are in between sizes that both feel comfortable think about your riding style smaller bikes are generally lighter and a bit more maneuverable however this difference is negligible and you might not be able to adjust the bike a size if you find yourself uncomfortable later on many mountain bikers and racers opt for the smaller frame larger bikes can make you reach a bit too far but you can often raise and lower the handlebars to a greater degree allowing you better customization options if you decide you need a better fit further down the road many road bikers chose the larger bike for a more comfortable fit use an online sizing guide if you cannot test out bikes while they are far from perfect since they cannot possibly account for your unique body type sizing guides are useful nonetheless for sizing a frame you can find them online with a quick internet search for mountain road kids bmx etc frame sizing guide most of them require you to input your height and inseam as well as your riding style they then give you a range of frames to try out 13 x research source visit a bike shop for a professional sizing session most bicycle stores will help you determine the best size for your comfort and needs they will take measurements for you and let you test out different types of bikes if you don t want to size your bike yourself this is a quick and easy option remember that your comfort comes first everyone is different so if you don t feel comfortable riding a bike the should fit you you need to get it re sized test a few different frame sizes before buying and feel free to play with the seat and handlebars until you find your sweet spot rent a few bikes before buying so that you can get 2 3 days of riding in talk to you local bike staff even if you might buy a bike online let them know about any specific issues you ve had and possible reasons 14 x research source know that you must adjust the seat and handlebars to truly size a bike getting the right frame size is only one part of sizing a bike correctly think of sizing measurements as your first draft it is the basis for everything that follows but you need to make finer adjustments to get everything right make minor adjustments to your seat height if you feel knee pain while you should set your seat before you buy a bike making finer adjustments is crucial to comfortable sizing remember to pedal with the balls of your feet and don t swing your hips up and down with each stroke if you feel pain in the back of your knee when riding your seat is too high lower it 1 2cm if you feel pain in the front of your knee when riding your seat is too low raise it 1 2cm 15 x research source adjust how far forward the seat is to change your distance to the handlebars loosen the bolt underneath the back of the seat to move the seat forward or backward several centimeters make sure the seat is far enough forward for you for you to reach the handlebars comfortably 16 x research source if your seat is in the right position you will be able to stand on the pedals without using the handlebars to pull you up if you have trouble standing reaching for the bars or feel finger numbness then your seat is too far back trouble riding down hills and or shoulder pain usually means your seat is too far forward 17 x research source start with your seat angle leveled evenly with the ground use a carpenter s level to make sure the seat is flat as this ensures even distribution of your weight while some people believe a seat should be tilted up a level seat is almost always the best starting point however if you experience crotch discomfort you can try women typically tilt the seat down for comfort men typically tilt the seat up for comfort 18 x research source loosen the bolt on the side of the seat to change the seat angle you can easily loosen the bolt change the angle then tighten again some older seats have two small bolts underneath the seat one in front of the seat post and one behind you must tighten one side to push that side up while loosening the other almost like a see saw 19 x research source adjust your handlebars to ride comfortably you want to ride in a way that s comfortable for you and that changes from person to person you want to feel in control of the bike without lower back pain most beginner riders want the handlebars to be even with saddle or 1 2 lower for racers and mountain bikers your elbows should be slightly bent and your fingers light on the handlebars they could freely play the piano if there was one there the position of your handlebars is determined by four things top tube length refers to the length of the bar between your handlebar stem and seat post these are adjusted to fit the frame and unless you have a very disproportionate body torso much larger smaller than legs getting a properly sized frame will give you a properly sized top tube stem length is the distance between your top tube and the handlebars the longer the stem the further away the bars will be from your seat stems run from 15 150 and are the primary way to adjust your frame to make it fit your torso longer stems bend you into a more aerodynamic position while shorter stems lead to a more upright calmer riding style 20 x research source handlebar angle can be changed independently from your stem to do so loosen the 4 bolts where the stem meets the handlebars and angle it up or down to your comfort this is a great way to get an extra 1 3 inches on your handlebar position which can make a big difference in comfort 21 x research source handlebar height may often be changed by adding or removing the metal spacers where your stem meets your frame to do so loosen the bolt on the top of the stem and the two that clamp the stem to your frame and remove the handlebars then add or remove the spacers accordingly you can only make minor changes however as there is not a lot of room for new spacers some older road bikes with quill or threaded stems may allow you to adjust the handlebar height by raising or lowering the stem,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to make your powerwheels faster,power wheels cars are fun toys for your little ones but if they want add just a bit more pep or have grown out of the slow pace adding a new motor or battery can be the solution aftermarket batteries are cost effective and electric motors are very common as they are found inside radio controlled toys both options provide a quality upgrade to your power wheels car,open the motor of your power wheels car flip your car upside down and remove the wheels to access the black motor hardware remove the motor by loosening the screws using the proper screwdriver and wiggling the cylinder shaped motor until it comes free 1 x research source check the compatibility of your power wheels motor ensure that the new motor that you have chosen is the correct size for your power wheels remove the brushless motor from your secondary car it will be cylinder shaped and you may need to remove some hardware to expose the motor wipe the motor clean with a dry rag to remove any buildup of dirt 2 x research source insert a solder free spade connector to the pin of the brushless motor you may be able to salvage the spade off of the power wheels motor by heating it gently and applying some pressure with a flathead screwdriver 3 x research source if you can t remove it purchase an inexpensive spade from your local hardware store rather than potentially ruining the already connected spade and the actual motor itself insert the brushless motor back into the power wheels hardware gently push the motor in spade end first 4 x research source using your screwdriver put the screws back into the hardware to hold the battery in place the brushless motor may need some twisting and turning until it is solidly inserted so be patient and don t try to force it attach the wires to the brushless motor carefully unwrap the wires from the original motor and re attach them to the brushless motor following the same connecting points at this point a new battery could also be inserted if desired disconnect the battery to avoid getting shocked thread the wheels back onto your power wheels car and test your car should be compatible with the remote from the brushless motor keep the car upside down as you test to be cautious as the speed will be greatly increased choose an aftermarket battery when choosing a battery look for information on your power wheels battery to guide you on the exact specifications you must note the voltage chemistry and size for example fisherbrand power wheels batteries are often lead based 12 volt and are 16 0 x 11 0 x 8

how to build an airplane,for some people building and flying your own plane is a satisfying personal experience constructing your own plane is legal in most countries and you don t need to know any skills to begin you can start by purchasing a kit online and getting involved with aviation organizations once you re done building register your plane with your government s aviation board then you can enjoy cruising the skies in a plane customized to your liking this article is for building full scale aircraft to build a model airplane check out some different wikihow articles,check your area regulations on building your own airplane in many countries building your own aircraft is legal you typically do not need to have a pilot s license until you are ready to fly the plane all you have to do is buy supplies and get to work 1 x research source in the u s for example the federal aviation administration regulates aircraft be aware of any building rules for instance the faa requires you to construct 51 of your plane yourself prove this by making a logbook containing photos and videos of your work 2 x research source find a place to build your plane many builders choose their garage basement or another home workspace keep in mind that you will need a lot of space to store an airplane and its parts it also helps to stay indoors where the temperature can be kept above 50 f 10 c since bad weather makes working tough when choosing a workspace consider how long the build will take you with consistent work the process can be as short as a few months but it takes most builders years some kit companies allow you to build inside their facility this can be a good option if you live nearby choose what you want your plane to be made from your plane can be made from wood and fabric aluminum or composite materials each material has different price points and advantages so research these before settling on a plane kit or design also consider your skills such as metalworking woodworking and sewing since this can make some material easier to use than others wood and fabric combination frames are light but weak early planes used wood and it is still a user friendly option for custom planes most planes today are made out of aluminum an inexpensive material that is more aerodynamic than wood composite materials are stronger and more aerodynamic than aluminum but also more expensive purchase a building kit online a basic building kit can cost you between 6 500 and 15 000 usd these kits provide all the plans and materials you need to build the external structure of your plane so they save you time you can find all sorts of different plane models by shopping with different kit manufacturers 3 x research source kits typically do not come with an engine propeller and flight control panel so you will have to buy these separately if you want to save money you can search online for airplane plans you can download available plans buy plans from kit companies or design your own to design your own plans use a program like airplane pdq to create the design then a flight simulator like x plane to test it assemble your plane s frame use the instructions in your kit or your plans to construct the plane concentrate on constructing 1 piece at a time usually you will start with the tail build towards the nose and attach the wings last work piece by piece until the frame is complete the skills and tools you need for this depend on your kit and the material you are working with you do not need to have technical expertise to begin you can learn or refine skills as you go through the building process a few skills that may come in handy are riveting and welding install the engine in the nose of the plane position the engine at the front of the plane behind where the flight control panel will be installed later the engine can be heavy so you may need some help lifting it mount it in place using a wrench and sockets 4 x research source you can order an engine from kit manufacturers and online auction sites you may also be able to repurpose engines from old cars and junkyards the engine can cost as much as your kit expect it to be ⅓ of your total costs at least 2 000 usd installing the engine can be tricky if you get stuck look for online guides and videos connect the propeller to the front of the engine push the propeller s shaft through the plane s nose connecting it with the engine keep the blades on the outside of the plane secure the propeller to the engine and plane by using a socket wrench to tighten bolts holding it in place 5 x research source if your kit does not come with a propeller you can purchase 1 online from kit pr aviation manufacturers if you are using a car engine get a propeller speed reduction unit and attach it to the engine first otherwise the propeller will spin too quickly for the plane to fly properly place the flight panel inside the plane the aviation panel should fit in front of the plane s nose you may need to do some electrical wiring to connect the panel to the engine the panel itself can be set in place with rivets the panel has instruments such as temperature gauges and a radio so make sure they work before you move on 6 x research source order a flight panel online from an aviation company or an auction site expect to pay about 1 000 usd some modern avionics panels come with a control module you plug the panel components into the module for easier installation furnish the interior of your plane your interior design depends on your plane a lot of planes don t have much space in the interior but you will at least need a comfortable seat if it wasn t included in your kit you can order 1 online or make your own most home built planes are designed for 1 or 2 people you may not be allowed to carry more than 4 people at a time some helpful skills for this can include riveting and sewing paint your plane the color you want search online to order specially designed aircraft paints in the color you want planning out a color scheme can help lay down a drop cloth and use painter s tape to protect areas you don t want to color apply the paint using a spray gun and use a brush to reach smaller areas apply a primer first so the paint sticks to the aircraft better after the paint dries spray on a finishing material such as acetone to protect your craft be sure to work in a ventilated area wear a respirator and eye goggles get a pilot s license in your free time a pilot s license is necessary before you can take flight while you can wait until you finish your build to do this you can begin the process before you even start on your plane take a flight class from a certified school in your area then apply with the faa or your government s aerial authority 7 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source you won t be able to use your plane for this since it has to pass inspections first you will use an instructional plane at the school the certification board gives you a medical exam similar to going to a doctor for a check up they may also have you take a written test on flight rules use your pilot s license to test out many different types of aircraft this can help you figure out what kind of plane you want to build bring your plane to an airport you will need to transport your plane to an airport before you can fly it if you can detach parts like the wings and reassemble the plane in an airport hangar transport the plane by renting a truck or flatbed make sure all the parts are strapped down securely 8 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source contact airports in your region the employees can direct you on where to bring your plane for registration find a place to store your plane many planes are stored at hangars near the airport you will have to pay a fee which may be around 700 to 800 annually for a small plane however your plane will be safe in the hangar and always accessible 9 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source contact your local airport for information on renting hangar space if you have a lot of property space or storage space like a large barn you may keep the plane there complete your aircraft registration paperwork your government s transportation safety board such as the federal aviation administration in the u s handles aircraft registration complete the paperwork to register your aircraft as amateur built they will likely give you an identification number for your plane 10 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source registration can take 1 to 2 months to complete so be prepared for this while you wait consider practicing by flying other airplanes contact the eaa or other flying organizations for help with the paperwork complete the final plane inspection at the airport a government agent at the airport will give your plane a thorough inspection to make sure it is safe they check that your plane is built properly with quality materials if your plane passes you receive a document of official certification in 1 to 2 months 11 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source if your government requires you to keep a logbook detailing the building process bring it in during the inspection have your first test flight schedule the test with the government agency that certified your plane the eaa and other flight organizations can help you with this to pass the test you have to fly your plane for up to 40 hours total you can do this within a couple of sessions 12 x research source once you pass the test you can fly your plane according to the rules of the sky you can fly cross country and invite other people aboard have an inspector verify your work the eaa for example provides free inspections while you build your plane it s a good idea to have them come out several times during the building process these inspections are meant to identify any issues with your work and building material that can prevent your plane from passing an official inspection eaa inspectors are fellow builders volunteering their time the inspections are free find inspectors in your area at https www eaa org techcounselors attend amateur aircraft groups and events visit events hosted by groups such as the experimental aircraft association eaa the eaa hosts events such as the air venture in oshkosh wisconsin these are places to network with kit manufacturers and fellow builders learn valuable

how to open a car dealership,nearly everyone uses a car for business or personal use if you use a car you also need repair and maintenance on your vehicle as a result consumers need to seek out car dealers to buy cars and get them serviced the cost of opening and operating a dealership however can require millions of dollars before you open a car dealership think carefully through the entire process,perform market research the first step in any business venture is to determine if there is a demand for your product or service once you determine the demand you need to consider how your company might attract some of that customer demand 1 x research source determine the number of cars sold in your area assume for example that the typical car buyer is willing to visit a dealership within 10 miles 16 1 km of their home try to determine the number of cars sold within a 10 mile radius of your proposed car dealership assume that 50 000 cars are sold in that area each year once you know the total number of cars research those purchases by category for example how many cars are purchased compared to trucks what percentage of the cars sold are new and how many are used you may even be able to determine the number of cars by model honda ford etc assess the existing car dealers in the market say for example that 3 000 new hondas are sold in your area each year you re considering a honda dealership how many existing honda dealers are in your area of the hondas sold how many were purchased by consumers who went online and bought a new car from a dealership located out of town this analysis will help you determine if there is a need for a new dealership in your market determine your ideal customer every business needs to identify their ideal customer your ideal customer is a summary of the traits that your best customers have in common when you identify the ideal customer you can design your business to meet their needs 2 x research source look at the age gender occupation and income level of the customers you are trying to attract assume that you want to open a honda dealership do some research to determine the type of people who buy a honda you may find that the ideal honda customer is a male between the ages of 27 and 50 years old that customer is a white collar professional with an above average level of income the honda customer has owned a honda previously or has a family member who owns a honda many car dealers build relationships with customers by selling cars and providing a service department some customers go back to the car dealer to get service on their vehicle find out where the ideal honda customer gets their car serviced do they go to their dealership or to their local repair shop this information can help you create a service department that will attract customers calculate the size of your market the goal of your dealership market research is to determine if there is sufficient demand for your product ultimately you need to know the dollar amount of sales for your product and estimate how much of that customer demand you can attract 3 x research source assume that 3 000 new hondas are sold in your area each year you re also considering selling used hondas which generate 2 000 in sales each year the size of your market is 5 000 hondas based on your research of existing car dealers and customer demand you believe that your new dealership can attract 20 of the existing honda car market that 20 figure would mean 5 000 new and used car sales multiplied by 20 1 000 car sales assume that the average profit per car considering both new and used is 500 if your dealership sold 1 000 cars the business would generate 1 000 cars x 500 500 000 in profit in addition you estimate that your service department would create a 300 000 profit the total profit for your dealership would total 800 000 consider opening a franchise for your business nearly all of the larger car dealerships are franchises in this arrangement you are the franchisee who pays a fee to the franchisor you also sign a franchise agreement to operate your business 4 x research source to open your honda dealership you would need to complete a long process to become a franchisee honda would require you to provide extensive financial disclosures to determine if you have the financial means to open and operate a honda dealership the franchisor honda grants you the right to use the honda logo and other marketing tools to operate a franchise you will participate in local advertising and promotion of honda cars the franchisor will also agree on a process to supply your dealership with honda cars if you enter into an agreement with a popular car brand it gives your car dealership credibility in the marketplace that credibility can help you generate sales however the franchise agreement includes many restrictions on how you can advertise and sell their cars to comply with the franchise agreement you need to follow the requirements decide on selling new cars used cars or both if you sell both new and used cars you have the opportunity to serve two types of consumers selling to both markets however will require a larger investment of time and money 5 x research source if you sell used cars you will attract customers who want to spend less money on a vehicle instead of buying the 25 000 new car for example they may buy a 15 000 used car used cars typically require more service and maintenance as you sell more used cars you may be able to grow your service business a growing number of customers shop for cars online when a customer enters your dealership they may have checked 4 or 5 dealerships to price a particular car you may find heavy competition for new car sales in particular in order to drive total car sales you may need a used car sales department assess the need for a service department everyone needs to get his or her car serviced eventually operating a service department is a great way to build a relationship with a car owner you can develop relationships with customers who bought their vehicle somewhere else if you do a great job on their car they may buy their next car from you the need for service on your car can be stressful it s inconvenient to be without a car while it is being repaired your great customer service can help reduce that anxiety after you service someone s car stay in touch with the customer promote your car sales and service through emails and mailers your efforts will increase your chances of selling the customer a car in the future add up the costs needed to start your car dealership the typical car dealership may require millions of dollars to open and operate your biggest cost will be your inventory of cars floorplan refers to the cost of the vehicles you have on your car lot in addition to the cost of your floorplan you ll need to buy or lease property you ll build or renovate buildings on the property for your showroom and possibly for a repair department if you operate a franchise you will pay the car company an initial franchise fee once you re operating you ll pay annual fees for your franchise agreement car dealers also have to constantly train employees on new car features so that they can explain those features to customers you incur large costs for training decide on how you will finance the cost of your dealership financing your dealership is a huge commitment you ll need to think carefully about how you will find the money to open your dealership 6 x research source most car dealerships finance their floorplan through a bank the cars on the lot serve as collateral for the floorplan loan a dealership may also incur huge costs to design and build its showroom and repair center in addition to car inventory you may need to hire dozens of employees you ll need cash to meet payroll each month if you borrow money you ll need to provide sufficient collateral for your loan you may need to pledge personal assets as collateral to obtain your loan the bank will also need to see detailed financial projections these projections will explain how your business will generate a profit and repay the bank loan consider the regulatory requirement to start and operate your dealership your state county or city will have requirements to operate your dealership many of these rules are set up to protect the consumers who are making a large investment in buying a car 7 x research source your state will require you to obtain a license to sell cars as your primary business while individuals can sell cars to each other a car dealer who sells many cars a year will need a license to operate to build your dealership you will need to get building permits from your city or county your state will require you to have several forms of insurance to operate your dealership one type of required insurance is a surety bond this bond is put in place to protect the car buyer from any fraud related to a car purchase,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to survive a plane crash,the chances of dying on a commercial airline flight are actually as low as 9 million to 1 that said a lot can go wrong at 33 000 feet 10 058 4 m above the ground and if you re unlucky enough to be aboard when something does the decisions you make could mean the difference between life and death almost 95 of airplane crashes have survivors so even if the worst does happen your odds aren t as bad as you might think you can learn to prepare for each flight safety stay calm during the crash itself and survive the aftermath,dress comfortably you ll need to be able to stay warm if you survive a crash even if that is not a consideration the more of your body is covered during impact the less likely you are to receive serious injuries or burns wear long pants a long sleeve t shirt and sturdy comfortable lace up shoes 1 x research source loose or elaborate clothing poses a risk as it can get snagged on obstacles in the close confines of a plane if you know you re going to be flying over cold areas dress appropriately and consider keeping a jacket on your lap cotton or wool clothing is also preferable as it is less flammable wool is preferable to cotton when flying over water as wool does not lose its insulating properties to the degree cotton does when wet wear sensible shoes although you may want to be comfortable or professional looking on a flight sandals or high heels make it hard to move quickly should there be an emergency high heels are not allowed on the evacuation slides and you can cut your feet and toes on glass or get flammable liquids on or in your sandals if you wear them 2 x research source sit in the tail of the aircraft passengers in the tail of the aircraft have 40 higher survival rates than those in the first few rows in the event of a crash because a quick escape gives you the best chance for survival it s best to get seats as close as possible to an exit on the aisle and in the back of the plane 3 x research source yes it s actually statistically safer to fly economy than first class save money and stay safer read the safety card and listen to the pre flight safety speech yes you may have heard it all before and you ll probably never need it but if you keep your headphones on during the pre flight instructions or ignore the safety card you ll be missing out on information that could be vital in the event of a crash don t assume you know it all already either every type of airplane has different safety instructions 4 x research source if you re sitting in an exit row study the door and make sure you know how to open it if you need to in normal circumstances the flight attendant will open the door but if they are dead or injured you ll need to do it count the number of seats between your seat and the exit row find the exit closest to you and count the number of seats that it ll take to get to it if the plane crashes it could be smoky loud or confusing in the cabin afterward if you need to escape you might have to feel your way to the exit which will be a lot easier if you know where it is and how far you might even write down the number in pen on your hand so you ll have a quick reference if you need to keep your seat belt on at all times every centimeter of slack in your seat belt triples the g force you ll experience in the crash so keep your seat belt properly tightened at all times you re on the aircraft push the belt down as low over your pelvis as possible you should be able to feel the upper ridge of the pelvis above the upper edge of the belt which helps to brace you in an emergency much better than your soft stomach leave your belt on even if you re sleeping if something happens while you re out you ll be glad to have the restraints in place assess the situation try to determine what surface the plane will land on so you can customize your preparations if you re going to be landing in water for example you ll want to put your life vest on though you need to wait to inflate it until you re out of the plane if you re going to be landing in cold weather you should try to get a blanket or jacket to keep you warm once outside plot out the general course you ll be on ahead of time so you ll have some idea of where you are when the plane crashes if you re flying from iowa to california you can be fairly certain you won t be landing in the ocean use the time before the crash to find your exit if the plane is going to crash you almost always have several minutes to prepare before impact use this time to once again review where the exits are prepare your space as much as possible if you know you re going to crash return your seat back to its full upright position and stow away any loose items that could become hazardous if at all possible zip up your jacket and make sure your shoes are tied tightly to your feet then assume one of two standard brace positions used for surviving a plane crash and try to remain calm 5 x research source in either position your feet should be flat on the floor and further back than your knees to reduce injuries to your feet and legs which you will need in order to successfully exit the craft after impact place your legs as far under the seat as possible to avoid breaking your shin bones brace yourself against the seat in front of you if the seat in front of you is close enough to reach place one hand palm down on the back of that seat then cross the other hand palm down over the first hand rest your forehead against your hands keep your fingers unlaced it s also sometimes recommended that you put your head directly against the seat in front of you and lace your fingers behind your head tucking your upper arms against the sides of your head to cradle it bend forward if there s no seat in front of you if you don t have a seat close in front of you bend forward and put your chest on your thighs and your head between your knees cross your wrists in front of your lower calves and grab your ankles try and remain calm it can be easy to get swept up in the pandemonium immediately preceding and following a crash keep a cool head though and you re more likely to get out alive remember that even in the worst wrecks you do have a chance of survival you ll need to be able to think methodically and rationally to maximize that chance put on your life jacket but do not inflate it in the case of a crash in water if you inflate it in the plane when it starts to fill up with water the life jacket will force you upwards against the cabin roof and it will be very hard to swim back down leaving you trapped instead hold your breath and swim out once you re out inflate it 6 x research source put your oxygen mask on before assisting others you ve probably heard this on every commercial flight you ve been on but it s worth repeating if the integrity of the cabin is compromised you have only about 15 seconds or less to start breathing through your oxygen mask before you are rendered unconscious 7 x research source while you may feel an impulse to first help your children or the elderly passenger sitting next to you you ll be no good to anyone if you don t remain conscious also remember that you can put somebody else s oxygen mask on even if they re unconscious this might help save their life protect yourself from smoke fire and smoke are responsible for the largest percentage of crash fatalities the smoke in an airplane fire can be very thick and highly toxic so cover your nose and mouth with a cloth to avoid breathing it in if possible moisten the cloth to provide extra protection 8 x research source stay low as you escape to duck under the level of smoke it might not seem like a big deal but passing out due to smoke inhalation is one of the most dangerous things that can happen during this critical period get out of the airplane as quickly as possible according to the national transportation safety board ntsb 68 percent of plane crash deaths are due to post crash fire not injuries sustained in the crash itself 9 x research source it s critical to get out of the aircraft without delay if fire or smoke is present you will generally have less than two minutes to safely exit the plane make sure the exit you choose is safe look through the window to determine if there is fire or some other hazard outside of an exit if there is try the exit across the plane or proceed to another set of exits listen to the flight attendants post crash instructions flight attendants undergo rigorous training to make sure they know what to do in the event of a crash if a flight attendant is able to instruct or assist you listen closely and cooperate to increase everyone s chances of survival ditch your stuff don t try to rescue your belongings it s common sense but still some people don t seem to get it leave everything behind rescuing your belongings will only slow you down 10 x research source if you end up needing to salvage supplies from the plane crash site worry about that later right now you need to make sure that you get clear of the wreckage and find some safe cover get out now get at least 500 feet 152 4 m upwind from the wreckage if you re stranded in a remote area the best thing to do usually is to stay close to the aircraft to await rescuers you don t want to be too close though fire or explosion can happen at any time after a crash so put some distance between you and the plane if the crash is in open water swim as far away from the plane wreckage as possible 11 x research source stay in one place but pay attention to what needs to happen while it s essential to stay calm after a crash you also need to recognize when you need to act and do so swiftly help out people who are struggling and tend to people s wounds using basic first aid available attend to your own wounds if at all possible check yourself for cuts and other abrasions and apply pressure if necessary stay in one place to reduce the chance of exacerbating internal injuries negative panic is a strange inability to react assertively and appropriately to the situation for example a person may just remain in his or her seat instead of heading toward the exit watch out for this in your fellow passengers or traveling companions 12 x research source call emergency services and wait for rescue you stand a much higher chance of surviving if you just stay put don t wander off and look for help or try to find something close by if your plane went down there will be people on the way quickly and you want to be there when they arrive just stay put,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to shift a semi truck,learning to drive a semi truck properly requires lots of training and experience but if you re curious about the basics of shifting one you can get a primer on the steps that you ll need to practice if you want to drive the big rigs learn how the gear shifter workers how to shift between gears and some tips for knowing when to shift,understand how the gear shift differs from a normal vehicle s shifter if you re familiar with a manual transmission the basic principles of the eaton fuller transmission shifter the style used in many commercial trucks today is similar but more complex basically it s oriented like a five speed but with a total of four different ratios at each position which you toggle by a combination of switches and positions this results in a total combination of 18 different speeds 1 x research source the shift knob has two switches controlling air actuated gears one is the range switch which needs to be set on low for gears lo 4 and the other is the high low splitter which is used to toggle between the low and high setting at each gear your index finger operates the range switch which allows you to flip between high and low at each gear position with your thumb learn the gear shift pattern most gear shifts have a diagram displaying the shifting pattern which will help to clue you into the organization of the gears 2 x research source the low gears are usually differentiated from the high gears by color and reverse is indicated by an r gears 1 4 should all be straightforward but then to shift into fifth gear you shift back to the first position and the pattern repeats first gear is in the same position as fifth second in the same as sixth and so on remember at each position you also have a total of four different speeds though only two will be accessible depending on where you shift from in first gear you ve got 1l and 1h as well as 5l and 5h practice the gear pattern of the semi while the truck is stopped this allows you to become familiar with the gear pattern so you can shift up and down without looking this will help you keep your eyes safely on the road while driving grip the gear shift so that your index finger is available to work the range switch and the middle and thumb can work the high low splitter if you don t have experience operating the clutch and driving a manual transmission vehicle shifting a semi truck is going to have a much larger learning curve operating the gear shifter by itself is challenging enough so you need to be very comfortable operating the clutch on a regular vehicle before you attempt to drive a semi practice on a regular car start the truck hold the clutch pedal to the floor as you would to start a normal manual transmission vehicle this stops the transmission gears from turning which allows the shifter to slide into gear select lol by moving the shifter into the lo gear position usually left and back 3 x research source check to make sure the range switch is in the low position down and the splitter is also on l and you ll be ready to start the vehicle push down the accelerator and slowly release the clutch as you might guess when the vehicle s got 18 different speeds getting the truck into lo gear on low setting will get you going about one mile per hour if that once you ve slid into it release the clutch and you ll probably be ready to shift into lo h to shift into lo h you ll change the splitter to high gear to shift into high you need to depress the clutch slightly but not all the way to floor then let it out to shift into lo h double clutch to shift into first gear low setting depress the clutch again slightly not to the floor when the rpms reach first gear range and switch the splitter back to l then pull the gear shift into the neutral position and release the clutch depress the clutch again all the way and push the gear shift into first as you release the clutch this is called double clutching and it s necessary because you can t split between low and high on the splitter while you re in neutral meaning that you have to toggle from h back to l then shift into neutral then operate the clutch again to get it into first it s a lot of work 4 x research source continue this pattern through the first half of the gears after you shift into 1 l you can flip the high low switch up into the high position continuing to accelerate and continuing this basic pattern through the upper gears repeat the previous steps through 1 h 2 l 2 h 3 l 3 h 4 l and 4 h to make the half steps continue pushing the splitter button releasing the accelerator pushing in and releasing the clutch switch over to fifth gear when you re ready with the splitter switch in l flip up the range selector to 5 h which will allow you to avoid grinding gears when you switch back into the first position this is absolutely essential switch the range then double clutch shift back to where 1 was before and it will be fifth gear 5 x research source continue shifting through the higher gears the basic principles now repeats itself continue shifting and toggling between l and h shifting up through 5 h 6 l 6 h 7 l 7 h 8 l and finally 8 h use the color indicators on the tachometer most rpm gauges should be color coded with 1500 rpms at about the top 12 o clock of the gauge which is typically colored green this is the ideal place to shift between gears 1700 2100 is typically beyond the point where you should be shifting with the exception of going downhill this region is typically colored yellow with anything above colored red if you re less than 1200 rpm and try to shift the engine is likely to splutter and possibly stall 6 x research source get used to the general shifting conditions after a while you ll be able to familiarize yourself with the general positions that you need to shift but in instruction school you learn a few basic rules of thumb be in top gear at 50 mph 80 5 km h or greater generally speaking if you re traveling at highway speeds or greater you should be at top gear always be in fifth or sixth gear for sharp turns in city conditions to avoid stalling it s good to be switched over into the upper gears other general speed guidelines will vary from transmission to transmission for different trucks you ll need to ask your instructor or other experienced drivers for tips downshift whenever you re slowing down to downshift you need to slow down to the rolling speed by hitting the brake then select the gear for that range typically you need to rev up to 1400 1600rpm then slip the transmission into the proper gear for that speed range 7 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to make a car backfire,the term backfiring describes any instance where car fuel is combusting somewhere other than the combustion engine while this is usually something you ll want to avoid an explosion in the exhaust or air intake systems will have a pretty impressive effect with your car roaring with flames and smoke strutting out its back you ll be able to get your car looking like a drag racing monster keep in mind that backfiring a car can be very dangerous so it s generally inadvisable unless you really know what you re doing,consider the reasons that cars backfire while backfiring can be done manually with relative ease in old cars it s important you have an understanding of what backfiring is and what causes it a misplaced spark or unexpected burst of fuel or air will cause a loud burst from the engine while modern cars come equipped with systems to regulate these aspects via an engine control unit ecu older cars roughly before 1990 are far more malleable 1 x research source it s important to keep in mind the reasons why regulating systems were installed in the first place excessive backfiring is very unhealthy for your vehicle and can ultimately result in having to replace parts start your vehicle bring it to a steady rev prepare the vehicle as you regularly would normal safety checks including dripping oil are much more important here as you ll be charging an open flame the location in which you do this must be open and relatively free of things that might get caught by the flame this includes anyone who may be watching keep that at a healthy distance around 10 meters 33 ft should be good turn the engine off again with your foot on the gas pedal this will prep your car for some backfiring ideally you don t want to start moving fast while you re turning on the engine so keep the pressure light wait a few seconds then restart the car keep your foot on the gas pedal as it starts up once it s up press the accelerator down as hard as you can this should cause the car to backfire 2 x research source be aware that your car may already backfire some modern sports cars actually backfire intentionally when it comes time to decelerate this is mostly done to add to the car s presence and bravado considering it is much more difficult to properly backfire a more recent model you might want to exploit the existing opportunities try decelerating after hitting a decent 60mph speed and see if you can hear it better still get a friend to watch the exhaust as you drive and decelerate 3 x research source equip your vehicle accordingly modern cars roughly after 1990 require more tweaking before they can backfire safely because the ecu is there as a failsafe against backfiring the chassis of the car isn t designed to normally withstand it a sturdier exhaust port such as the tomei type 80 will minimize damage to the car s body install a new ecu input depending on the model of car there should be a port with a flash tune kit or something along the lines of it hooked up to your car you ll be able to modify the ecu software directly changing or modding the ecu software will change the times and rates in which fuel is injected unfortunately ecu modding hardware and software is fairly expensive and might put you back over 1000 dollars 4 x research source keep in mind ecu mods are often specific to certain models so you might have to do some searching before you find one that suits yours access and change the injection rates in the ecu this is where it comes tricky as it requires you have an existing knowledge of your vehicle s specifications you want to figure out what engine rpm you want for your car to start backfiring if you just want the roar and pop of a backfire choose an rpm to cut all fuel input a higher number for a given rpm if you want the flames it goes without saying that adding extra fuel is more dangerous if you re relatively new to this it s recommended you experiment with the safer route first although the particulars will vary depending on the model of car and type of ecu kit generally speaking you will want to access the input and cut fuel intake at the rpm you d like your car to pop at if you re using a flash tune kit for example input the given rpm intake as the most negative integer the system will accept input these negative integers e g 15 etc to encompass the range of a couple hundred rpms this will essentially trick your engine into popping entering a number incorrectly could inadvertently destroy your car it is not recommended you even consider doing this without some expertise in motorworks,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to choose a bicycle,there many different types of bicycles and many different types of people with different biking needs some people like tricks some like races and some like speed control you will need to take into account your own preferences when choosing the right bicycle for yourself to figure out how to choose which type of bike is best for you ask yourself where and how often you plan to ride what you will use your bike for and how much you are willing to invest,learn how to ride if you don t already know that s the first and most important step you can do this on practically any bike that is the right size for you starting on a basic single speed bike with coaster brakes is usually best since you don t have to worry about shifting gears and front rear braking sequences these bikes offer an easy learning curve learn about the basic types of bikes there are many different types of bikes that offer a wide range of capabilities if you live in a city you probably want a bike that s built for roads if you live somewhere where you can bike on trails then a mountain bike might be more your speed 1 x research source standard bikes these are old fashioned single speed bikes with coaster brakes pedal backward to brake good for leisurely riding around town if there are no serious hills or other obstacles bmx bikes low profile bikes with 20 inch 50 8 cm usually knobby tires these are for competition biking on trails or courses and have cable operated caliper brakes on the front and rear these bikes are single geared bikes road bikes this is a general term for traditional looking and racing like bicycles designed for good performance on pavement there is a wide range of options within this category road bikes can often be classified into two broad groups of racing performance or touring racing bikes are designed for pure speed with an emphasis on light weight and place the rider in an aggressive posture touring bikes are designed for sustained comfort and carrying loads they have heavier components for durability mounts for rack and fender attachments and have a more upright riding position road bikes traditionally have drop or aero handlebars these handlebars allow the rider a range of hand placements for comfort or for achieving an aerodynamic riding position mountain bikes bikes designed for off road use with compact frames stable handling clearance for wide and knobby tires and higher handlebars for a more upright position for hilly terrain these bikes will generally come with low range gearing there are many types designed for specific purposes such as downhill versus cross country racing mountain bikes can be equipped with sophisticated suspension and disc brake systems mountain bikes are also very popular as all around bicycles due to versatility tandem bikes these bikes have an extra seat and set of pedals for two people to ride together recumbent bikes these bicycles seat the rider in a reclining position with the pedals positioned forward which is a more natural position requiring less flexibility than upright bikes these bikes can be fitted with windshields for good aerodynamic performance however these are generally heavier and can t match the performance of upright racing style bikes think about your intended usage if you intend to ride your bike on trails and unpaved roads a mountain bike is a good fit if you don t intend to ride on unpaved trails and live in a city a road bike will be more efficient racing style bikes will not be as comfortable or practical for casual riders depending on where you live shops may be limited to mostly racing and mountain bikes a popular middle ground that you may find is the hybrid style bike hybrid bikes often mix elements of both road and mountain bikes hybrid bikes typically have thicker wheels and a wider seat frames are usually fairly light and most use caliper hand brakes 2 x research source when deciding on a bike that will work for you ask yourself a few questions to get started what will your average riding time be how often will you use your bike are you getting a bike for fun or more for transportation what have you ridden in the past being able to answer these basic questions will give you a good picture of what kinds of features you need in a bike if you plan to ride your bike to work every day you probably want more of a road bike that is fast and light if you want a bike you can attach extra components to like a basket and ride around a hybrid or cruiser might work and if you plan on exercising and riding trails then a mountain bike is what you re looking for decide between quality and price bicycles will vary in price depending on what type you re looking at where you re looking and the quality of materials road bikes will be better for commuting and speed but can get expensive depending on the quality of materials cruiser or hybrid bikes sometimes offer more room to add accessories like baskets and saddle bags 3 x research source if you intend to mount a basket saddlebags or a baby seat you will want to be sure the frame is compatible with these devices many bike shops have complete assemblies with these attachments already mounted if you plan on attaching a lot of accessories avoid bikes from big box stores these bikes while less expensive don t typically offer suitable construction for attachments because the materials aren t as good adding too much weight can cause your bike to break down or not perform think about how long and how often you plan on having and using your bike if you are planning to commute to work most days invest in a higher quality bike while more expensive higher quality bikes will last longer and are constructed with durable lightweight materials that will make performance better and last longer know what types of terrain you ll be biking on road and mountain bikes usually have gears and shifters often operated by some kind of trigger bikes that can shift gears are very useful for most riders especially in hilly terrain or for high performance fixie bikes don t have shifters are lighter and faster good for flat commutes but require some skill bikes that have gears let you adjust your pedaling effort to account for hills wind or your own fatigue however these systems also add significant cost complexity and weight many riders commuting on busy mostly flat streets who want speed choose a bike with a single gear single speed or fixie bikes most bikes can be converted to a single speed unless the frame is designed for it a chain tensioner will be required a fixie is good for riders who want a minimal fast bike however these bikes require practice and skill to get used to fixies don t have freewheel so you have to pedal constantly to move single speed bikes are similar to fixies except a single speed does have a freewheel and lets you coast decide on your desired comfort level comfort on a bike goes beyond how you feel on the seat depending on where you ll be biking and your average commuting time you want a bike that makes you feel comfortable and in control cruiser bikes typically have a bigger seat and let you sit upright touring bikes allow for good carrying capacity and typically have drop handlebars for a more aerodynamic position road bikes also allow for an aerodynamic position but can be uncomfortable due to smaller light parts built for speed over comfort choose a mountain bike if you like going over large bumps and dirt many mountain bikes have at least a front suspension to improve comfort and steering control on rough surfaces mountain bikes can also be good for general urban riding due to stability and for going over curbs and the like beginners may find mountain bike handlebars and controls easier to use choose a road or touring bike if you re riding on mostly flat roads and terrain these bikes typically have drop handlebars that allow for several hand positions and postures touring bikes provide more comfort if you plan on carrying a lot with you because these bikes are outfitted with the necessary mounting bolts for cargo touring and road bikes also offer different gears which help you change resistance if you encounter a hill or strong winds hybrid bikes are good if you find more comfort in sitting upright and want a more padded saddle tires on hybrid bikes are wider and more durable than both road and touring bikes and can be ridden on different terrains with ease find a bike that fits you well the fit of the bike is essential to consider different bikes have different dimensions for varying body types make sure the straddle height isn t too high for you mounting and dismounting should be comfortable and easy 4 x research source make sure you have a good reach to the handlebars when gripping the handlebars you want a slight bend in your elbow you should be able to easily grip your handlebars without having to bend over too much even on road or racing bikes when riding you want to be able to keep your head up without straining your neck if you re reaching too far forward and looking at the ground your handlebars are too far away from your seat frame size and seat height will affect comfort as well look for a bike that you can easily adjust the seat height on you should be able to easily touch your feet on the ground and maintain control over your bike while you can make adjustments to most bikes you want to look for one that provides you with a good saddle position you want your knee to be directly above the ball of your foot when your pedal is in the 3 o clock position this will provide consistent movement and make it easier on your knees check wheel size bikes come equipped with tires from 12 for children s bikes up to a standard 26 or 28 inch 66 0 or 71 1 cm for adults and even higher for specialized racing bikes larger wheels may improve your speed but if your wheels are too large for your body riding will be more difficult test ride a bike before you buy it if you can t get the bike shop to let you try a bike out go to another shop or borrow one from a friend it is easier to get a bike that fits than to adjust and get acclimated to one that doesn t ride the bike around the block to get a good feel for it you should feel comfortable and in control at all times make sure you can easily reach the handlebars and all the components like shifters and brakes test the gears and brakes see how easy it is for you to shift gears and brake quickly the bike should be responsive and shouldn t take too much effort to adjust gears or brake practice turning corners you want to be comfortable with maneuverability some bikes are lighter than others and require more precision when maneuvering if you don t feel

possible ideally before they are treated by a medical professional get statements from any witnesses if there were people around who saw the accident and are willing to give an official statement regarding what they saw try to talk to them as soon as possible after the accident 6 x research source it s best to get a statement from a witness at the scene and then get their phone number in case you need to follow up with them later many witnesses won t come forward after the accident if possible take a video or audio recording on your phone of their statement write down exactly where they were when the accident occurred if possible take pictures of the scene from where they were standing so you have an image of their vantage point if there are any signs posts trees or other objects

you suggested seat tube if your inseam is 85 centimeters for example your seat tube should be 56 95 or 57 centimeters long the seat tube is usually though not always measured from the top of the tube to the center point of the crankshaft 1 x research source make sure you can stand comfortably with the top tube between your legs you re going to hit the inevitable red light and you need to be able to stand up with your feet on the ground while you wait straddle the bike and make sure that you can stand with both feet firmly on the floor if you can t you ll need to go down a frame size try out a variety of bikes to determine your reach there are a lot of different formulas out there to figure out the right reach but the truth of the matter is that everyone is different and you need to find out what is comfortable for you when trying out bikes note the length of the top tube and head tub as well as the length of the stem the smaller piece connecting the handlebars to the frame and write down the measurements you like in case you want to buy your bike online a comfortable reach should let you rest your hands comfortably on the handlebars your fingers should be free to wiggle around keep you elbows slightly bent not locked or pressed up allow you to reach all parts of the handlebars especially gears and brakes easily know that comfort must always take precedence over measurement the lengths of each tube may mean little compared to your final fit since the angles the frame is joined at affects the distance between the seat pedals and handlebars just as much as the size studies have shown for example that a longer top tube can result in the same fit as a smaller one depending on the length of the head tube these measurements are starting points as you go shopping not perfect metrics for the right fit always ask to test out 3 4 brands of bikes and try out a size above and below the one you measured for your personal geometry is unique so you need a bike that fits you buy a road bike with handlebars even to the seat height if you are just beginning it is easy especially with curved drop handlebars to get your hands lower on the bike while serious riders often prefect lower handlebars those who struggle with flexibility or are new to biking almost always prefer a bike with handlebars even to the seat height flat handlebars are rare on road bikes unless they are designed for cruising or casual riding it is difficult to go long distances with flat bars drop bars are the classic double c shaped handlebars with two front facing brakes and a variety of places to put your hands for comfort purchase a rack if you plan on traveling or commuting with your bike bike racks allow you to pack things above your back wheel but not all bikes are compatible with racks in general road bikes are not made to handle the weight of a rack though cross and touring bikes are bikes that have two holes at the top of the v leading from the seat to the back wheel and two more hole in the very back of the frame will allow you to mount a rack panniers are bags designed specifically to clip onto a bike rack and are essential if you are transporting a lot of goods or want to travel long distances buy a mountain bike to ride hard over a variety of terrain not ride quickly mountain bikes are made to take a beating and survive even city or small town dwellers like them as they can turn off on dirt paths crush over curbs and get a little muddy without worrying about the bike breaking down that said a mountain bike s true purpose is to safely bomb up and down trails covered in roots rocks and sticks and they will handle it accordingly trail bikes are great all purpose mountain bikes that can handle light and difficult trails as well as pavement and dirt roads quickly all mountain bikes are made for hard technical trails and serious riders if you plan on hitting the trials spending a little extra money will almost always be worth it for safety and comfort take your inseam measurement to determine frame size stand with your feet 6 inches apart and measure from the inside of your foot up to where your leg meets your waist between your crotch and inner thigh in inches multiply this number by 67 then subtract 4 to 5 from the answer to get the estimated length of your top tube which is the part of the frame running from the handlebars to below your seat 2 x research source use the top tube for your measurement when possible as seat tube pedal to seat measurements are tricky to determine and change from manufacturer to manufacturer 3 x research source if you have a 33 inch inseam you need a 17 5 top tube since 33 x 67 21 75 21 75 4 17 75 specialty bike makers lapierre neil pryde have different geometry multiply your inseam by 62 instead of 67 if you really want one of these bikes 4 x research source if your bike shop gives frame size by seat tube length multiply your inseam by 185 the number should be the distance between the top of your seat tube and the middle of the crankshaft the circular piece attaching the pedal to the bike 5 x research source let comfort take precedence over the calculated measurement because the angles your different tubes are joined at affects the distance between the seat pedals and handlebars these measurements will change from bike to bike and rider to rider taking measurements is a good starting points but you need to get the bike you feel most comfortable on try out different brands and a size above and below your measured size you cannot tell if a bike is the right fit if it is the only one you try your hands should rest comfortably on the handlebars so that your fingers feel free you want your elbows slightly bent not locked or pressed up on the handlebars most mountain bikers prefer their handlebars 1 2 lower than their seat height as it lowers your center of gravity you should be able to reach the shifter and brakes without losing your balance on a properly sized bike decide if your want double or single suspension all mountain bikes have shock absorbers on the front wheels allowing you to get over obstacle easily and maneuver in tricky terrain however serious bikers need to consider double suspension hardtail another name for single suspension these bikes only have shocks on the front wheel they are lighter and cheaper options and transition better to pavement riding full suspension made for technical tricky trails these bikes are heavier but far more maneuverable and useful for serious mountain bikers 6 x research source get a frame built for bigger wheels for increased comfort and ease on hard trials bigger wheels are becoming more and more fashionable but you cannot swap out smaller wheels if your frame is made for bigger ones in general you have three options for wheel size 29 inch these behemoth wheels are great at rolling over rocks and roots have provide more grip to the trail they carry momentum well downhill letting your go faster but they are harder to accelerate 27 5 inch a hybrid wheel they have some of the speed of a classic 26 with the increased movement over rocks and roots found in a 29 26 inch the traditional wheel size these are light and speedy wheels that still function well on the trail until 5 10 years ago they were the standard mountain bike wheel 7 x research source buy a bike that fits you skill level but allows room for growth bikes are expensive and you don t want buy a new one simply because you felt like saving money on the first one if you re serious about biking whether it is mountain road touring or commuting spending a little extra on a good bike now will save you money in the long term ask yourself what is your fitness level now and what do you want it to be you should get a bike somewhere in the middle 8 x research source beginner or intermediate mountain bikers might start with gentle trails that don t require good suspension but if you love the sport you will quickly want to move up to harder trails that require a better bike road riders might be fine to start with a heavier cheaper bike but you ll suffer on group rides or races as you get more experienced the frame is the most expensive part of the bike and should be your first concern brakes gears wheels and handlebars can all be swapped out or upgraded later that said good components resist wear and tear and lead to smoother riding get a comfort cruiser or hybrid bike if you only want to ride occasionally around town these bikes come in a variety of shapes and purposes but they share one thing in common they aren t made for long distances if mountain or road bikes seem too specific for you you should try out the following bikes instead they usually come in standardized measurements s m l xl so pick one that lets you comfortable reach the handlebars your knee should be slightly bent at the bottom of your pedal stroke 9 x research source fixed gear simple light bikes made almost entirely for urban cruising they offer you no extra gears they are easy to maintain and ride though they perform best on flat terrain cruiser also known as beach bikes or comfort bikes these bikes are made for comfort with high handlebars that let you ride almost completely upright hybrids great commuting or urban bikes hybrids have bigger tires than road bikes but similar geometry keeping them light and speedy while allowing you get over bumps and cracks with ease test bikes in person before buying online whenever possible shopping for bikes online is a great way to get the perfect bike for you and potentially save money but you should never by a bike online without testing it out beforehand once you ve narrowed down your search to 3 4 types of bike call you local bike shops and see if they have them in stock head down and try them out to make sure they fit you well and ride comfortably before buying online reviews are a great place to get a feel for a bike check out online bike blogs and magazines and see what they think of the bikes and read customer testimonials to see if there are any persistent issues with the bike that you want to avoid understand gears and gear ratios gearing may seem confusing but you should remember that it comes down to two factors first more gears means more options when riding allowing you to find the perfect resistance going up or down hills gears however add to the weight of the bike which is not desirable if you are racer or mountain rider heading uphill a lot the classic gearing for both road and mounting bikes is 3 gears in the front and 9 in the back resulting in a 27 speed bike 10 x research source compact cranks are smaller lighter gears in the front giving you only two big chainrings to get into but cutting down on weight understand the different types of brakes there are two large subdivisions of brakes rim brakes and disc brakes almost all mountain bikes aside from entry level use disc while road bikes have much more variety rim brakes come in many forms but they all function by clamping onto the rim of your wheel and holding it in place to slow you down there are two big pads on either side of both wheel the squeeze when you let go they are cheaper and easier to fix and maintain than discs disc breaks rely on a separate steel disc attached to your wheel that the brakes grab in order to slow down the entire wheel they are often more sensitive than rim brakes and the tight space between the breaks prevents sticks leaves etc from catching on the brakes and ruining them mid ride they are however harder to manage and calibrate without prior knowledge,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to hook up a trailer,hooking up a trailer to your car or truck is an easy way to increase the storage capacity of your vehicle however failing to attach your trailer correctly can lead to damage to your own car the trailer and other vehicles around you as you drive by securing the coupler to the hitch ball on your vehicle making sure that it s locked in properly and wiring up the lights you can hook up a trailer safely and easily,move the trailer to a long easily accessible area while it s possible to reverse towards a trailer on an angle or around corners it s much easier to attach your trailer if you approach it in a straight line if you can wheel the trailer to a long stretch of a driveway or a parking lot where you ll have plenty of room to work 1 x research source most trailers will have an attached jack with a wheel on the end that can help keep the trailer level without it being attached to anything keep this out while moving the trailer by hand to reduce some of the heavy lifting if your trailer is already full it might be more difficult to move by hand rotate it on the spot as much as you can to make the reversing job easier as trying to move it yourself may be difficult reverse your vehicle in a straight line with the trailer drive your vehicle forward so that it is directly in front of the trailer slowly reverse the car turning the wheel slightly to keep it as directly in line with the trailer as you can stop when the back of the car is around 1 foot 0 30 m away from the front of the trailer 2 x research source reversing your car into the right position and space is much easier when you have a lot of room to work with keeping the trailer and vehicle lined up properly will make driving much easier especially when you re first getting onto the road it might help to get a friend or someone else to help you reverse the car they can guide you on how far back to drive and help you correct the vehicle if it starts angling in one direction position the trailer coupler slightly above the hitch ball the trailer coupler is the metal socket on the end of the trailer that will connect to the back of your car rotate the handle on the trailer jack to raise or lower the coupler so that it s 2 to 3 inches 5 1 to 7 6 cm above the hitch ball on the back of your car 3 x research source if your trailer doesn t have an attached jack you could use a regular car jack to hold the trailer at the right height attached trailer jacks will be slightly behind the coupler on the trailer if the trailer is light enough and easy to move you could simply lift the trailer coupler forward and place it over the hitch ball the hitch ball is the metal ball on the back of your car that the trailer coupler will attach to back your vehicle up until the coupler is directly above the hitch ball with the coupler raised a little above the hitch ball get back into your vehicle and reverse backward a little further get a friend to help guide you to reverse your car so that the hitch ball and coupler are perfectly lined up 4 x research source it s possible to reverse into position by yourself but it will take a lot of trial and error reverse a little bit put on the break and get out to check how much further back you need to go repeat this process until everything is lined up if you reverse too far back you may hit the coupler and scratch or damage the back of your car unlock the trailer coupler latch the latch on top of the trailer coupler is the first mechanism that will keep your trailer locked onto the back of your car remove the latch pin from the trailer coupler and lift the latch upwards to unlock it this will allow it to sit on the hitch ball on your vehicle 5 x research source some trailers might have methods other than latch pins used to hold the latch in place try to raise the latch and see what s holding it in place to find the right way to release it the latch will likely be a metal handle on top of the trailer coupler if the coupler is already unlocked you can skip this step lower the coupler socket onto the vehicles hitch ball check the hitch ball on the back of your vehicle and remove any covers or protectors sitting on top of it use the handle attached to the trailer jack to lower the coupler socket onto the hitch ball until the weight of the trailer is supported entirely by the ball 6 x research source if the latch has been lifted and everything is positioned properly the socket should lower and sit perfectly on the hitch ball move the trailer jack out of the way the trailer jack is great for positioning the trailer properly but will get easily damaged if you drive with it attached look for a latch or latch pin on the trailer jack to rotate it up into the trailer and hold it out of the way while you drive alternately you may be able to detach the jack entirely and keep it in your vehicle until it s needed 7 x research source the wheel on the trailer jack is not designed for use while driving do not drive with the trailer jack on or extended at risk of damaging the trailer your vehicle or other vehicles on the road lock the coupler latch and insert the latch pin with the coupler sitting securely on the hitch ball reverse the process of unlocking the coupler latch to lock it in place push the handle on the coupler down so that it is parallel to the ground insert the latch pin to hold it in place and prevent the coupler from unlocking while you drive 8 x research source different trailers and trailer couplers may have slightly different locking mechanisms always consult the owner s manual for your own trailer to make sure you lock it into place properly attach the safety chains to the back of your vehicle in a cross pattern run one of the safety chains below the coupler and hitch ball and attach it to the opposite side of the hitch ball repeat with the other chain to create an overlapping cross underneath the coupler and hitch ball 9 x research source the safety chains will be the last safety mechanism in place if the coupler latch fails so they are legally required in many places if the coupler disconnects from the vehicle while you re driving it will fall and land on the crossed chains rather than hitting the road the safety chains will be attached to your trailer just below the coupler locate the wiring socket on the back of your vehicle the wiring socket is a wide plug that will power the lights on your trailer look for a small panel on the back of your vehicle inside the trunk or even a loose wire close to the hitch ball make sure it isn t damaged and is free from any corrosion that may prevent it from working properly 10 x research source if you cannot find the wiring socket on your car check the manufacturer s instructions for your car for further assistance if your wiring socket is damaged corroded or frayed in any way have it looked over by a mechanic before plugging the trailer wire into it plug the trailer wire into your vehicle there should be a loose wire with a plug on one end near the trailer coupler run the wire above the coupler and the hitch ball and plug it into the socket on the back of your vehicle press the plug securely into the socket and use any latches on the wire to hold them together 11 x research source some trailers will have metal loops along the side of the coupler that the wire can be threaded through to keep it out of the way avoid running the wire underneath the coupler and hitch ball as this will increase the chances of it getting damaged or becoming unplugged should the trailer detach from your vehicle test the headlights blinkers and brake lights on the trailer before you start driving you should always make sure the trailer lights are working start your vehicle engage the handbrake and turn on the headlights check the appropriate lights on the back of the trailer are on before repeating the same process with each indicator and the brake lights 12 x research source if any of the lights aren t working you should not drive the trailer this is the same as driving without the corresponding light on your car working call a mechanic to ask for assistance before driving your car with the trailer attached rather than moving back and forth from the driver s seat of your car to the rear end of your trailer ask a friend to check the lights while you activate

how to listen to your local air traffic control,air traffic control atc is responsible for providing crucial information to pilots around busy airports they communicate with pilots on designated radio frequencies to keep airport operations running smoothly and safely their communication is also accessible to the public whether you are a student pilot retired pilot or just want to know what s going on in the friendly skies you can listen to air traffic controllers at work any time,find live frequencies obtain a radio scanner that is capable of receiving frequencies between 118 0 and 136 975 mhz good brands to check out include uniden and whistler you can also find general coverage receivers from icom yaesu grundig kenwood and others that will pick up air frequencies you re better off selecting a good scanner instead of a general coverage unit thanks to the scanner s ability to easily monitor multiple frequencies realize that in radio electronics you get what you pay for a scanner from one of the aforementioned brands will outperform a no name brand that claims airline coverage most scanners pick up the entirety of the aircraft band you can also listen to air traffic control facilities from around the world at websites including liveatc net globalair com airnav com and radioreference com memorize some of the basic frequencies 121 5 is the emergency frequency if there is some sort of emergency pilots will transmit on it you could also hear an emergency locator beacon on this frequency if a plane crashes 122 750 mhz is the frequency for general aviation air to air communications 123 025 mhz is the frequency for helicopters air to air communications 123 450 mhz is the unofficial frequency for air to air communications search 122 0 123 65 for unicom uncontrolled airports and air to air communications search 128 825 132 000 mhz for arinc frequencies airlines corporate aviation and general aviation calling ahead for fuel parking and other requests find an aeronautical sectional chart you most likely want to be looking for a chart of your local area from the closest airport older versions of these charts will usually work just fine online sectional charts for your local area are available on www skyvector com find the closest airport on the chart airports are denoted by blue or magenta circles with lines inside representing runways next to the circle is a block of text with the airport name and information about that airport the control tower frequency is denoted by ct 000 0 where the following numbers indicate the frequency used by atc for example the frequency for wittman regional airport in oshkosh wi is ct 118 5 understanding the lingo if the airport is uncontrolled no tower or the tower operates part time a c in a circle after a frequency number will be used to denote a common traffic advisory frequency ctaf a star will be after the tower frequency to denote that airport as having a part time tower at this type of airport pilots communicate directly with one another and tell each other their position and intentions identifying the airports all controlled airports will be denoted by blue circles while uncontrolled airports are magenta airports with runways over 8 000 feet 2 438 4 m are not enclosed in circles and simply have a diagram depicting the runway layout which is outlined in blue controlled or magenta uncontrolled listen to weather forecasts and airport information as you prepare to land some airports have awos automated weather observing system asos automated surface observing system or atis automated terminal information service frequencies listed on the chart these are automated or repeating broadcasts that provide pilots with weather and airport information as they prepare to land or depart obtain a complete list of frequencies if you have access to an airport facility directory you can find more frequencies than those available on the chart at larger airports pilots receive their flight plan clearances from a clearance delivery frequency communicate on taxiways with a ground frequency and get takeoff and landing clearance from the tower frequency once pilots are airborne they will talk to an approach departure frequency and once in route they might even talk to a center frequency if you are lucky or live close enough to an airport you might be able to receive several of these frequencies understand that a pilot starts with the aircraft id number if a controller gives a pilot an instruction he or she will prefix it with the aircraft s identification number for commercial flights this will just be the flight number such as united 2311 a smaller aircraft is identified by the number on their tail listen for instructions from the control tower after the flight number the controller will give an instruction such as enter downwind this instructs the pilot to enter the traffic pattern at a specific location the pilot will then read back the instruction so the controller can verify that it was understood correctly be prepared to change your radio frequency sometimes controllers will hand off a pilot to another frequency an example would be a controller saying november 12345 contact approach on 124 32 good day once again the pilot will read back the instruction landing at an uncontrolled airports operations at uncontrolled airports are much less formal most of the time pilots will broadcast blind transmissions to anyone on the frequency announcing their position or intentions words like upwind crosswind downwind base and final denote specific positions in the traffic pattern learn the phonetic alphabet pilots and controllers use it to communicate letters since they can often be confused you might also hear someone use niner to communicate

how to gift a vehicle,there are several reasons you might decide to give a vehicle as a gift perhaps you are giving it to a family member such as a child who just received a driver s license maybe you are donating it in order to purchase a new vehicle and you do not wish to sell your old one either way the basic step involved in gifting a vehicle is to transfer the title of ownership but several details might make this task more complex you need to ensure that you own the vehicle in full this means there can be no active liens on the vehicle if you co own the vehicle with another person that person must be able to provide a signature as well except in rare cases such as death at which point you might require the assistance of your local probate court as well as the executor of the estate of the deceased once the title is signed over to the new owner it must be presented at the department of motor vehicles to complete the title transfer,verify ownership this sounds obvious but the first step before you can give away a vehicle is to make sure that you are the legal owner to do that you must have the title the title is a certificate that you should have received from the dealer probably after you paid off all the loans 1 x research source the title will name the rightful owner or owners of the vehicle if you have lost your title certificate you will need to get a replacement from your state s department of motor vehicles each state has a different procedure and fee for this at http www dmv org replacing a lost title php you can find a handy map of the u s with contact information for the dmv in each state satisfy all liens a lienholder is someone you borrowed money from with the car as collateral if you still owe them money their name will appear on the title before you can give away the car you must pay off all loans and the lienholders must sign off on the title certificate that they have been paid 2 x research source involve probate court if an inheritance if the owner s name on the title is someone who is deceased and the gift is an inheritance you may need to go to probate court to get an order for the transfer alternatively in some states it is possible to file a simple affidavit with the registry of motor vehicles in order to take possession you will need to check with your state law 3 x research source if the car was owned jointly by a married couple for example and one dies and the remaining owner wants to give the car away as a gift the surviving individual can in most cases transfer the car alone a copy of the death certificate may be needed to accompany the title complete the transfer section on the back of the title the person giving the vehicle will be required to provide his or her signature driver s license information and odometer information for the vehicle at the time of the gift the person receiving the car must fill out the buyer portion of the title where the title asks for the sale price you will fill in gift be careful when completing these steps many title certificates specify that the writing must be done cleanly and clearly with no erasures or cross outs even a simple printing error could require you to obtain a new copy of the title certificate and start over get lienholders to sign off if the lienholders have not yet already given you something to show that the loans are satisfied you will need to have them sign off on the title as satisfied in full if your loan was from a dealer you will want to contact the lending department if you obtained your loan from a bank or some other lending institution then find your original loan paperwork that will tell you who to contact for payoff information check with the state registry of motor vehicles for additional gift requirements in general gifts between family members are freely allowed and there would be no sales tax at the time of the transfer 4 x research source however each state s laws are different and you should check with your own state some states may require proof of a family relationship for the gift to be tax free verify insurance for recipient the person receiving the car will ordinarily have to demonstrate that he or she is covered by insurance before taking ownership this is not exactly a concern for the person giving the gift but the new owner in order to drive the car will have to get it insured and registered the new owner s insurance company will usually issue the owner a card or letter to show proof of insurance 5 x research source check inspection requirements some states will require the car to be inspected separately at the time of the transfer other states will not you can check with your state s department of motor vehicles to find out your requirements in many states this will require you to take the car to a licensed inspection station and undergo a safety inspection emissions test or other similar procedure deliver the documents to rmv in most states the person receiving the gift will have to take the completed documents to the registry of motor vehicles you will turn in the original title with all the completed signatures along with whatever fee may be required register the car according to the state s usual procedures this will be up to the new owner of the car registration is the procedure in all states that certifies that the car may be licensed and driven in the state in many states you can call the registry ahead of time to make an appointment 6 x research source wait for the new title to arrive as the recipient of a gift vehicle you will need to receive a new title the registry will deliver this in your own name usually within a couple weeks when it arrives check the new certificate of title to make sure that the information is all printed accurately this document is your proof of ownership of the vehicle if there are any errors even if they appear minor such as an incorrect middle initial for example these could cause trouble for you in the future if you see any mistakes notify the registry of motor vehicles immediately you will probably have to submit an application for a correction 7 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

all racers must go through one or more of the junior levels to move up 5 x research source turn 18 years old formula 1 racers must all be a minimum age to hold a license some younger racers are good enough to be considered for formula 1 but will not be eligible until they reach the proper age if you are still too young look at gaining some more experience in any of the junior single seater race series to add to your race points accumulate 40 race points these points are acquired based on performance and placement in junior race series events 40 points must be acquired over a 3 year period to be eligible to get your formula 1 license 6 x research source accumulate 300 driving kilometers in a formula 1 car drivers must complete 184 miles 300 kilometers of racing in a recent formula 1 vehicle you can complete this driving requirement during official pre season in season and post season tests but the entire portion must be completed within 48 hours additionally you must complete this test within 180 days before you apply for your license 7 x research source accept an offer to drive for an f1 team if you have performed well as an amateur an owner might ask for you to drive for their team these teams are often owned by car companies and have their own sponsorships to cover costs they usually sign their drivers on a season to season basis 8 x research source get sponsorships most formula 1 drivers have some sponsors that require additional work off the track to attract sponsors you need to have success on the track and a positive public opinion you may have to do appearances or photo shoots for your sponsor in addition to your on track work racing is a very expensive sport so drivers must look to add to supplement their racing income whenever possible 9 x research source pay to drive in f1 pay drivers are common in many levels of motorsports including formula 1 instead of being paid by the race team the driver uses money from sponsorships or their personal fortune to fund the racing operations while this isn t practical for most new racers in formula 1 it is an option if you have the ability to pay for it 10 x research

how to check fuses,a blown fuse can be annoying but it actually helps prevent electrical damage and fire fortunately fuses are inexpensive and easy to replace if the power s out in your home or car you should be able to check the fuses simply by looking at them look inside the fuse in question for black charred marks or a broken filament wire if you can t see any obvious signs you can always use a test light or multimeter to figure out if the fuse is working properly,look for the fuse box in your basement or garage check for a metal box with a door inside you ll see lots of glass fuses that screw into sockets typically fuse boxes are located in basements garages laundry rooms and attics 1 x research source if you have trouble finding your fuse box check the utility meter outside your home try to follow the wire that leads from the meter fuse boxes and circuit breakers are usually located near where power enters the house older homes have glass fuses that look like light bulbs when fuses blow they need to be replaced newer homes on the other hand have circuit breakers instead which just need to be flipped and reset turn off the power and unplug the appliances on the blown circuit look for a large switch at the top of the panel and toggle it from on to off in addition to shutting off the main power unplug the appliances that turned off when the fuse blew that way they won t overload the replacement fuse when you turn on main power 2 x research source if there s no main power switch you should see a large block at the top of the panel pull it out and check for on and off labels if it s labeled reinsert it with the off side facing up if there s no label set the block aside while you replace the blown fuse check the fuses for charred glass or broken filaments see if there s a diagram or labels on the inside of the panel door if you re lucky you ll be able to look up the room where the power went out and track down the corresponding fuse twist that fuse counterclockwise pull it out from the socket and look inside the glass for black marks or a broken filament wire 3 x research source if your fuse box is unlabeled check each fuse individually for charred marks or broken filaments once you ve found the one that blew label it if you label your fuses every time you replace one you ll eventually have a full diagram of the box swap the blown fuse out for one with the same power rating look for a number on the fuse which indicates its amp rating write down the number or take the blown fuse with you to the hardware store to ensure you get an identical match then plug the replacement fuse in and turn it clockwise to lock it in place 4 x research source fuse ratings vary by country but common amperages include 15 20 and 30 turn the power back on to test the new fuse once you ve plugged in the fuse double check to make sure you disconnected all of your electrical devices from the broken circuit when you re ready flip the main fuse switch or reinsert the main block to restore power to your home then test the circuit by checking the lights or plugging in your electronic devices 5 x research source if your electronics still don t work after replacing the fuse shut down main power and make sure the fuse is tightly connected if the fuse blows again soon after you replaced it you may be using more electrical devices than the circuit can handle try using fewer devices or unplug non essential appliances when they re not in use 6 x research source if you still can t find the problem call an experienced electrician it could mean that your home s wiring is faulty look under the hood or dashboard for your vehicle s fuse box many cars have 2 or more fuse boxes but there s no universal standard for their placement most manufacturers place them near the car s engine or battery beneath the steering wheel or inside the glove box look for a gray or black box it may be labeled as fuses 7 x research source check your car s manual if you have trouble finding the fuse boxes if you don t have your manual search online for fuse box placement plus your car s year make and model find the fuse that controls the device that s stopped working lift the latch on the side of the fuse box to loosen the cover check the inside of the lid for a diagram of the devices each fuse controls your manual may also include a diagram but if all else fails you can also find information on your specific vehicle online 8 x research source the diagram will also list the fuse s amperage which you ll need to know to purchase a replacement be sure to turn your car off before troubleshooting the fuse box remove the blown fuse from the box using fuse pullers or tweezers some cars and fuse replacement kits include small plastic fuse pullers which you can use to pluck the fuse from the box if you don t have fuse pullers handy a pair of tweezers will do the trick in a pinch you can also carefully pull the fuse from the box with your fingers 9 x research source make sure your car is completely off before you pull out the blown fuse keep the keys out of the ignition to avoid accidentally putting it in run or accessories mode otherwise you could get a nasty shock check the fuse for a broken filament or discoloration car fuses are small so it s a little tougher to find signs that one blew hold it up to the light and look closely inside for a thin wire that connects the 2 sides of the fuse if the wire is broken or if you see charred marks the fuse has blown 10 x research source if the wire is intact and the fuse seems fine double check your diagram to ensure you have the correct fuse if you ve checked each fuse individually and none have blown your car s electrical system may need a mechanic s attention if you re not able to visually tell if the fuse has blown then you may need to check the fuses with a multimeter to determine if it s working install a new fuse with an amperage that matches the one that blew head to an auto shop or major retailer s automotive department to find fuses for your car bring the blown fuse with you to ensure you get the right match once you ve purchased the right replacement simply insert it into the slot where you removed the blown fuse 11 x research source make sure the car is off before you set the fuse into the empty slot press down with a little pressure until it pops into place car fuses are color coded so if the fuses are a different color you know right away they aren t a match additionally be sure the prong shape of the new fuse matches the old one if necessary ask an employee at the store for help finding the right replacement check automotive fuses with a simple test light put your key in the ignition and turn it to accessories mode open the fuse box then insert the tester s probe into the tiny port on the face of a fuse if the tester lights up the fuse is working properly 13 x research source using a test light is a great way to find a blown fuse when you can t identify visual signs such as a broken filament or black marks you can find car fuse test lights online at auto shops and in the automotive department at most major retailers the tester has 1 or 2 prongs that fit into the tiny test ports on the outside face of all automotive fuses test a plug fuse with a multimeter if you don t see signs that it blew set your multimeter to test resistance the setting looks like the greek letter omega or ω turn off the fuse box s main power switch then remove the fuse you d like to test set the fuse glass side down on a non conductive surface such as a wood workbench or laminate counter so the metal plug end faces up 14 x research source plug fuses which are often found in home fuse boxes have threaded terminals that look like the ends of standard light bulbs to test it touch one of the multimeter s probes to the very tip of the fuse s terminal touch the other probe to the side of the terminal near where the threading stops if the multimeter displays a resistance between 0 and 5 ω ohms the fuse is good a higher resistance means a degraded or potentially blown fuse and a reading of ol over limit means the fuse is definitely blown 15 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source like an automotive test light using a multimeter to test a home plug fuse is a good solution if you suspect a blown fuse but can t find any clear visual signs use a multimeter to test cylindrical fuses in electronic devices if your electronic instrument or appliance is on the fritz remove the fuse according to the manufacturer s instructions typically electronic devices use tube shaped fuses with a glass body and terminals at each end set your multimeter to test resistance and place the fuse on a non conductive surface 16 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source touch one of the multimeter s probes to each of the fuse s terminals as with plug fuses a resistance reading of 0 to 5 ω means the fuse works a higher reading or a reading of ol means the fuse is bad you can inspect cylindrical fuses for broken filaments or charred marks just like automotive and plug fuses however if you can t see clearly inside the fuse testing it with a multimeter can help you figure out whether or not it

how to adjust bike brakes,routinely adjusting your bike brakes will help them perform better and ensure you re riding safely the two main things you ll want to adjust in your bike s brake system are the brake pads and the brake cables worn down brake pads that are too low or high on the rim can be a safety hazard brake cables that are too loose will make it harder to brake fortunately you can easily fix these issues with some simple tools,check your brake pads before you make any adjustments the brake pads are the pads that clamp down on the front tire of your bike when you pull the brake lever if the brake pads are worn down past the line labeled wear line you ll need to replace them before you make adjustments to your brakes 1 x research source if the wear lines on your brake pads aren t labeled they should be marked by grooves on the side of the pads instead you can order new brake pads online or pick some up at your local bike shop make sure your wheel lines up correctly in the dropouts as well or else it won t make good contact with your brakes 2 x expert source jonas jackel bicycle shop owner expert interview 18 february 2020 squeeze the brake lever to see where the pads hit the rim both brake pads should be coming into contact with the rim of the front tire at the same time they should be hitting the center of the rim with an equal amount of space above and below the pad if the pads are hitting the rim too high or low they could come into contact with the rubber part of the tire or the spokes on the bike 3 x research source crouch down to get a good look at the brake pads as you re squeezing the brake lever if your bike has a quick release mechanism check that it isn t loose or hasn t come undone otherwise your brakes won t squeeze tightly on the wheel 4 x expert source jonas jackel bicycle shop owner expert interview 18 february 2020 use an allen wrench to loosen the bolts holding the brake pads in place turn the allen wrench counterclockwise to loosen the bolts don t loosen the bolts all the way or the brake pads will come out of the brake pad holder 5 x research source move the brake pads up or down in the brake pad holder they should easily move up and down once the bolts are loosened if the pads were too low on the rim move them up until they re centered if the pads were too high on the rim move them down until they re centered 6 x research source re tighten the brake pad bolts with the allen wrench keep turning the allen wrench clockwise until the bolts are fully tightened check to make sure the brake pads are centered readjust if needed 7 x research source test the tightness of your cables by pulling each brake lever when you pull the brake levers they should be about 1 ½ inches 3 8 cm away from the grip on the handlebars if the levers hit the handlebars when you pull them the brake cables are too loose 8 x research source loosen the barrel adjusters for minor brake cable adjustments if your brake cables are just slightly loose loosening the barrel adjusters might fix the problem the barrel adjusters are located where the brake cables meet the brake levers 9 x research source loosen the barrel adjuster attached to the loose brake cable by turning it counterclockwise loosening the barrel adjuster will actually slightly tighten the brake cable after you loosen the barrel adjuster pull the brake lever to see if it fixed the problem if the brake cable is still too loose you ll need to adjust it on the caliper leave the barrel adjuster as it is don t tighten it yet unscrew the bolt holding the brake cable on the caliper the caliper is the main frame of the brakes that the brake pads are attached to the brake cable is the thin cable extending off the caliper locate the bolt that s holding the brake cable use an allen wrench to turn it counterclockwise a few times until the bolt is slightly loose 10 x research source don t unscrew the bolt all the way just rotate the allen wrench counterclockwise 2 3 times until the bolt is loose pull the brake cable outward to tighten it now that the bolt is loosened you shouldn t have any problem pulling the cable hold it in place with your fingers once you ve pulled it taut as you pull the cable the brake pads should tighten on the rim of the front tire you want them to be tight enough that there s some resistance when you turn the tire but not so tight that the tire isn t able to turn at all 11 x research source if you can t turn the tire at all pull less hard on the brake cable so it s not as tight tighten the bolt holding the brake cable on the caliper use the allen wrench and turn it clockwise 2 3 times until it won t turn anymore the cable should be secure in place once the bolt is tightened tighten the barrel adjusters on the handlebars turn the barrel adjusters you loosened before clockwise several times until they re fully tightened tightening the barrel adjusters will loosen the brake pads that are clamped onto the front tire once the barrel adjusters are tightened your brake cables should be all set test the brake cables again by pulling the brake levers when you pull the levers now there should be 1 ½ inches 3 8 cm between the lever and the grip on the handlebars,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to read an aviation routine weather report metar,aviators use metar reports to gain essential knowledge about flying conditions to a casual observer a report may look like a string of random and numbers but every report contains a lot of data these reports aren t tough to decode once you know what the look for after getting a report from an airport or weather center read the first few strings to figure out where the data came from the rest of the report will then contain information about visibility the weather and all sorts of other conditions if you need assistance look up a chart explaining common abbreviations to understand what kind of weather you will be facing when you re out on the runway,obtain a metar report from an airport aviation center these reports are often free and available even when you re not operating a plane check with your government s aviation office or national weather service online the aviation weather center in the u s for instance offers reports access reports at https www aviationweather gov metar 1 x research source to request a report from the weather center select a location you can also choose a time period if you wish to access a past report use the initial code letters to identify the type of report if you re looking at a metar report you will see it listed at the beginning there are other types of reports as well each type of report conveys different information distinguish between these types of reports to get weather details you need 2 x research source metar reports are routine hourly reports a new metar report is issued at the end of each hour speci indicates a special unscheduled report speci reports usually happen for special conditions like low visibility and thunderstorms taf means terminal aerodrome forecast tafs are similar to metars but less common and used to provide a forecast for a general area note the station identifier after the report type the id tag will look something like kaff k represents a location in the us the letters after it tell you which station the report came from every country and station has its own identifying code given out by the world meteorlogical organization 3 x research source kaff for instance represents the air force academy in colorado egll is the code for london heathrow e represents the uk while gll stands for heathrow airport rjaa represents tokyo narita airport read the next numbers to find the report s date and time look for a series of 6 numbers followed by a z such as 212355z the first pair of numbers stands for the day of the month the rest of the code represents the time in zulu also called universal or greenwich mean time note that the report doesn t include information about the month or year it was issued 4 x research source for example in 212355z 21 shows you that the report came on the 21st day of the month it happened at 2355z zulu which would be 1755 or 11 55 am in colorado springs look for a short phrase explaining how the report was modified in the example the modifier is indicated by cor if it is present the modifier information is always listed after the time and date you can tell it apart from the rest of the report by how short it is it also doesn t have any numbers in it unlike the codes before and after it 5 x research source auto means the report came from an automated station cor tells you that someone corrected the initial report a manual observer changed something the automated station got wrong you won t see a modifier for reports issued by a person if no one is on duty at the station then you may start seeing automated reports view the first 3 digits of the next code for the wind s direction the next code a combination of letters and numbers is all about the wind the wind s direction is listed according to true north true north means the direction of the earth s axis not the magnetic north you see when you look at a compass true north can be found using maps or a compass 6 x research source in the code vrb05kt vrb represents the wind s direction vrb means that the wind direction varies the first letters of the code could also be something like 120 picture a compass where 0 degrees is at the top and 180 degrees is at the bottom a 120 means the wind is blowing from the southeast use the remaining digits in the wind code for wind speed the wind direction is always followed by 2 or 3 numbers indicating the wind s speed the speed is listed in knots or kt you may also see some additional letters from time to time describing how hard the wind is blowing 7 x research source in the code vrb05kt the 05kt means that the wind is blowing at a speed of 5 knots you might see the letter g in the middle of the wind report for example g26kt stands for gusts of wind blowing at 26 knots the letter v tells you that a strong wind blowing at more than 6 knots varies in direction for example you might see 180v260 the wind is changing direction between 180 and 260 degrees check the short wind visibility code to determine air quality the wind visibility code consists of a short series of numbers usually accompanied by a unit of measurement in the u s wind visibility is often measured in statute miles for reports outside of the u s expect to see the visibility listed in meters 8 x research source a visibility of 15sm means you can see for about 15 miles 24 km the visibility can also be listed as a fraction if it looks like 1 1 2sm that means the visibility is 1 ½ miles a visibility in measured in meters may be listed as something like 1400 the unit of measurement won t be listed but you can tell it s in meters because mile measurements don t usually go higher than 30 read strings starting with r for runway visibility a string of letters and numbers like r36l 2400ft tells you everything you need to know about the runway runway information isn t in every report if you don t see it following the air visibility code then expect clear conditions on the ground the runway visibility will tell you how far you can see from the runway 9 x research source the first set of numbers indicates what runway the report covers r36 means runway 36 areas with parallel runways have a marker like l which means the left runway the second number explains the visibility distance in a code containing 2400ft the visibility is 2 400 ft 730 m view the present weather conditions if they are listed in the report the codes following the wind information explain any significant weather conditions in the area it can include precipitation weather intensity and other factors that affect navigation there are many different signs so consider looking up a chart to interpret the listing for instance try the chart at https www weather gov media wrh mesowest metar_decode_key pdf 10 x research source intensity descriptor precipitation obscuration other light mi shallow dz drizzle br mist po dust sand whirls moderate no qualifier bc patches ra rain

ts thunderstorm pl ice pellets hz haze ds duststorm fz freezing gr hail py spray pr partial gs small hail or snow pellets va volcanic ash up unknown precipitation for example you may see shra it stands for light rain showers a code of tsra means thunderstorms with heavy rain use the 3 letters starting the 6 digit codes to determine cloud coverage sky condition codes start with 3 letters and end with 3 numbers the letters tell you the amount of sky covered by clouds a metar report can have more than 1 code describing the different groups of clouds so be sure to read the entire report for instance the report may include few040 sct060 sct075 sct090 bkn220 11 x research source skc is the clear sky code for manually generated reports automated reports use clr for elevations under 12 000 ft 3 700 m few means there aren t many clouds to worry about the clouds cover ⅛ to 2 8 of the sky sct indicates for scattered clouds meaning ⅜ to 4 8 of the sky is covered bkn stands for broken in broken conditions ⅝ to ⅞ of the sky will be covered overcast days come with the code ovc the sky will be totally covered by clouds when you see this code read the following numbers to determine how high the clouds are the numbers measure the height of the base of the clouds this information is listed as hundreds of feet above the ground if the clouds seem to continue on indefinitely then you will see the letters vv to show vertical visibility you may also see letters attached at the end of the code describing special types of clouds 12 x research source for instance bkn220 tells you that the clouds are at 22 000 ft 6 700 m all you have to do is add a pair of 0s onto the end of the code to figure out the cloud height you may also see something like bkn220tcu the tcu stands for towering cumulonimbus cb means cumulonimbus clouds which are usually present during storms acc is altocumulus castellanus view the temperature and dew point marked by a combined number the temperature and dew point numbers are separated by a slash the first number tells you the temperature in degrees celsius the number after the slash lists the dew point in celcius for example you may see 15 moi on a report 13 x research source in 15 m01 the temperature is 15 c 59 f an m before the dew point means minus a dew point listed as m01 corresponds to 01 check the altimeter setting by the code starting with an a the a stands for altimeter so you can always recognize this code listed after the temperature the code describes the atmospheric pressure in the area it will either be listed as inches of mercury or hectopascals pilots use this information to ensure the plane s altimeter is displaying the correct altitude 14 x research source a2957 is an example of an altimeter setting it corresponds to 29 57 inches of mercury or 29 57 hg generally reports list the altimeter setting in hg reports outside the u s may occasionally use a code like q1030 or 1030 hectopascals check the remarks for any additional information added to the report the remarks section is for anything else the reporter thinks you need to know a metar report may have very few additional comments or it may have a bunch these comments can include information about when a thunderstorm began or ended the type of station making the report air pressure or any other notes there are many different remarks that could be added so be sure to look at a guide like https weather cod edu notes metar html for instance acsl means altocumulus standing lenticular clouds then dsnt tells you the clouds are distant beyond 10 miles away the code se s shows that they are southeast by south the code slp960 indicates the sea level pressure in tenths of millibars or hectopascals a code of shra dsnt n e se and dsnt nw indicates moderate rain showers in the distant north through east through southeast and the distant northwest general numbers like 60001 55000 usually represent automated maintenance data you don t need to bother with trying to decipher them last cor stands for last correction a number of 43 tells you the correction was made at 43 minutes past the hour,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to build an inexpensive electric bicycle,an electric bike is a lot easier to build than you might think all you need is a bike in good working order a conversion kit and a battery using a conversion kit makes the process super simple and fast and if you shop online to find the best deal on the kit and repurpose a bike you already own this can be an inexpensive project,select a mountain bike front disc brakes and wide handlebars if you don t own a bike already search online or in your local area to find a second hand bike at a good price luckily you can use just about any bike you have on hand though certain features will yield the best results 1 x research source choose a bike with wheels that are 26 20 or 16 as these are the most common off the shelf wheel sizes the smaller the wheels are usually found on folding bikes and will accelerate more quickly be bumpier and be less efficient at cruising speed mountain bikes are most commonly converted to electric bikes though you could use a different type as long as it has a strong frame and standard bottom bracket don t use a bike with a carbon fiber frame or forks as these aren t strong enough to support the extra weight or handle the extra torque 2 x research source wider handlebars are best as they give you plenty of room for all your accessories and lights front disc brakes will make it easier for you to stop on steep hills pick up an electric bicycle conversion kit if you ve never built an electric bicycle before a conversion kit will make the process much simpler these bolt on kits contain a throttle speed controller and a wheel with a hub motor some also come with gauges displays and brake levers though these are not strictly necessary 3 x research source ensure the kit comes with a wheel that is the same size as the existing wheels on your bike it s much easier to replace the front wheel than the back due to the position of the gears so opt for a kit in which the hub motor is on the front wheel in most cases the battery doesn t come with the conversion kit for ease of installation though it s best to purchase the battery and the conversion kit from the same manufacturer choose a 36 or 48 volt battery with a capacity of 10ah or 20ah choose a battery designed for use on an electric bicycle as it will come with a charger and be much easier to install make sure the voltage and capacity of the battery you choose are compatible with the conversion kit you purchased the higher the voltage of your bike s battery the more powerful your bike will be when building an electric bike choose a 36 or 48 volt battery to allow for speed and comfort 4 x research source the capacity of the battery defines how long it ll last if you ll be taking short trips a 10ah will suit you well while a 20ah battery will provide you with extra capacity for slightly longer journeys 5 x research source remove the wheel you need to replace begin by opening the rim or cantilever brake using the lever if applicable if the bike has disc brakes remove the retaining or cotter pin or the clips or springs that hold the pads in place pull the pads out with needle nose pliers and set them aside 6 x research source to remove the front wheel turn the bike over so it s sitting on the seat and handlebars then flip the quick release lever over to the open position then simply lift the front wheel off of the bike 7 x research source to remove the back wheel crouch behind the bike hold the frame with your non dominant hand and use your dominant hand to pull the derailer backward then lift the bike frame up and off of the rear wheel with your non dominant hand and unhook the chain with your dominant hand 8 x research source transfer the tire and inner tube from the old wheel to the new wheel let the air out of the old tire and use a tire lever to separate the tire from the wheel pull off both the tire and the inner tube reverse the process to install the tire and inner tube on the wheel that came with the conversion kit 9 x research source put the wheel with the electric hub on your bike and connect the brake components simply reverse the process you used to remove the wheel in order to reinstall it be sure to adjust the chain so it fits properly if you re replacing the back wheel if the bike has rim or cantilever brakes simply close them over the new wheel using the lever if the bike has disc brakes put the pads back in place and secure them using the clips springs or cotter or retaining pin 10 x research source adjust the brakes as needed either by aligning the calipers for mechanical brakes or pumping the brake lever for hydraulic brakes attach the speed controller and the throttle follow the directions in the conversion kit for installing these 2 parts using the included hardware use the provided bolts to secure the speed controller to the frame of the bike above the chain then attach the throttle to the handlebars so it s easy to reach 11 x research source if you have any other accessories attach them as well secure the speed sensor to the back wheel and connect any displays and gauges to the handlebars with the included hardware 12 x research source connect the battery to the speed controller and the throttle follow the instructions included with the kit to connect each part typically you ll only need to plug the connector on the speed controller into the connector on the battery then repeat the process for the throttle be sure not to touch the battery wires together as this could create a dangerous spark 13 x research source mount the battery onto the bike most e bike batteries are designed to fit on the frame in place of a water bottle holder this is the ideal placement since it keeps the center of gravity low use the included hardware to attach the battery to the frame as indicated by the instructions that came with the battery 14 x research source alternatively you could place the battery in a box or basket on the front or back of the bike particularly if it is too large to fit well on the frame such as if it s more than 60 volts secure any loose cables use zip ties to attach any loose parts to the frame keep safety in mind as you don t want any cables to get caught while you re riding 15 x research source ride your electric bike that s it you can now cruise around on your e bike just press down gently on the throttle when you re ready to ride go for a test drive in a less populated area so you can get used to it before you take it out on the road charge the bike when necessary the e bike battery comes with a charger making the process super simple follow the instructions for connecting the battery to the charger and plug it into a compatible outlet whenever you need to 16 x research

how to hook up jumper cables,your battery can be too weak to start your car for a number of reasons including a loss of charge from cold weather age or leaving the lights on overnight whatever the cause you can use jumper cables to connect the dead battery to a live one make sure both batteries are the same size then carefully begin clamping the cables in place the dead battery may then receive enough of a charge to get the car started again,park the vehicles so the batteries are near each other drive the vehicle with the live battery which is the donor car towards the vehicle with the dead battery the battery is typically located underneath the car s hood so you can either park the cars next to each other or facing one another don t let the cars touch though 1 x research source engage the parking brake on both cars the parking brake ensures that the cars stay in place as you jump the battery use the gear stick if your car has one shift the car to p or park to engage the brake setting the car to n or neutral will also prevent it from rolling if your car has manual transmission set it to neutral then engage the emergency brake 2 x research source the emergency brake may be located near the gear stick or gas pedal turn the cars off and remove the keys make sure the donor car is completely off you should hear the engine shut down and can test the radio to see that it doesn t have any power running to it also take the key out of car with the dead battery so it can t start up when the jumper cables are attached 3 x research source doing this protects both engines from power surges and reduces the risk of electrical shock check the batteries to make sure they are the same voltage the voltage will be printed in a visible location usually on a white or yellow sticker on top of the battery it will say something like 12v the live battery needs to match the dead battery or else it can send a dangerous current that burns out the car s systems 4 x research source batteries with similar voltages will be the same size still look for the voltage on the label to avoid possible damage if you aren t sure about using a battery avoid the risk if possible try to find a different donor battery or use a rechargeable battery pack locate the positive and negative battery terminals in each car the cables leading to the positive terminal are almost always red the negative terminal s cables are black if you re not sure the battery will have a and sign on it to mark the positive and negative terminals respectively the red cables lead to the terminal and the black cables go to the terminal 5 x research source check the terminals for corrosion first it looks like white green and blue powder clean the terminals by wiping them with a rag or wire brush separate the jumper cable clamps by laying them on the ground position the cables flat on the ground stretching them out between the 2 cars move the clamps so they aren t touching each other any accidental contact can cause your car s electrical system to short circuit 6 x research source leads on jumper cables are often made in different lengths to prevent them from touching if they are the same length make sure they have not been modified or damaged in any way clamp a red clamp to the positive terminal of the dead battery leave the rest of the jumper cable on the ground as you bring the clamp over to the car double check the and labels on the battery before attaching the clamp squeeze the clamp to open it then fit it securely around the metal terminal 7 x research source on some vehicles you may have to remove a plastic cover from the positive battery terminal before you can make this connection you remove it by twisting it counterclockwise by hand connect each clamp 1 at a time go slowly in order to avoid mistakes that can damage the vehicles secure the other red clamp to the positive terminal on the donor battery carry the clamp to the other car so you can fit in on the correct terminal make sure it is secure so it won t slip off when the engine is activated later 8 x research source remember to match red to red and positive terminal to positive terminal when applying the red clamps connect a black clamp to the negative terminal on the donor battery retrieve the black clamp and bring it back to the live battery the black clamp fits directly on the terminal on the battery as long as it doesn t touch the terminal or red clamp you will be fine if you attach a clamp incorrectly stop before you start the cars remove the clamps carefully working 1 at a time to avoid touching them together clamp the other black lead to an unpainted metal surface in the car the black clamp does not connect to a battery terminal instead find a spot such as a clean bolt in the engine block you may also place the clamp on an unpainted part of the car s body underneath the hood 9 x research source avoid connecting this clamp to the dead battery unless you have no other choice this produces a spark that can ignite hydrogen fumes after the car is turned on don t dig too far down to find a metal surface the fuel lines are down there and you are better off keeping the clamp away from them make sure the jumper cable doesn t hang down into the engine compartment since it can get caught by the moving parts there start the donor vehicle and let it idle for a few minutes use the ignition key to start the engine the electrical systems such as the lights and radio will start while electricity flows to the dead battery give the battery at least 30 seconds to build power before you attempt to start the other car 10 x research source depending on the dead battery s age and condition it may require more time to charge step on the gas pedal to run the rpm up to about 3 000 if you want to drive more power towards the dead battery turn on the dead car s engine turn the key in the ignition to activate the car right away the electrical systems should activate if the lights radio or other electrical components don t come on you may need to give the battery more time shut off the car make sure the cables are attached properly and then try revving the working car to increase the power supply 11 x research source if the car doesn t start after repeated attempts your car may have a different problem it could have a blown fuse if the car s lights come on but the engine won t start the battery is fine you may hear the engine make a clicking noise as you try to start it this could be because of a faulty starter disconnect the jumper cables in reverse starting with the black clamps remove the cables in the exact opposite order from earlier start with the negative grounding cable you attached to a metal component remove the black clamp followed by the red clamp on the donor battery finish by removing the red clamp on the newly charged battery 12 x research source leave the car running so it has time to continue charging or else you will need to jump it again be careful when handling the cables make sure the clamps do not touch until all of them are removed from the batteries,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to remove an old car stereo,car stereos sometimes wear out or break and you need to swap out the old one for a replacement this might sound tricky but it s actually a pretty easy job all you need are a few simple tools and some patience once you know the right process then you ll be able to remove an old car stereo like a pro,disconnect the car battery to avoid a shock or short disconnecting the battery is an important safety precaution pop the hood and find the battery unscrew the nut on the negative terminal first and pull the wire off store it safely on one side of the hood then unscrew the positive terminal and move it to the other side of the hood make sure the positive terminal doesn t touch any metal parts of the car or it ll produce a spark 1 x research source car batteries commonly have a red clip on the positive terminal and a black clip on the negative terminal if the clips aren t color coded look for the or symbols never let the positive and negative wires touch remove any screws or bolts around the trim the trim is the plastic border around the stereo on some cars the stereo trim is just clipped on but others might have screws or bolts holding it on check around the border of the trim for anything attaching it to the dashboard unscrew the bolts or screws to free the trim 2 x research source if there are bolts or screws they might be near the bottom of the stereo trim so they re hidden from view keep track of any screw or bolts you remove so you can reattach the trim later on pop off the stereo trim with a flathead screwdriver whether the trim was attached with screws or not you can remove it the same way insert a flathead screwdriver under the trim and gently work around it to loosen it pull the trim off when it pops free 3 x research source if the trim is stuck you may have missed a screw or bolt double check and remove anything holding the trim down be careful when you re removing the trim if you crack it it might be expensive to replace pry the dashboard covering off if you have a newer car newer cars and suvs make it a bit more difficult to remove the stereo and might cover it with a whole dashboard panel instead of just a simple trim luckily this is easy to remove as well find the edge of the panel and insert a plastic prybar into the space work the prybar around the panel until it pops off then pull it off to reveal the stereo 4 x research source on some suvs the panel continue down to cover the cup holders this doesn t change the removal process just keep working around the panel with the prybar until it comes off 5 x research source do not use a screwdriver or metal tool to remove the dashboard panel this can crack the plastic and you ll need an expensive replacement you can get a plastic prybar from an auto parts store locate the slots on either side of the stereo car stereos are held in by 2 clips 1 on each side you can access them by inserting thin tools into the slots on both sides of the stereo check alongside the stereo and look for 2 thin slits to find the spot you have to insert the tool 6 x research source if the slots sit further back you might need a flashlight to see them some pickup trucks and suvs have 2 holes on each side instead of a thin slot in this case you ll need a 2 pronged tool or wire to access the stereo clips 7 x research source always confirm the process to remove the radio in your car owner s manual insert radio keys into the slots on either side of the stereo radio keys are small flat tools that undo the clips holding the stereo in they may come with your car or you can get a set from an auto parts store slide a key into each slot on either side of the stereo 8 x research source you need both keys in at the same time to release the stereo if you don t have radio keys you can use any flat piece of metal that fits into the radio slots some choices include thin knives files or hangers radio keys are sometimes called din tools if you re looking in an auto parts store press the keys until they click continue inserting the radio keys into the slots until you hear a click this means that you ve released the clips holding the radio in 9 x research source if you don t hear a click but the keys stop moving then they re probably inserted enough you should be able to pull the stereo out keep the keys inserted while you take the radio out if you remove them the clips will clamp back down remove the screws and bolts around the stereo if it doesn t use clips newer cars bolt the stereo in instead of using clips if you don t see any spaces to insert the keys around the radio then check in the corners for screws or bolts if you find these use a philips head screwdriver or socket wrench to remove them to free the stereo 10 x research source keep track of the screws and bolts you remove so you can put the radio back in slide the stereo body out of the socket grab the stereo by its outer edge and pull it straight back continue sliding it until it comes out of the radio socket be careful not to drop it once it s free 11 x research source you might have to jiggle the radio a bit to work it out of position don t keep pulling once the radio comes out because it s still plugged in unplug the stereo to complete the removal there are usually at least 2 plugs in the back of the stereo the antenna connects to the right side this plug pops out normally so just pull it out on the left side the electrical wires attach with a clamp squeeze the clamp to release it then pull those wires out the stereo is now completely free 12 x research source there might be other wires attached to the back of the stereo as well pull these out as needed to get the stereo out,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to take your guitar on a plane,if you re worried about whether or not you can take your guitar on a plane or whether it would survive travelling as checked luggage don t worry it s actually your legal right to carry a guitar in the cabin of a plane with no extra fees provided that you follow some guidelines regarding size and safety in order to avoid any at gate arguments you can print out and carry sec 403 of the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 which describes how you are allowed to travel with a guitar on a plane note that there will always be exceptions such as when you re flying on a small plane that just simply doesn t have room onboard for your guitar,book a seat at the back of the plane in order to board first people at the back of the plane usually get to board first so you re less likely to have problems finding space in the overhead bins choose a seat as far back in the plane as is available when you re purchasing your ticket to make the process of storing your guitar onboard easier 1 x research source if you re purchasing an extra seat for your guitar instead of storing it in an overhead luggage compartment it doesn t matter whether the seats are towards the back or not bring your guitar as standard carry on luggage if it fits in an overhead bin sec 403 of the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 permits passengers to carry guitars and other instruments in a plane s cabin as long as it will fit in normal luggage storage bins ensure your guitar is not longer or wider than the airline s overhead bins before you travel with it if you want to carry it on at no extra cost 2 x research source you can call an airline s customer service line to verify the exact overhead bin size for your flight note that there must be space in the overhead bins at the time you board the plane or the airline can require that you check it at the gate flight attendants won t remove other luggage to make space for your guitar try to carry your guitar as discreetly as possible when you re boarding your flight to avoid getting hassled by the agents at the gate ask a flight attendant if you can store your guitar in a coat closet there are often coat closets at the front and back of a plane that flight attendants store things in politely explain to a flight attendant that you re worried about your guitar getting damaged during the flight and ask if there is any extra room in a closet to store it upright 3 x research source you can also try this option if there s no overhead room when you re boarding your flight and the gate attendants are telling you that you can t take your guitar on keep in mind that flight attendants are not required to store your guitar in a closet so if they do so they re doing you a kind favor don t fight with the flight attendants if they won t put it in a closet for you you won t achieve anything this way place your guitar carefully into an overhead bin if you can t put it in a closet head to your seat and put your guitar horizontally into the closest available overhead bin place it on top of other passengers overhead luggage if the bins are already filling up and keep an eye out to make sure nobody puts anything on top of it 4 x research source if you re having trouble fitting your guitar into partially filled luggage bins politely ask nearby passengers if you can accommodate their luggage differently in order to fit your guitar in buy a ticket for your guitar if you can t take it as carry on luggage purchase an additional ticket for an adjacent seat and take your guitar on the plane as if it s a person in the seat next to you this is the only way you re allowed to take a large guitar on a plane with you that is too big to fit in an overhead bin 5 x research source if you aren t sure whether your guitar will fit in an overhead bin this is the safest way to avoid problems when you re boarding the flight naturally this isn t always going to be realistic especially if your flight is expensive other options you can consider are getting a smaller cheaper guitar just for travel or shipping your guitar to your destination use a soft case to make your guitar fit into cabin storage more easily place your guitar in a soft gig style case to minimize its footprint for travel these types of cases don t usually add a lot of bulk so your guitar will still be able to fit into an overhead bin 6 x research source these types of cases will also make your guitar less conspicuous when you carry it on you re less likely to get hassled by a gate attendant or flight attendant while you re bringing it onboard that way if you want a little extra protection you can get a fortified gig case these are still soft but have a little more form and structure to help pad your guitar during its journey keep in mind they are also a little bulkier than totally soft cases your guitar legally must be covered in order for you to take it on a plane as carry on luggage this is required in order to prevent injury to other passengers put your guitar in a hard travel case if you have to put it in the cargo hold choose the hardest sturdiest case possible for your guitar if it s too big to put in an overhead bin and you don t want to pay for an extra seat this will provide the most protection while it s being tossed around by baggage handlers and stored in the hold with other luggage 7 x research source for example if you called your airline and found out that your guitar is too big for your flight s overhead bins or if you re flying on a small commuter plane put it in a hard case if you plan to fly with your guitar a lot invest in a heavy duty flight case these cases are expensive but they are made of very hard reinforced materials and have a lot of foam padding for maximum protection pack your guitar with paper to fill extra space and stop it from moving loosen the strings slightly and put crumpled up newspaper or packing paper in between the strings and the fretboard wrap newspaper or packing paper around the headstock neck and heel to protect them fill in any empty spaces in the case with paper as well 8 x research source you could also use soft items of clothing like t shirts instead of paper doing so can even save you a little room in your other luggage bubble wrap would also work well for this avoid putting any prohibited objects inside your guitar case with the guitar remove anything from the case that is not allowed inside a plane s cabin don t put anything in the case that you wouldn t put in a normal piece of carry on luggage to avoid problems with airport security 9 x research source for example anything sharp bottles of liquids over 3 oz 88 7 ml and lighters are things that are prohibited from plane cabins ensure the total weight of your guitar is within the airline s limit the standard cabin luggage weight limit is 165 lb 75 kg so your guitar won t be overweight for a standard commercial flight weigh your guitar in its case to make sure that it falls under the airline s weight limit if your flight has a lower limit 10 x research source you can call your airline s customer service line ahead of time or look on their website to find the exact weight restrictions for your specific flight you are probably only likely to have problems with weight if you are flying on an extremely small plane since no guitars weigh anywhere near 165 lb 75 kg,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to open a headlight of a car,if you want to black out or customize your headlights you ll have to take them apart to access the interior headlights are sealed with a glue like sealant which can make them more difficult to open luckily you only need a few tools and an oven to break the seal around the housing as long as you use low heat and handle the headlight carefully you ll be able to open it without breaking it just be sure to reseal the headlight when you re finished so it doesn t develop any moisture damage,open your vehicle s hood find the lever or button that pops the hood inside your vehicle on the driver s side pull the lever or push the button down until you hear the latch on the hood click open lift the hood up completely so it doesn t fall down while you re working 1 x research source consult with your vehicle s manual if you have trouble finding how to open the hood remove the bumper cover if it s in the way of the headlight the bumper cover is the long body panel on the front of your vehicle that hides the metal bumper if the bumper cover overlaps your headlights locate the bolts holding the cover to the body along the top edge use a socket wrench to rotate the bolts counterclockwise until you can pull them out then look underneath the bumper cover and unscrew any of the bolts there push a flathead screwdriver into the seams between the cover and the wheel wells to expose the hidden bolts so you can loosen them lift the bumper cover up and pull it away from your vehicle to remove it 2 x research source consult with your vehicle s manual if you have any trouble finding the bolts on your bumper cover unscrew the bolts holding the headlight assembly in place look along the top edge of the headlight assembly to find 2 or 3 bolts securing it to your vehicle place a socket wrench over the bolt head and turn it counter clockwise to loosen it continue unscrewing the remaining bolts so the headlight moves around freely 3 x research source there may be 1 or 2 bolts along the bottom or side of the headlight as well unplug the connectors attached to the back of the headlight to remove it wiggle the headlight loose and pull it straight out from your vehicle so you can reach your hand behind it follow the wires coming from your vehicle leading to the back of the headlight find the square block connectors holding the wires and carefully pull them apart once you remove the 1 or 2 connectors you can easily pull the headlight completely out of your vehicle 4 x research source some wires will still hang out from the back of the headlight when you remove it don t try to force the headlight out of your vehicle or else you may damage the connectors remove any screws from the headlight set your headlight upside down on a towel or soft surface so you don t scratch the lens look around the edges of the headlight to find all of the screws holding the lens to the backing turn the screws counterclockwise with a screwdriver to remove them set the screws in a small cup so you don t misplace them 5 x research source double check for screws after you think you ve removed them all if you still have screws in the headlight when you try to open it you could crack or break the lens some headlights may not have screws meaning the lens and backing are only held together with adhesive sealant disconnect the bulbs from the headlight backing locate the backs of the bulbs screwed into the circular ports in the backing pinch the base of the bulb and turn it counter clockwise to make it loose pull the bulb straight out from the backing and set it aside somewhere where it won t get damaged remove any other bulbs in the headlight using the same process 6 x research source you do not have to remove the bulbs if you re not able to you can leave the rubber housing caps attached since the headlight reaches a similar temperature when it s in use the caps won t melt 7 x research source put on disposable gloves and old clothes after you heat up the headlight the sealant will be extremely sticky and adhere to anything it touches wear a pair of disposable work gloves so you don t get any of the sealant on your skin then put on an old shirt that you don t mind getting dirty just in case sealant gets on it 8 x research source you may want to wear a pair of heat resistant gloves underneath your disposable gloves so it s easier to handle the headlight preheat your oven to 220 250 f 104 121 c make sure your oven is large enough to hold the headlight so it doesn t touch the sides move the oven rack to the lowest height before turning your oven on let it preheat completely before you place your headlight inside 9 x research source if you don t have access to an oven you can also use a heat gun and a cardboard box get a box that s large enough to hold your headlight cut a circular hole in the bottom corner that s the same size as the heat gun s nozzle place the heat gun through the hole and turn it on to 250 f 121 c to heat inside the box 10 x research source avoid using the heat gun by hand since you won t heat the sealant evenly and could risk breaking the headlight assembly 11 x research source set the headlight on wood planks inside your oven wood doesn t hold heat as well as metal so it s perfect for keeping your headlight safe when you bake it use 2 in 4 in 5 1 cm 10 2 cm boards that are short enough to fit inside your oven lay the planks on the oven rack and set your headlight inside make sure the headlight doesn t touch the rack or sides of the oven directly or else it could melt 12 x research source if you don t have pieces of wood you can also use a cookie sheet lined with 1 2 layers of baking paper your headlight will not get damaged from the heat as long as it doesn t make contact with metal leave the headlight in your oven for 15 minutes keep the door closed while you re baking the headlight so the heat can circulate around it after 5 10 minutes check your headlight to make sure it hasn t shifted or fallen off of the planks after 15 minutes use oven mitts to remove the headlight from the oven so you can start working on it 13 x research source pop the tabs holding the lens to the headlight backing locate the plastic tabs that hold the lens to the backing around the edges of your headlight lift each tab up with your fingers to separate the 2 pieces of your headlight if you have trouble peeling them apart by hand position a pry bar or flathead screwdriver under the tab and pry it up work your way around the entire perimeter until you ve undone all the tabs 14 x research source be gentle with the tabs or else they ll break and your headlight won t stay together as well pry the lens off of the backing with a flathead screwdriver position the tip of your screwdriver in the bottom corner of your headlight so it s in the seam between the clear lens and headlight backing carefully push the screwdriver into the seam and tilt the handle down toward the backing to lift the lens out from the adhesive after you make a small gap try gently pulling the pieces apart by hand if you need to work the screwdriver around the seam to separate the pieces 15 x research source the sealant will harden as it cools down and make it more difficult to pull the headlight apart if you need to place the headlight back in your oven for another few minutes to soften it again be careful not to scratch the headlight lens with the tip of your screwdriver scrape the old sealant off of the backing with your screwdriver place the tip of your screwdriver in the channel around the edge of the headlight backing run the screwdriver around the entire perimeter of the backing to work out as much sealant as you can wipe the screwdriver clean as it gets dirty so it doesn t get stuck 16 x research source removing sealant works best while it s still warm and malleable if the sealant solidified try putting the backing in your oven for another 5 minutes to soften it avoid leaving the old sealant in the headlight since it may form air bubbles and won t seal properly make your modifications to your headlight once you have your headlight assembly open you can easily access the interior parts so you can customize them if you want to black out your headlights tape off the reflectors and areas you don t want to get paint on then use black spray paint to coat the backing 17 x research source if you want to install halo lights attach the light kit around the edges of the backing and run the wires through one of the holes or seams in the backing so you can attach them to your vehicle 18 x research source if you need to wire new lights to your vehicle s electrical system make sure to disconnect the battery first so you don t shock yourself press new butyl sealant into the channel on the headlight backing butyl sealant is a flexible rubber material that s used to make an airtight seal so moisture can t get into the lights tear off a piece of the sealant and press it into the channel with your fingers continue running the strip of sealant around the outer edge of the backing so it s flush with the surface once you ve gone completely around the channel cut the piece of sealant and press the edges down 19 x research source you can buy butyl sealant online or from an automotive parts store butyl sealant is stretchy and malleable so you can mold it into the channel until it fits perfectly preheat your oven to 275 f 135 c place the oven rack on the bottom position so there s enough room for air to circulate around your headlight turn the oven on to 275 f 135 c and let it heat up completely before you put your headlight inside 20 x research source set the backing in the oven for 10 15 minutes to soften the sealant place the headlight on wood planks inside your oven so the channel with sealant faces up close the oven door and leave the backing inside for at least 10 minutes the sealant will become more malleable and slightly melt to fill in any air bubbles after 10 15 minutes pass take the headlight out of your oven 21 x research source avoid setting the headlight directly on the rack or against the sides of your oven or else the plastic could melt screw the lens onto the backing align the lens with the channel in the backing and press it down firmly to reseal the light take the screws you removed from the backing earlier and feed them through the holes in the holes in the backing turn the screws clockwise with a screwdriver until they re tight to secure the headlight assembly 22 x research source it s okay if some of the sealant drips out from the channel when you reinsert the lens just wipe off the excess with a paper towel or scrape it off with your screwdriver clamp the backing and lens together so it doesn t shift place the first clamps in the corners of the headlight to hold the lens in place then place 1 or 2 more clamps on each side of the headlight so they re evenly spaced this helps ensure the lens sets in the right place without it slipping 23 x research source make sure the clamps are heat resistant or made from metal so they re safe to put in your oven put the headlight back in your oven for 5 minutes to seal it set the headlight back on the wood planks and keep it in your oven to let the sealant fill in around the lens after 5 minutes pull the headlight back out of the oven and let it rest until it s cool 24 x research source reattach the bulbs to the backing once the headlight feels cool to the touch feed the bulbs back through the ports in the backing push the bulb in as far as it will go before turning it clockwise to secure it in place screw in any remaining bulbs until you ve completely assembled the headlight again 25 x research source use new bulbs if you don t want to worry about the old ones burning out connect the headlight back to your vehicle pop the hood open on your vehicle and hold your headlight assembly near its port plug the connectors into the headlight s backing again to reconnect it to power push the headlight into position and secure it to your vehicle with bolts reattach any other pieces you had to remove from your vehicle to finish your repair 26 x research source after plugging in the connectors try starting your vehicle s battery and turn on your headlights to make sure they work properly if they don t then there may be an issue with the

how to tie down a street bike on a trailer,when riding your street bike from point a to b isn t an option the next best way to get it there is to transport it on a trailer make sure you have the proper equipment including a ramp step stool and high quality ratchet tie down straps you ll also want an extra pair of hands to spot you and help you load your bike onto the trailer once you have all these things ready to go it s a relatively straightforward process to load and tie down your street bike so you can take it on the road safely and securely,park your trailer on flat even ground with room to maneuver your bike pick somewhere flat and even to load your street bike onto the trailer park your trailer so that it is as level as possible and you have plenty of room to load the bike on 1 x research source for instance if you re loading your street bike onto a trailer from your home s garage and you have a flat driveway back the trailer straight into the driveway you can use either a specialized motorcycle trailer or any kind of flatbed equipment trailer to transport a road bike you can follow the same steps to transport a bike in the back of a pickup truck set up a motorcycle loading ramp in line with the wheel chock in the trailer place 1 end of the loading ramp directly behind the trailer s wheel chock on the edge of the trailer bed and the other end on the ground use the ramp s safety chains or straps to secure it to the back of the trailer so it doesn t slip while you re loading your bike 2 x research source a wheel chock is a frame attached to the bed of some motorcycle trailers that keeps the front wheel of a bike from moving while it s being transported if your trailer doesn t have a wheel chock you can get one online for under 100 usd and bolt it to the bed of your trailer if you aren t using a trailer with a wheel chock just place the ramp in the middle you buy a steel motorcycle loading ramp online for under 100 usd hook 1 ratchet tie down strap to an anchor point near each corner of the trailer find 2 secure anchor points near the front of the trailer such as attached d rings or holes in the metal frame and hook a ratchet tie down strap to each one attach 2 more straps to 2 secure anchor points at the back of the trailer 3 x research source depending on the model of trailer you re using there might be rings or holes on the frame or in the bed that are meant to be used as anchor points if there aren t rings or holes to use for anchor points you can hook the straps to a solid metal part of the frame any kind of strong canvas ratchet tie down straps will work for this avoid using cam buckle straps because they are less reliable and can come loose place a step stool to the left of the ramp close to the back of the trailer set a sturdy step stool on the ground to the left of the ramp but close enough that you will be able to comfortably wheel the bike up the ramp position it close enough to the back of the trailer that you will be able to use it to easily step up into the trailer 4 x research source if you don t have a step stool you can use something strong and sturdy like a turned over milk crate if your trailer is low enough that you can easily step up into it from the ground you don t need a step stool line your street bike up with the ramp with a spotter behind it hold your bike by the handlebars and stand to the left of it push it up to the bottom of the loading ramp so the front wheel of the bike is lined up straight with the ramp get a helper to stand behind the bike with both hands on the back of the bike 5 x research source never try to ride your bike up a ramp to load it into a trailer it s very easy for an accident to happen this way and you re likely to damage your bike or get hurt push the bike up the ramp slowly in 1 continuous motion start pushing the bike up the ramp using the handlebars while your helper pushes it straight up from behind step up onto the step stool when you reach it then step up again into the trailer continuing to push the bike up the ramp the whole time 6 x research source don t stop pushing the bike in the middle of the ramp or it can start rolling back down again roll the bike s front wheel into the trailer s wheel chock if it has one keep pushing the bike straight once you get it all the way up the ramp and into the trailer push it until the front wheel is securely in the wheel chock and the bike won t move forward any farther 7 x research source if your trailer doesn t have a wheel chock push the bike forward until the front wheel is against the front wall of the trailer bed don t put your kickstand down when you re done putting the bike into place because it can easily damage the bed of your trailer or get broken if you hit bumps or potholes have your spotter keep holding the bike straight and steady while you tie it down hook the 2 front tie down straps over the bike s handlebars place the hooks of the front straps over the metal part of the handlebars on each side avoid wires cables and any other soft parts of the handlebars that the hooks could damage 8 x research source never hook your tie down straps over anything that could bend or break always use hard strong metal parts of your bike to secure the straps to ratchet the front straps tight until all the slack is out starting at the left tighten the left front strap until it is slack free repeat this for the right front strap so the bike is sitting straight upright and there is no slack in either of the front straps 9 x research source avoid over tightening the straps the goal is to get them tight enough that there is no slack but not so tight that your bike can t absorb some shock when you go over a bump which could damage its suspension seals attach the 2 rear tie down straps to the bike s passenger pegs or rear frame pick a secure piece of metal like the passenger pegs or rear subframe at the back of your bike to hook the rear straps to hook the ends of the straps over your chosen fixing points and make sure they won t slip off 10 x research source don t pick anywhere too low on the bike to attach the straps it s best if they are at about a 45 degree angle from the bike down to the anchor points on the trailer tighten the rear straps while your helper compresses the rear suspension have your assistant press down on the back of the bike to compress its rear suspension ratchet both of the back straps tight until there is no slack in either of them 11 x research source once your helper lets up on the rear suspension the back of the bike will rise up and add tension to the rear straps to keep it extra secure remember not to tighten the straps so much that the bike s suspension will remain all the way compressed it still needs to be able to absorb some shock when you drive over bumps or rough terrain check to make sure all the tie downs are tight and the bike doesn t move pull on each of the 4 straps to make sure they are tight and there is no slack in any of them make sure the bike doesn t rock back and forth or side to side make any final adjustments to the straps as needed until everything is secure 12 x research source it s a good idea to check the straps periodically while you re on the road as well for example if you stop for food coffee gas or a bathroom break hop in the trailer and double check everything again put 1 2 straps across the top of the bike if you ll be driving over rough terrain hook an additional ratchet strap onto an anchor point on each side of the trailer so it s going directly across the seat of the bike ratchet the strap all the way tight for additional safety stability add a second safety strap if you want to be extra secure 13 x research source for example if you re going to be transporting your road bike over bumpy off road terrain or on particularly windy roads an extra strap or 2 for stability could be a good idea this isn t usually necessary if you re taking the trailer

how to take stickers off a bike,stickers and decals are pretty standard for a lot of bikes and motorcycles but they can become an eyesore after a while some stickers may be a bit more stubborn than others but you can get any adhesive off your bike with some common household supplies and a bit of elbow grease set aside a few minutes to clean off your bike so it ll be completely clean before your next ride,spray over the sticker with adhesive remover or lubricant spritz the entire surface of the sticker or decal so it s a little easier to peel up if you don t have any adhesive remover on hand feel free to use something like wd 40 a common lubricant 1 x research source you can find adhesive remover at most stores that sell cleaning supplies if your adhesive remover doesn t come in a spray bottle feel free to pour it into a spray bottle so it s easier to apply double check the safety instructions on the spray before you spritz anything onto your bike heat the surface of the sticker with a hairdryer for at least 5 seconds plug in a hairdryer near your bike and set the device to low or high heat hold the end of the hairdryer at least 1 in 2 5 cm away from the surface of the bike which will allow the glue from the sticker to start melting hover over the sticker for at least 5 seconds if you re dealing with a large sticker or decal you may need to apply heat for a few more seconds seconds 2 x research source if you re working in a garage or outdoor area you may need to use an extension cord to heat up your bike peel away the sticker once it s warm to the touch pinch the corner of the sticker with 2 fingers pull lightly on this corner dragging it up and away from the surface of the bike keep in mind that some stickers may come off easily while others may need a bit more elbow grease it all depends on the size and manufacturer of the sticker 3 x research source for instance a large decal will likely be harder to remove than a regular small sticker reheat the sticker if you re having trouble peeling it off turn on your hair dryer again and hover it at least 1 in 2 5 cm above the sticker or decal in question heat up the sticker for at least 5 more seconds then try peeling it again continue peeling away the sticker until it s completely removed from the bike 4 x research source you may need to reheat your sticker a couple of times which is completely normal touch the surface of the bike to see if it s still sticky tap your finger along the portion of the bike where the sticker used to be after touching the surface determine if the metal feels sticky or smooth if the surface is still sticky you ll want to clean it off before you start biking again 5 x research source depending on the sticker there may be a lot of leftover adhesive soak the surface of a rag with lighter fluid or adhesive remover squirt a blueberry sized amount of lighter fluid or adhesive remover onto the surface of an old rag keep in mind that lighter fluid is less harsh than some adhesive removers so you don t have to worry about the finish being damaged at all 6 x research source any old rag can work for this or a paper towel always work with lighter fluid in a well ventilated area away from any sources of heat or fire 7 x research source scrub away any leftover residue from the bike rub over the entire portion of the bike where the sticker used to be with the rag continue rubbing over the surface until it s completely smooth to the touch if needed blot the metal dry with a clean rag or paper towel 8 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to remove a fat bike tire,a fat bike is a type of mountain bike that has fatter tires designed to grip soft unstable terrain such as snow and sand just like regular mountain bikes fat bikes can end up with a flat tire in which case you ll have to remove the tire and replace the inner tube you might also want to change the tires one day when the tread wears out or to swap out the style of tread you ride with for instance you could get studded fat bike tires for riding in the snow no matter what the reason you want to remove your fat bike s tire is the process is relatively straightforward and you don t need any special tools to get the job done,disconnect the brake cable if you have v brakes or cantilever brakes squeeze the brake arms together by hand lift up the cable housing called the noodle to disconnect the cable from the brake arms 1 x research source this is not necessary if you have disc brakes put your bike up on a bike stand if you have one to make the task of removing the wheel much easier shift the chain to the smallest sprocket if you re removing the back wheel use your shifters to move the chain down to the smallest gear sprocket this will loosen the chain so you can take the wheel off 2 x research source you don t have to do this if you re removing the front wheel remove the wheel from the fork that it attaches to flip down the quick release lever if your bike has one or use a crescent wrench to remove the nuts if your wheel is attached with nuts unhook the chain from the gear sprocket and carefully pull the wheel out of the fork 3 x research source if you re removing the back wheel press or pull down the derailleur which is the mechanism that attaches the shifter cables to the gears as you pull the wheel off if you have your bike up on a bike stand make sure to hold the wheel while you loosen the quick release or the nuts so it doesn t fall out and potentially get damaged unscrew the cap and the valve nut from the air valve turn the cap counterclockwise until you loosen it all the way then pull it off and set it aside where you won t lose it do the same for the valve nut which is the small ring at the base of the air valve where it meets the inside of the wheel s rim 4 x research source the air valve is attached to the inner tube so you won t be able to pull the tire off if you don t remove the cap and the valve nut first pry the tire off the rim stick your fingertips underneath the tire and start pulling it off the rim slide your fingers around the wheel keeping them between the tire and the rim until the tire comes all the way off the rim 5 x research source fat bike tires are looser than regular mountain bike tires so you don t usually need a tire lever to pry them off the rims if your fat bike tire is too tight to take off the rim with just your fingertips insert a tire lever in between the rim and the tire then use it like a lever to pry the tire off pull the inner tube out of the tire the inner tube is the inflatable tube inside the hollow tread of the tire reach inside your fat bike s tire and grab this tube then pull it out and set it aside 6 x research source this is the part that actually goes flat when you get a flat tire when something long enough pierces the tread of your tire it can puncture this inner tube if this happens replace the inner tube inspect the inside of the tire and the rims for sharp debris and remove it examine the entire inside of the tire s tread for anything stuck in it that could cause a flat such as glass nails or other sharp debris check along the entire rim where the tire sits for anything sharp that is stuck to it as well remove any debris you find to avoid future flats 7 x research source if you don t see anything with a visual inspection put on a thick work glove to protect your hand and feel along the inside of the tire for anything sharp sometimes debris can be too small to notice with the naked eye inflate a replacement tube until it starts to take and hold its shape take the cap off the new inner tube s air valve and use a bike pump to inflate it about halfway or until it starts to hold it s round shape this will make it easier to put it inside the tire s tread 8 x research source if you inflate the tube all the way you won t be able to get it back in the tire and onto the wheel easily inflating it only partially makes it more flexible and easier to work with push the inner tube back inside the tire tread stick the tube into any part of the inside of the tire s tread to get started rotate the tread and keep pressing the inner tube inside of it as you turn the tire until it s inserted all the way 9 x research source it doesn t matter what part of the tire you start putting the inner tube inside of you basically just have to shove it all in there s no special technique if you want to swap your fat bike s tread out put the new tube inside a new tire at this point instead of back into the old one put the tire back on the rim and reattach the valve nut line up the tire with the rim so the tread is going forward find the air valve hole on the rim and line it up with the tire s air valve stick the air valve through the hole then screw the valve nut back on to hold the tire in place on the rim work your way around the tire and press the rubber inside the edges of the rim 10 x research source most fat bike tires are marked with arrows that show you which way the tread is supposed to go fill the tire with air slowly until it is the rest of the way inflated use your bike pump to finish inflating the tire put the air valve cap back on and tighten it all the way when you re finished filling the tire with air 11 x research source keep an eye on the tire as you inflate it to make sure the rubber stays inside the rim this is why it s best to fill the tire slowly set the tire back into your fat bike s fork position the wheel with the tread going forward and set it in the fork reattach the nuts using a crescent wrench if the wheel has nuts or flip the quick release lever back into place to secure the wheel 12 x research source if you re attaching the rear wheel remember to push down the derailleur mech in order to get the wheel back on the fork put the chain back on the smallest sprocket if you re attaching the rear wheel use your fingers to loop the chain back over the smallest gear sprocket try shifting the gears using your bike s shifters to make sure the chain is attached properly and works correctly 13 x research source you might have to jiggle the derailleur mechanism around a bit to get the chain over the sprocket connect the brake cable if you have v brakes or cantilever brakes squeeze the brake arms together to spread them apart at the top push the brake cable housing back in between the arms and release them test out your brakes to make sure they are working before you ride 14 x research source you don t have to do anything to the brakes if you have disc brakes,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to open a stuck car door,car doors can get stuck due to a variety of reasons if your car door is stuck in the locked position it might be a simple matter of unjamming the door s locking mechanism to get it working smoothly again on the other hand if you can t seem to get your door open from either side there could be internal structural damage that is causing it to stick shut try a few different techniques to unstick the locking mechanism first then move on to inspecting the inside of the door for damage that needs to be fixed if you still can t get it open if all else fails get your door professionally repaired by a mechanic or an auto locksmith,attempt all methods of unlocking the door try using your remote and key to see if either of those will unlock the door check if you can unlock and open the door from the inside if the key and remote don t work 1 x research source if your key works but the remote doesn t you might just have a bad electrical connection you can get this repaired by an auto electrician try lubricating the lock with a dry lubricant spray if the key is sticking use the tip of your key to push open the door s keyhole slot spray a dry lubricant spray directly into the keyhole for a few seconds to lubricate it and loosen up the lock attempt to use your key to unlock the door again after you lubricate it 2 x research source go ahead and try this fix if your door won t open when you try turning the key in the lock which can be a sign of a sticking lock mechanism an example of a dry lubricant you can use is something called ptfe spray which is a dust resistant dry lubricant spray wet lubricants can attract dirt and dust that will clog up your door s locking mechanism even more so avoid using anything like grease or oil try putting some dry lubricant powder such as graphite powder on both sides of your key before you use it in the lock as an alternative or in addition to using a dry lubricant spray spray wd 40 into the lock to clean out rust and grime if lubricant didn t work poke the tip of your key into the keyhole to open up the slot again stick the red straw nozzle tip of a can of wd 40 all the way into the keyhole and spray it inside the lock until it starts dripping out 3 x research source wd 40 will blast away dirt rust and other substances that could be causing the moving parts of your door s locking mechanism to stick add some dry lubricant to the lock again after you clean it out with wd 40 to lubricate it for your key remove the door panel and try moving the locking mechanism if it s still stuck locate the screws and plastic plugs that hold the door s panel in place and remove them with a screwdriver and pliers pull off the door panel and locate the locking mechanism which is a collection of metal rods plastic fasteners and moving plates right below the door s lock move the mechanism manually by wiggling the metal rods and plates up and down to see if this unlocks the door 4 x research source there might also be a protective plastic cover underneath the door panel remove this as well if this is the case for your car now that you have the door panel open try cleaning off the whole locking mechanism with wd 40 especially if there is any visible rust or dirt that could be jamming it then apply some dry lubricant to the mechanism if moving the locking mechanism manually doesn t seem to unlock the door it might have internal structural damage and broken parts that need replacing take off the door panel and look inside for damaged parts remove the screws and plastic plugs that hold the car door panel in place then pull it off carefully so you can look inside inspect the locking mechanism below the door s lock and the door latch mechanism for broken loose or missing parts 5 x research source if you see a plastic cover underneath the door panel remove this as well to access the inner workings of the door the door latch mechanism is near the inside edge of the door where it opens and closes this is what actually hooks the door onto the door frame to keep it shut look for missing bolts if the door s outer handle is loose there is sometimes a bolt directly behind the outer handle on the inside of the car door that holds the handle in place and makes it work properly check the inside of the door behind the door s outside handle to see if it looks like this bolt is missing and put a new bolt on in place if necessary 6 x research source this mainly applies if the door works fine from the inside but you can t get it open from the outside because the outer handle is loose there might be a deep hole in the metal panel of the inside of the door where this bolt is hidden behind the outer handle if you can t tell use a flashlight or the flashlight on your phone to look in all the holes you see and try to find any missing bolts fix any broken or loose metal rods you will see several metal rods inside the door that attach to the locking and latching mechanisms look closely to see if any of these rods are popped out of the holes or clips that they are supposed to sit in or if they are bent or broken in some way stick them back into the holes or clips if they are just loose buy replacement rods pull out the damaged ones and snap the new ones into place if any rods are broken 7 x research source if you don t notice any obviously damaged rods try pulling the door handle or locking and unlocking the door s lock while you look at the metal rods you should see the metal rods moving so if any of them are just staying still take a closer look at whether they are loose or broken if any of the rods are bent and that s why they are out of place try bending them straight again using a pair of pliers then snap them back into the holes or clips that are meant to hold them if you need to replace any of the rods you can get cheap replacement parts for many common types of cars at a scrapyard you could also try improvising a replacement with something like a metal coat hanger replace any broken plastic fasteners the metal rods that make your door s locking and latching mechanisms work are usually held in place by plastic clips look at all of the plastic bits you can see to spot any that are damaged buy replacement fasteners pull off the old ones and replace them with the new ones if you find broken pieces 8 x research source as with the metal rods you can often get these small replacement bits at a junkyard you can also try looking for them online though you might have to buy more pieces than just the ones you need if you purchase replacements online as an alternative to replacing broken plastic fasteners try binding the metal rod that a broken fastener is meant to hold to the remaining part of the broken plastic using super glue or epoxy put a dab of glue on the plastic then press the tip of the metal rod against it for as long as your chosen glue says it takes for the adhesive to cure,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to increase bike reach,if your neck shoulders or upper back get sore when you ride your bike you may have a problem with your bicycle s reach a bike s reach is the horizontal distance from the head tube which is just below the top of your handles to the bottom bracket which is the tube that connects your pedals to the bike while you cannot technically change a bike s reach since the head tube and bottom bracket are in fixed locations you can artificially increase your reach by adjusting your seat or handlebars you can only move your reach so far so if the problem doesn t resolve itself after you ve changed your handlebars or raised your seat it may be time to get a newer bigger bike,purchase wider or longer handlebars to artificially increase the reach a bike s reach is determined by the frame and you cannot change it however you can artificially increase the reach by purchasing wider or longer handlebars this will force you to sit further forward while you bike which is effectively the same thing as buying a bike with a longer reach 1 x research source bike handles like other components on a bike are always measured in millimeters grab some calipers and open the jaws around an exposed portion of the handlebar near the center close the jaws and check where the adjustable jaw crosses the ruler at the top to measure your handlebars get wider handlebars if you have broad shoulders or you like holding the sides while you ride get longer handlebars if you like to keep your hands close to the stem while you ride the stem is the bracket in the middle of your frame that holds the handlebars in place changing your handlebars out is more work than adjusting the seat but you shouldn t mess with the saddle height if you re serious about riding and it s already at a comfortable height peel off the brake covers and unscrew the brakes with an allen wrench set your bike on your work stand carefully peel up the plastic or fabric cover on top of each brake where the cable inserts into the assembly every bike is different so take your time here and consult your instruction manual if you can t figure out how to remove these covers unscrew the bolt under this cover on each brake and gearshift to unlock the assemblies before sliding them off of your handles 2 x research source this process is identical on mountain and racing bikes the only difference may be that you ll need to remove the rubber grips on the end of mountain bikes first before doing anything else 3 x research source you may need to cut your grip tape and peel it off first before taking the brakes and gearshifts off if there isn t any slack in the cables and they re taped to the handlebars you can just let the brakes and gearshifts hang as you complete the rest of these steps unscrew the bolts on the faceplate that holds the handlebars on the stem stand in front of your front wheel and look at the junction where the handlebars meet the head tube there is a bracket with 4 hex bolts holding the faceplate on the stem grab an allen wrench that fits these bolts and unscrew them count the number of times that you unscrew each bolt so you can reattach the new handlebars with the same tension 4 x research source if you don t count the number of rotations required to undo each bolt you ll need to use a torque wrench with an allen key attachment to reinstall the bolts without breaking the stem the tension for these bolts should be listed in the bike s instruction manual if you have one but it s much easier to count the rotations and write them down as you remove the stem s bolts lubricate your bolts and oil the handlebars if they re carbon fiber if you bought carbon fiber handlebars lubricate the stem and the handlebars with fiber grip grab some lubricating grease and rub it around the threading of each bolt or screw you removed this will keep them from catching as you reinstall them with your new handlebars and reduce the odds that they break while you re riding 5 x research source you don t need to lubricate your handlebars if they re made of aluminum or some other material slide your new handlebars against the stem and reattach the faceplate take your new handlebars and hold them in place against the stem line the marks up on the center of the new handlebars to make sure they re centered against the edges of the stem hold the faceplate over the stem and screw each hex bolt back in tighten them half of the way to hold your handlebars in place 6 x research source be sure to screw each bolt in halfway if you had to unscrew each bolt 24 times to remove them put them back in by twisting 12 times this will make it easy to remember how many more rotations you need once you adjust the angle of the bars adjust the angle of the handlebars before tightening the bolts all the way the angle of the handlebars is entirely up to you for most serious cyclists the goal is for the top of the handlebars to be parallel to the ground when you ride so you can intuitively balance and guide the front wheel however many cyclists find higher handlebars more comfortable take the bike off of the work stand and adjust the angle by tilting the handlebars up or down by hand based on your personal preference once you re happy with how your handlebars are resting in the stem tighten the bolts on the front of the faceplate all the way 7 x research source don t tighten the bolts too hard if you overtighten them you could break your stem reattach the brakes to the handles by tightening the bolts slide each brake and gearshift back over the handles slide them up so that the brakes sit facing away from the saddle on the front of the handlebars line them up so that they re symmetrical on your handlebars and in a comfortable location where they re easy to grip once you re happy with the locations of the brakes and the gearshifts tighten the bolt on the top of each assembly to secure them to the handles 8 x research source slide or reinstall the covers on top of the brake and gearshift assembly on each side the same way you took them off wrap your new handlebars with handlebar tape use electrical tape to wrap the cables around the underside of your handlebars if you want to hide them grab a roll of handlebar tape and peel the end off wrap the end of the handlebar in 1 2 even layers then wrap the remainder of the handle using even equal wraps so that ½ of each layer overlaps with the previous length of tape repeat this process on the other handle so that your tape meets in the center of the faceplate 9 x research source if you purchased handlebars with rubber grips slide them over the handles and adjust them as needed until they fit the shape of each handlebar raise your bike seat to increase the angle you sit if you ride casually if you re a serious cyclist you shouldn t mess with the bike seat if it s already at the proper height however you can certainly increase the height of your seat to increase the reach if you don t particularly care about perfect riding conditions or you just casually use your bike to take short trips 10 x research source when you re on your bike and your feet are at the lowest point on the pedals your knee should be slightly bent this is the ideal height for your seat and changing its height will mess with the angle your feet rotate when you re pedaling so long as you can pedal comfortably it s fine to raise the seat unlock the seat post clamp to release the bike saddle look at the bar that connects your saddle to the seat tube which is the vertical tube that holds the seat post in place at the top of the seat tube there is a round clamp if there s a bolt on the back of this clamp use an allen wrench to turn it counterclockwise until the seat tube unlocks if there s a bar sticking out of this clamp just turn it away from the seat post by hand to unlock the seat post 11 x research source raise your seat post 2 5 7 6 centimetres 0 98 2 99 in to your desired height if your legs are normally comfortable when you bike it s best to not raise the seat post more than 7 6 centimetres 3 0 in just lift the seat up a little bit further than it used to sit to increase the reach artificially and hold the saddle in place 12 x research source by raising your butt further off of the ground you ll have to lean further forward to grab the handlebars this is effectively the same thing as extending your handlebars for your back and neck but raising your seat does change how far your legs have to extend to pedal if your knees lock at any point when you re pedaling the seat is too high and you ll have to lower it a little bit tighten the clamp to secure your seat post and lock it in place once you have the seat at its desired height tighten the bolt on the back of your seat post with your allen wrench to lock your saddle in place if you unlocked the seat post by hand just slide the metal tab that s sticking out of your bike back against the seat tube to lock your saddle 13 x research source upper back and neck pain are symptoms of a short reach however lower back and leg pain are signs that your seat is too high if you notice your upper back pain goes away and you start getting lower back pain you ll need to install bigger handles or get a new bike sit on the bike to see how it feels if you re looking to buy a new bike the best way to see if it s right for you is to sit on it first adjust the seat post so that the saddle rests at a height where your knees are slightly bent when your feet are at their lowest point on the pedals place your hands on the top of the handlebars or drops depending on how you ride keep your spine straight and take the bike for a short ride if it feels comfortable it may be a good fit for you 14 x research source if you don t feel comfortable when you take a bike for a test drive it s not an ideal bike for you when it comes to finding the right bike the common small medium large sizes are too simplistic to be helpful the popular usage of the top tube s length can be problematic since the top tubes on most bikes sit on an angle and aren t universal judging a bike by the reach solves part of this problem by using an imaginary point based on how you sit on the bike to see if it s right for you measure the reach with a measuring tape to see how long it is set the bike against a corner of the wall so that the handlebars sit against one wall and the back wheel sits against the adjacent wall take a measuring tape and measure the distance from the center of the pedals to the wall behind the back tire note this measurement then measure from the middle of the handlebars to the wall above the back tire subtract the first measurement from the second measurement to find the reach 15 x research source for example if the distance from the middle of the pedals to the back wall is 810 millimetres 32 in and the distance from the handlebars to the back wall is 1 270 millimetres 50 in the reach is 460 millimetres 18 in bike reach is always measured in millimeters so you ll need to convert the measurement if you aren t using the metric hash marks on your measuring tape use your height to determine if the reach falls in a comfortable range while a bike s reach is largely a matter of personal preference there are ideal ranges based on your height if a bike s reach falls within the range for your height you re more likely to feel comfortable as you ride check to see if the prospective bike will be comfortable for you 16 x research source height 157 168 centimetres 62 66 in ideal

how to choose a propeller for a boat,a new propeller can help you tweak the performance of your boat to suit your preferences the two main measurements of a boat propeller are diameter and pitch you can increase or decrease both the diameter and the pitch of your boat s prop to change how it performs the type of material it s made out of and the number of blades your propeller has are also things to consider when you re shopping for a new propeller remember that you can always consult the staff at a marine dealership to help you choose the right prop for your boat they ll usually even let you test out a few different props before you commit to buying,increase propeller diameter for more control and power propellers with a larger diameter give your boat more control and power but create more drag and decrease your acceleration choose a propeller with a greater diameter if you have a large boat that requires a lot of control and power 1 x research source for example if you have a big fishing boat and you haul a lot of gear regularly your boat could benefit from a propeller with a bigger diameter so it has more power to carry all the weight the diameter is the distance from the center of the prop to the tip of one of the blades multiplied by 2 drag is how much your boat acts like something is dragging it down which makes it go slower a prop that has too big of a diameter and water conditions are the 2 main things that can create drag decrease propeller diameter for more acceleration propellers with smaller diameters rotate faster thus creating more acceleration choose a propeller with a lesser diameter if you have a small boat that you want to get up to fast speeds 3 x research source for example sports cruisers can benefit from propellers with smaller diameters raise the pitch for higher top speeds pick a propeller with a higher pitch to increase the top speed of your boat keep in mind that a higher pitch will also decrease your boat s acceleration 4 x research source the pitch is the distance the propeller will theoretically move your boat with 1 full revolution of the shaft for example a 21 pitch prop will theoretically move your boat 21 in 53 cm with 1 complete rotation of the propeller pitch is theoretical because you have to be operating your boat in optimal conditions for the pitch to be 100 accurate for example water conditions wind and a boat s weight and design can cause a prop to slip which lowers the pitch heavy commercial boats usually rely on propellers with higher pitches lower the pitch for better acceleration propellers with lower pitches have higher rpms thus resulting in greater acceleration for your boat opt for a new propeller with a lower pitch if your goal is increasing the acceleration 5 x research source keep in mind that a lower pitch will also decrease the top speed of your boat a rule of thumb is that for every 1 in 2 5 cm less in the pitch the propeller will spin about 200 rpms faster light recreational boats typically use propellers with lower pitches select a stainless steel propeller for offshore boats stainless steel propellers are the highest performing and most durable type of boat prop choose a propeller made out of stainless steel if you have an offshore saltwater boat that you operate in deep waters 6 x research source stainless steel props are designed to provide the best performance but are expensive to repair or replace if you hit something that s why they are best used in deep water choose an aluminum propeller for river boats aluminum propellers are softer so it s possible to repair minor damage in them if you hit something in shallow water for example opt for a propeller made out of aluminum if you have a boat that you operate in rivers or other shallow waters 7 x research source since aluminum is a relatively soft metal if you hit something when you re boating in shallow water the propeller will get damaged instead of causing damage to the shaft or gears then you can either repair the propeller or buy a new one since they are less expensive than stainless steel props opt for a 3 blade prop for the most balanced performance propellers that have 3 blades provide the best all around performance pick a 3 blade propeller if you don t need a higher performance in certain areas so you ll get the best mix of acceleration lift speed and fuel efficiency 8 x research source for example if you just have a speed boat for everyday use a 3 blade prop can be a great choice get a 4 blade prop if you want better acceleration fuel efficiency and lift more blades translate into faster acceleration better fuel efficiency and more lift which is how high the boat hull lifts up out of the water when you re driving it choose a propeller with 4 blades if you want higher performance in these areas but keep in mind that it will often lower performance in other areas such as top speed 9 x research source for example if you have a heavy high performance boat like a large speed boat you might benefit from using a 4 blade propeller choose a 4 blade high diameter low pitch prop for a pontoon boat pontoon boats are not meant to handle high speeds and can benefit from 4 blade propellers because of the added surface area that makes the ride more responsive a bigger diameter and lower pitch will give the boat more control and power 11 x research source other terms you might come across are cup and rake angle cup is the curve on the edges of a prop s blades and rake angle is the degree of the slant on the blades these both affect a propeller s pitch so a low pitch prop will have a low cup and low rake angle either a stainless steel or aluminum prop can work for a pontoon boat depending on how deep the water you plan to operate it in is select a 3 blade low pitch high diameter prop for a deck boat deck boats are another type of boat that is not meant for high speeds so a prop with a low pitch is best because it will create a slower more controlled ride it s ok to go with a 3 blade prop to add a little more acceleration and speed than a 4 blade prop 12 x research source a 3 blade low pitch prop will still also have a low cup and a low rake angle depending on how deep the water you operate your deck boat in is a stainless steel or aluminum prop can both work pick a 3 or 4 blade prop with medium diameter and pitch for a ski boat a 3 or 4 blade propeller with both a moderate diameter and pitch will create a balanced ride for a ski boat this creates a good balance between speed and handling which are both important when you re driving this type of boat 13 x research source these types of propellers can have a moderate cupping and rake angle as well a stainless steel prop is best for a ski boat because they perform better and you will be likely be operating the boat in mostly deeper water opt for a high pitch low diameter stainless steel prop for a speed boat speed boats require the highest performing highest speed propellers a stainless steel prop with a high pitch and a low diameter will provide the most acceleration and speed 14 x research source this type of propeller will have a high cup and a high rake angle as well a 3 blade prop for a speed boat will usually offer the top speed performance for a speed boat another feature to look for in a speed boat propeller is thinner blades the thinner the blades are the less drag they create in the water which helps when you re going for top speed performance,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to make an engine stand,using an engine stand makes it easier to make modifications or repairs to the engine while it s out of your vehicle while you can buy an engine stand from a hardware store or an auto supply shop you can also make one yourself it s a relatively complicated task that requires a few specialized tools such as a circular saw mig welder and engine hoist however if you have all of the right tools and you know how to use them you can make an engine stand that will hold your engine safely and securely,use a 12 ft 3 7 m length of 1 inch 2 5 cm square steel tubing the frame of your stand needs to be strong enough to support the weight of your engine so go with 1 inch 2 5 cm square tubing made of 1045 alloy which is heavy duty enough for the project use a long length so you re able to cut it into sections 1 x research source you can find 1 inch 2 5 cm square tubing made of 1045 alloy at your local hardware or home improvement store square tubing is better for connecting the corners of your frame than circular tubing mark 2 30 in 76 cm and 5 20 in 51 cm lengths a stand that is 30 inches 76 cm long 20 inches 51 cm wide and 20 inches 51 cm tall will accommodate most engines so take your tape measure and measure the length of each section use a marker to make an even line across the tubing for each section 2 x research source it s very important that the sections are even and measured exactly so your stand will be balanced cut the square tubing to size with a circular saw use a circular saw with a blade that can cut through steel bring the blade to full speed and press it through the tubing to make clean even cuts at the marks that you made when you measured the sections 3 x research source make sure the blade is at full speed before you make your cuts to reduce the chance of the blade breaking and to make a clean cut put on welding gloves a helmet and protective clothing welding uses high heat to melt and connect metal together so it s important that you wear gloves specially designed for the task it also creates an extremely bright light that can damage your vision so put on a welding helmet with a visor to protect your eyes wear jeans and a long sleeved shirt so any sparks that are produced don t burn your skin 4 x research source attach 2 steel tabs to a 20 in 51 cm tube with a mig welder in order for your stand to hold the rear of the engine securely steel tabs need to be attached to the frame precisely where they ll fit onto the rods on the rear of your engine slide the tabs onto the 2 rods on the back of the engine place your tube against the bottom of the tabs and use a mig welder to weld the tabs onto the tubing then remove the tubing with the tabs attached from the engine 5 x research source be careful not to burn yourself or touch the metal while it s still hot after you attach the tabs because the location of the rods on the rear of the engine can vary based on the make and model placing the tabs on the engine itself ensures that the tabs are precisely measured you can find premade steel tabs at your local hardware store tack weld the corners of the frame together a tack weld is a quick weld designed to temporarily hold parts together so you can perform a final weld more effectively use a safe working surface such as a welding table or steel table and arrange the 30 in 76 cm tubes and the 20 in 51 cm tubes so the corners are connected and they form a large rectangle then use a mig welder to heat where the tubes connect to tack weld them together and form the base of your stand 6 x research source the weld needs to be just strong enough to keep the metal connected for your final weld later because a tack weld isn t a full or final weld be careful not to drop or put too much pressure on the frame or it could break form the back of the frame by tack welding the 20 in 51 cm tubes the remaining 20 in 51 cm tubes including the tube with the tabs attached to it will form the back of the frame hold the base of the frame upright and connect 2 of the tubes to the corners to form a 90 degree angle then place the tube with your steel tabs at the head of them to form a cross beam take your mig welder and tack weld the inner and outer edges where the tubes meet 7 x research source you may need someone to help you hold the base of the frame upright so you can tack weld the back of the frame to it make a final weld on the corners of the frame with a mig welder a final weld is a much stronger weld than a tack weld and takes a little more time use your mig welder and hold the flame against the corners where you made your tack weld to melt the metal form an even stronger connection work your way all around the connection with the flame so there aren t any gaps and metal is securely attached go over all of the areas you tack welded to make a final weld 8 x research source give the frame a good pull with your hands when you re finished welding to make sure there isn t any movement or instability use a circular saw to cut rods 20 inches 51 cm long from the tubing the 2 strut rods are what will connect to the front of your engine and help support its weight on your stand take your tape measure and marker and measure out 20 in 51 cm long sections on the square tubing then use your circular saw to cut them out 9 x research source the completed stand will support the rear of the engine on the steel tabs attached to the back of the frame while the strut rods will hold the front of the engine drill holes through both tubes 1 inch 2 5 cm from the end use a tape measure to measure 1 inch 2 5 cm from the end of each of the rods and mark the location take a drill with a bit that is able to cut through metal such as titanium or cobalt and bore a hole through the tubes to create slots that will fit bolts to connect the strut rods to your engine 10 x research source place a tab on each side of the holes and bolt them in place take 1 of your strut rods and hold a tab on each side of the hole you drilled through the rod slide a bolt through the tabs and strut rod attach a nut to the other side of the bolt and tighten it so the tabs are securely attached to the rod then repeat the process with your other strut rod 11 x research source make sure the nut is really tight so the tabs don t move the tabs will add extra support to the strut rods when you weld them to the frame place the strut rods on the front of your engine and mark the bolt holes the front of your engine has 2 holes on them that you can use to attach your strut rods securely place your strut rods against the front of your engine so they cover the bolt holes use your marker to mark the location of the bolt holes on each of your strut rods 12 x research source because the distance of the bolt holes can vary from engine to engine placing your strut rods against them is the best way to get an exact measurement make bolt holes in the strut rods with a drill take your strut rods off of the engine and use your drill with a metal cutting bit to bore through the tube drill holes through both strut rods at the location that you marked so they match the bolt holes on your engine precisely 13 x research source make sure the drilled holes are even and consistent bolt the struts to your engine and weld the tabs to the base of the stand place your strut rods on your engine so the bolt holes line up slide a bolt through them to connect them to the engine connect the base of your frame to the tabs on the other end of the strut rods tack weld the tabs to the frame then remove the bolts and strut rods and make a final weld to the tabs to complete your stand 14 x research source lower the engine on to the stand with an engine hoist an engine hoist is a tool that uses hydraulics to raise and lower heavy engines attach the straps of the hoist around the engine and raise it over the stand carefully lower and slide the bolts onto the steel tabs on the back of the stand and the struts on the front once the engine is attached slowly release the tension to make sure the stand is able to support the weight of the engine 15 x research source it s important that you slowly release the tension onto the stand so the hoist can prevent the engine from falling to the ground if the stand can t support it the stand will allow you to access all of the surfaces of the engine so you can make repairs or modifications,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to buy and sell cars for profit,you don t have to be a mechanic to make a little money on used cars in fact most people can buy and flip cars for a few hundred dollars each as they know how to find a good deal which is easier than you might imagine the biggest tip to remember is that you make your money when you buy the car not when you sell it 1 x research source so finding a good deal is your top priority with a little elbow grease and smart negotiating you can almost always flip the car quickly and profitably,search car auctions classifieds ebay and craigslist for cars sold by their owner you will rarely be able to buy a car from a dealer and flip it for a profit as these cars are generally sold at their highest price random people however don t have to pay employees or rent on a lot and can afford to let go of their used car for much less than a dealer can confine your search to these sellers for the best results don t be immediately turned off by salvage titles which are often some of the best deals on the market be sure however to ask what happened to earn the title a broken window is a lot different than a cracked axle but both could cause the car to be considered salvage 2 x research source carfax and other title check sites are good ways to get a cheap vehicle history for bigger buys use online appraisal sites to get a good idea of the base price places like edmunds and kelly blue book let you input the car s make model year and condition and see the general price this is often a good baseline for negotiation and can be used to effectively bargain if someone is grossly overestimating the price these sites usually have ratings too letting you see if the car has common issues to look for or has a record of reliability some tips to make the most of these sites include note the dealer s price you can usually bargain down to the price they expect from a dealership because there will be much less paperwork for both of you check several sites at once and always assume the car will be in worse shape than it is most people will try and sell at the highest price they can find online and will err towards a better condition on their advertisement always start the car from a cold engine be wary of any cars you come across that are already on and running it takes the most energy and momentum to get a cold car started and you can often hear or feel any issues with a bad motor as it lugs to a start be on the lookout for cars that don t start easily or smoothly loud noises or grinding sounds in the engine ticking whining or shaking as the car starts check the oil levels and oil color as you do ask about the car s history starting with its last oil change the lighter the oil the better and it shouldn t ever be dark brown or sludge like especially if it has been changed in the past six months if you see any water or solid bits like metal in the oil walk away repairs won t be cheap have the seller rev the engine 5 6 times and watch the exhaust if produces black or thick smoke you should walk away especially if the oil levels are also low 3 x research source search under the car for leaks once it s been running a while a little water is to be expected but oil or radiator fluid is a big no no and the car likely shouldn t be bought another good way to check this is to have someone rev the engine with the radiator cap off if you see air bubbles in the radiator when the car revs walk off the head gasket is likely blown is the engine temperature high if so and there is hot water leaking from the car not fluid or oil then you might be in for a bargain this could just be a leaky house causing the overheating meaning you can cheaply fix an expensive seeming problem 4 x research source pop the hood to listen and look at the engine there shouldn t be loud ticking noises or gurgling and it s pretty obvious when something doesn t sound quite right have someone rev the engine in neutral and watch to make sure it still sounds good as you watch for any issues turn the car off and check the belts and hoses looking for corrosion rust or heavy wear while 1 2 belts and hoses are easy to fix a complete overhaul could cut away any profits you hoped to make 5 x research source drive the car before buying whenever possible if you re a true bargain hunter with some mechanical skills you might buy a non working car cheaply if you believe you can get it running but in all other cases you want to take the car for a spin test a variety of speeds and variations ideally testing it in both a neighborhood and on a highway or road where you can get the speed up safely as you do pay careful attention to steering is it smooth and responsive braking does it stop the car quickly especially in quick stop situations most importantly does the car stop in a straight line transmission does it shift smoothly on automatic cars you should be able to get into drive and reverse in less than a second and a half any longer delay could be a bad sign electronics and features do the lights windows and ac work is the odometer still running or is it stuck and do they know how long ago it stopped running if so 6 x research source use any and all perceived defects to drive the price down this is especially crucial if they didn t mention these deficits in the ad posting most people are honest and upfront about issues the car might have but you should be constantly searching for other issues to use as a negotiating tool if there are minor to serious issues that they didn t tell you but you re confident can be fixed cheaply you can often get serious discounts as you re examining the car show them issues as you find them most people trust a calm thorough buyer if you walk them through your tests and issues making them more likely to take your word on price gauge their own car knowledge as well if they seem lost around an engine you can use this to your advantage to play up any perceived issues be sure to get the title and copy of the car s registration if they don t have a title on hand you should be very wary about buying the car the title is required to get the car registered and to subsequently get insurance for the vehicle if they can t hand over the title you better be sure the car is worth the hassle of getting it re titled for more expensive cars use a site like carfax to get the title history and avoid any unpleasant surprises 7 x research source determine your lowest possible price and your target price before putting the car on the market use the same appraisal sites you used when buying the car to set a reasonable price using craigslist and local ads to find nearby buyers if you don t care how quickly the car sells start the price on the high end if you want it gone quickly keep it on the lower end and note that you re firm on the price 8 x research source even if you say you re firm on the price people will still be looking to negotiate the phrase obo or best offer is used to indicate that you re willing to negotiate on the price which is a good way to convince people to call you if the car is high value or a rare find you might be able to make more money at an auction than a direct sale know of course that all auctions are a bit of a gamble you might get way more than you hoped but you could also get far less get the car checked out by a mechanic and fix any issues as long as they are cheap enough to still resell at a profit this is why you must set your price point early on if the cost of the repairs makes the care more expensive than you can sell it for the repairs are obviously not worth it however if you can get a cheap car with relatively cheap fixes you ll be able to charge more than it cost for the repairs while buying a car that needs repairs can be a roll of the dice smart buyers can turn big profits on small issues that the original seller was too lazy to fix be sure to check online if the car has any common issues or problems can you do anything to convince potential buyers the problem has been handled what repairs can you do yourself older cars tend to have pages of advice on home repairs online and more of them are in the range of a home mechanic than you might imagine 9 x research source get the car as clean as you possibly can a clean car is much easier to sell especially for a higher price furthermore vacuuming and cleaning the windows costs you nothing despite potentially making the difference between cash in hand and a missed sale be sure to wipe down all surfaces with a clean cloth vacuum all surfaces including under and around the mats rinse and wash off the exterior including hubcaps for higher priced cars consider a coat of wax to give it a clean sheen 10 x research source show any obvious defects to the buyer and include them in your ad if they know the problems beforehand and still show up they can t use them to drive the price down if they find issues you didn t mention however they suddenly have a few bargaining chips being honest upfront may seem like it is admitting to a bad sale but it only brings in buyers who will be serious about the purchase while you may be able to skate some smaller issues past a buyer without them noticing people will generally pay more to a seller they find honest and trustworthy be sure to provide plenty of pictures especially of problem areas you noted like a ripped seat this inspires confidence and can help people stop worrying about potential defects 11 x research source change the oil radiator fluid and wiper fluid if necessary to instantly raise the price unless these were done recently by the seller this is a cheap way to clean the car up and raise the price be sure to note these services in your ad as buyers will be happy to hear that they don t have to worry about these little hassles and are generally willing to pay a bit more be sure to note the registration status as well if it is almost up people will have to pay 100 or more in order to re register it and they may factor that into their bargaining be aware of state specific requirements like california s smog tests if you can get this done ahead of time you can usually charge more than the test s cost as you ll have eliminated the hassle of making them pay for a smog test keep tabs on what other cars sell for even if you re not interested in buying them right now for example imagine you see a clean 1987 bmw e30 sell for 2 500 at an auction while this is far too high to buy and sell for a profit you ll know that a similar car on sale for 1 500 might be a good investment later on and when you sell it you can comfortably keep the price at 2 000 or higher knowing someone will pay that much watch or check out car auctions and car sale shows to get a good idea of prices on a variety of cars check into car appraisal sites regularly and watch the newspapers for car sales even when you re not in the market the more cars and prices you see the sharper your sales mind will become look for buyers and sellers who want to move quickly with little hassle if you re working with other people trying to make a profit you re going to both be fighting for every penny but people who just want a car off of their hands or buyers who want a car to get them around without hassle are going to be much easier to negotiate with when buying cars looks for phrases like getting rid of need to make some quick cash or other indicators that someone wants the car gone no matter what the price when selling cars pay attention to those that move quickly or seem excited before they ve even seen the car be sure to ask why or what they want the car for as this can clue you into their financial situation desperation signals good deals 12 x research source bargain like a shark buying and selling cars isn t for the faint of heart if you want to make any money in this game you re going to have to learn to negotiate while everyone has different strategies the best overarching principle is to be honest with yourself beforehand ask yourself two questions what do you want to pay for the car ideally and what is the maximum you re willing to pay start a little lower than the first number and work your way slowly to the second be honest with the seller i can only buy sell this car for 1 200 can you meet me there if they can t you can walk away always have the cash on hand and ask potential buyers to do the same if you can pay right on the spot you can often get them to lower their price to save everyone the hassle of meeting again don t get emotional about this you re only buying the car for the money if they don t meet your pre planned price get out bring a friend along especially if they are knowledgeable about cars two heads are better than one and if you ve got a friend who is handy with a wrench it pays dividends to bring them around not everyone knows everything about cars but that doesn t mean you can t still make a profit your friend can rev the engine for you watch the car as you take test drives or inspect the motor and point out little defects you may miss in general it is a good idea to have a friend along for online deals to stay safe always meet people in a public place 13 x research source feel free to leave cars and come back later for a better price unless you are totally confident that a car is a bargain leave your phone number and have them call you about the sale remember that these cars are just there to make money so don t get too emotionally attached if they sell to someone else while you re playing hardball if you really want to get good prices waiting 2 3 days will help your gauge the seriousness of the seller as well as the overall condition of the car if it still hasn t sold in a few days you can almost always ask to cut 10 25 off the price 14 x research source trust your instincts when dealing with buyers and sellers if a car doesn t feel right or a deal feels shady there is no shame in walking away hundreds of used cars are on the market at any one time and your goal here is to turn a profit not take undue risks if you re wary that someone is taking advantage of you or neglecting the entire story trust your gut and walk away there will always be more deals on the road 15 x research source look the seller in the eye and ask them if you re making the right choice buying the car they should be able to look right back at you and shake your hand,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

grow to the level of the big players like carnival or royal caribbean you can still create a smaller line that offers personalized service or unique routes,gain industry experience you don t need to have worked in the boating industry to start a cruise line but doing well will require an intimate knowledge of this industry and the inner working of cruise ships you may be able to gain a good amount of experience by being a cruise planner like a travel agent for cruises or a high ranking employee aboard another cruise ship for example working as a captain entertainment coordinator guest

your next sentence to train your brain to remember it and help build rapport with them 3 x research source in practice this would go something like you hi my name is john and i m a salesman here what s your name customer my name is jane you nice to meet you jane what are you looking for today keep using the person s name throughout your conversation and write it down with any notes you take after

pressuring a sale 8 x research source for example you can ask things like what kind of vehicle are you interested in looking at today what kind of vehicle do you currently own and what do you like or dislike about it and why did you choose our dealership to come to today even if the customer is just looking questions like these will help you gauge their interests and give you a lead for a potential sale even if it s in the future treat everyone equally and don t make assumptions about them don t profile customers based on anything like race gender age or how they dress ask everyone the

answering your questions let customers talk about themselves as much as they want and listen to them attentively 10 x research source wait 1 2 seconds after a potential buyer ends a response to a question or states an opinion before you follow up with another question or statement to make sure they are done talking offer to show them cars that meet the customer s requirements try to understand

anything they particularly don t want in a car so you can show them vehicles that they might be interested in 11 x research source for instance the customer might be shopping for a car for their teenager so they may want a car with lots of safety features or they might need a car for their daily commute that will last a long time and isn t expensive to maintain listen for cues in the customer s responses to your questions and in anything else they say so that you can address them later on for example they might say something like i don t have a lot of credit or a high budget i just want something affordable and reliable use this to guide them to budget friendly reliable cars later on in the conversation make sure you know about all the different cars on the lot read up on every new car you get on the lot and memorize its features and specifications buyers are much more likely to buy a car from someone who is knowledgeable and able to answer their questions about any type of car they see on the lot 12 x research source if the customers get the sense that you don t know what you are talking about it is highly likely they will tell you they ll be back and you ll never see them again because they don t trust you to help them make an informed purchase spend 10 30 minutes each morning reviewing the information about any cars you don t have completely memorized so you are ready to talk about them with potential buyers be honest with customers so you don t lose their trust it s inevitable that at some point a customer will ask you a question that you don t know the answer to tell the customer you don t know but you will get the answer for them right away 13 x research source for example maybe a customer will ask you what the gas mileage rating is of a car and you don t know the answer in this case say something like to be honest i don t know but let me just look up that answer for you quickly and i will let you know right away give the customer your card and leave them be if they are not interested there will always be customers who are not interested in talking with a salesperson and will not engage with you in a dialogue hand them a card and politely let them know where to find you if they have any questions 14 x research source you will usually be able to tell these customers apart within the first 30 seconds of talking to them watch for signs like if the customer is avoiding eye contact seems uncomfortable or is only giving you one word responses to your questions these types of customers will appreciate that you were not pushy with them and may come back to you for help when they are ready to purchase a car take interested customers on test drives to try and close the deal offer to take customers on test drives when they are considering a particular car so they can try the car out and feel what it would be like to own it test drives are the best time to ask customers if they are interested in taking the car home that day because they will feel more attached to the car 15 x research source at some point during the drive you can ask the customer to pull over into an empty parking lot or somewhere safe to do so get out of the car together and have the customer look at it again from the outside after driving it then ask them something like so now that you know what it would be like to own this car and drive it every day what do you think about taking it home with you today many customers have already done research on a car and know more or less what they are looking for before they come to your dealership a good experience with you and a test drive can be all it takes to seal the deal wait till a customer is ready to buy a car to discuss the price wait until a customer seems like they are in love with a car ask them if they are ready to buy and only then begin to discuss the price and payment options 16 x research source say something like so is this a car you are ready to buy today then if the client says yes go speak with the sales manager to negotiate the best price for the customer and discuss things like cash down financing and trade in value follow up with customers 7 10 days after a sale make sure you get a phone number to reach customers at after a sale call them up ask them how they are enjoying their new purchase and thank them again for deciding to buy from you 17 x research source this extra level of service will help them keep you in mind next time they are car shopping they are also more likely to recommend you to friends who may be in the market for a new

how to loosen lug nuts,lug nuts are used to secure the wheel to the vehicle and lug nuts need to be loosened and eventually removed any time you want to change a tire access the brakes and do a variety of other repairs on your vehicle learning to loosen and install lug nuts is an essential skill for anyone who drives a car you never know when you might need to fix a flat fortunately it s not that difficult to learn and there are a number of tricks that can help you remove even difficult stuck on lug nuts,park the car on a level surface and set the parking brake remove the hubcap if present and locate the lug nuts depending on your vehicle the hubcap may need to be removed before you re able to access the lug nuts and loosen them hubcaps are usually either attached by metal clips held on by the lug nuts themselves or using plastic lugs 1 x research source if your hubcaps clip on pry them off using the flat end of the tire iron or a flathead screwdriver against a thick or solid part of the hubcap if your hubcaps are held on by the lug nuts you ll only be able to remove them after you ve removed the lug nuts entirely if you try to remove them before doing so you ll break them if your hubcaps screw on using plastic lugs you ll need to remove these with a lug wrench and avoid excessive force when reinstalling them to avoid breakage examine the lug nuts the wheels of cars trucks and other vehicles will be affixed to the axle with between four and eight lug nuts used to center the wheel and secure it onto the vehicle some european cars will have lug bolts instead of nuts though the removal process should be exactly the same on some cars locking lugs are used to keep the wheels from being stolen this is usually only necessary for one lug nut per wheel and it should look different than the others these require a special key to unlock require the use of a key to loosen the lock on the end of the lug nut on some locking lug nuts you can hammer on a ⅞ 12 point socket and remove the locking lug bolt instead of using the special key the hardest part is that you also need a vice to put the socket in to hit the locking lug nut off with a punch use a lug wrench to remove lug nuts a lug wrench sometimes called a tire iron tire tool or a t bar should be provided in your vehicle s tire kit along with a jack and a spare tire lug wrenches should fit the lug nuts used on your wheel assembly perfectly and in most cases you shouldn t need other tools to remove them lug wrenches can be either a straight bar or two crossed bars which is sometimes called a spider wrench the crossed bars give you extra strength because you can grab onto either side with your hands and twist with all your arm strength if your lug nuts are stuck on because of rust over tightening or some other factor read the next section for tips on loosening especially tenacious lug nuts begin loosening the lug nuts while the car is still on the ground don t jack up the car before you attempt to loosen lug nuts instead use the resistance created by the tire s contact with the ground to help you loosen the nuts they won t spin if they re on the ground which means you ll be able to remove them much more easily place the lug wrench on a lug nut and turn it counter clockwise turn the wrench after you ve secured it onto one of the nuts pulling hard until you feel the lug nut begin to loosen you don t need to remove the lug nut entirely just use the wrench to loosen it until it s loose enough to remove with your fingers continue loosening the bolts it doesn t matter which nut you loosen first pick one then continue moving around the bolts in a star pattern skipping the lug nut adjacent to the one you just loosened this pattern helps keep the wheel centered and is more important when you re installing the wheel still it s a good habit to get into when you re loosening the bolts as well when all the bolts are loose it s time to jack the car up remove the lug nuts entirely spinning them off by hand and then remove the wheel to complete whatever project you ve planned if your project requires mores than just immediately replacing the the wheel with the spare or a new wheel you should put a frame stand under the car until the project is complete double check that the parking brake is on if your lug nuts are stuck you ll need to exert extra force to remove them before you do that you want to make sure that your car isn t going anywhere make sure you re on a flat surface and that your parking brake is engaged before attempting to wrangle with tenacious stuck on lug nuts get additional leverage factory lug wrenches usually have short handles that don t provide much leverage the first and safest thing you should do is get the physics of leverage on your side if the handle of the wrench you re using is longer it ll be much easier to loosen the nut increase your leverage by using a breaker bar these are typically longer and stronger than the lug wrenches that come with most cars if the breaker bar alone is insufficient find a length of pipe that you can fit over the handle of the wrench or breaker bar so that you are able to turn from farther away from the nut you should be able to use your hands when choosing a pipe the closer to the size of the handle the better use your foot if you re stuck with nothing else to use and your arms are not strong enough to loosen the lug nut you can use your stronger leg muscles to get the loosening process started be careful though if you must do this attach the lug wrench to the nut securely and arrange the handle at an angle nearly parallel to the ground carefully use one foot to press down on the lug wrench turning it counter clockwise use your leg and push hard brace yourself against the car and stand on the wrench bouncing gently if necessary when it loosens stop and use the wrench as normal be extremely careful if you re going to try to do this it s not a trampoline don t stomp your foot onto the wrench or jump up and down keep your foot in contact with the wrench at all times and let your weight do the work use a mallet or hammer if you don t have access to any pipe to extend the length of the handle it might be time to get primitive using a rubber mallet or a hammer to pound on the handle of the lug wrench can be an effective way of loosening particularly stuck on lug nuts in an emergency if you re stuck on the side of the highway it might be your only option if you re without a hammer at all a rock or another heavy object could also work be extremely careful to avoid glancing blows if you re going to try to hammer at the bar of the lug wrench use short controlled strikes with the mallet and stop after a few to see if you ve loosened it enough to use another method use a penetrating oil if the lug nuts are rusted to the stud use this only as a last resort if you re struggling against more than over tightening it might be helpful to spray a small to moderate amount of penetrating oil such as pb blaster or liquid wrench directly on the stud threads where they disappear inside the lug nut use the thin straw like tube that came with the penetrating oil to apply the penetrant accurately and try to avoid overspray which may get on the brake drum or rotor let the penetrant sit for about ten minutes to work its way across the threads and loosen things up a bit if the lug nut is still stubborn try one more spritz of a light directed spray to the surface of the threaded stud exactly where the threads start to disappear inside the lug nut let this sit for another ten minutes and check the results the solid impact of moderate taps by a mallet on the lug wrench may now have an effect be sure that your brake discs and drums are free from oil before driving the car again oil on these surfaces is a serious safety hazard as it may lead to brake failure increased stopping distances and accidents clean the metal brake surfaces of the rotor or drum with a clean cloth and suitable solvent such as acetone if you have saturated the brake pads with penetrating oil it is best to replace the pads or consult a certified mechanic if you have gotten oil on the brake surfaces test the brakes at low speed and in the absence of traffic to gauge the stopping power test at higher and higher speeds until you are comfortable with the results remember to give other drivers of the vehicle a heads up that the car may not stop as quickly as in the past and have them test the new braking capabilities too use a wheel lock remover to remove locked lugs if you ve lost the key to your locked lugs you may be able to remove them with a special socket head designed to remove locks featuring reverse threads these heads are great for biting into the lock and loosening it without the need for the key to remove it these heads are also great for removing rounded off lug nuts that might be difficult to remove these are available online and at most auto parts stores to use a wheel lock remover snap it onto the end of your socket wrench and lock it into place use the breaker bar to turn the locked lug counter clockwise as normal it should come loose with some effort use a torque wrench when replacing lug nuts if you struggled to get your lug nuts off because of over tightening on the previous tire change take care to tighten them to the proper specifications this time by using a torque wrench 2 x research source check your owner s manual to see what the recommended torque is for your tires then set your torque wrench to the proper specifications on the side of the wrench then lock it into place with the locking collar additionally tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern do it twice to make sure all the lug nets are tight,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to test a fuse with a multimeter,cars and older homes that don t use modern circuit breakers use fuses to prevent damage from electrical surges sometimes these fuses require testing to check that they are still in good working order testing fuses can be done using a multimeter and doing so is both fast and easy to learn,understand fuses fuses are really just wires that are designed not to last but their purpose is to prevent damage to more valuable electrical equipment or prevent fires especially in homes caused by power surges if too much power runs through the fuse it will burn out quite literally and open the circuit preventing the current from flowing through the circuit there are several varieties of fuses but their differences are primarily in appearance here is a description of the two you are most likely to see the cartridge fuse is a cylindrical fuse that has been common in a wide variety of devices for many years from homes to small electronic devices they have metal contact or terminal points on either end and consist primarily of a tube that contains the wire 1 x research source the blade fuse is a common type of automotive fuse that has come into use in the last 20 30 years they vaguely resemble the plug of a power cord with two metal prongs emanating from a plastic housing that contains the wire previously most vehicles also contained small glass cartridge fuses blade fuses plug conveniently into banks and relatively little space is required to house a large number of them together 2 x research source learn how a multimeter works multimeters measure ac and dc voltage electrical resistance and the flow of current for testing a fuse you can either use it to measure the continuity which tests if the circuit is complete or the ohms which tests resistance 3 x research source a multimeter has a positive and negative lead when testing resistance in a circuit the meter will transmit a small quantity of electricity from its own battery and then measure the amount that passes through the circuit or object understand why you must test fuses testing fuses is the simplest way to examine what is going on in the electrical systems of your car or home and for that reason it is a vital skill to possess it is easier to test fuses than it is to test other electrical equipment other components in your car or home involve complex wiring systems that run on for some length in addition most car parts can only be tested at repair shops and to do so will usually cost quite a lot of money testing fuses with a multimeter is comparatively simple to do and the equipment involved is cheap and easy to operate many types of fuses allow for visual confirmation that the fuse is still functional they are made clear so that you can see if the wire remains intact if the translucent area is blackened it is usually because the fuse has burned out however some fuses will create that blackened stain after only slightly overheating and that may have even been the result of an unnoticed incident weeks or months earlier if a device is not working you should test the fuses if the fuses are all still working there is likely a more serious problem and it may be time to call on an expert turn the equipment off and remove the fuse make sure the device equipment or vehicle is turned off before the fuse is removed to remove the fuse simply pull it straight out of the slot turn the meter on and set it to measure continuity turn the dial on the multimeter so it points to the continuity setting which looks like 5 curved vertical lines before you test the fuse put the positive and negative leads together and listen for the meter to beep to ensure it s working properly if you want to measure the ohms use the multimeter setting that has the omega symbol ω put one lead on each end of the fuse and look at the display because the fuse is little more than a single wire and no complex parts to worry about it does not matter which side receives the positive or negative lead test the fuse listen for the multimeter to beep continuously as you hold the probes against the fuse if you don t hear any noise coming from the meter then the fuse is blown and should be replaced if you re using a digital multimeter set to measure resistance touch the probes together to get an initial reading then put the probes on either side of the fuse and check if the reading is similar if it is then the fuse works properly if you get no reading or ol then the fuse has blown if the multimeter reads open or not complete it means the fuse is broken,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to hook up jumper cables,your battery can be too weak to start your car for a number of reasons including a loss of charge from cold weather age or leaving the lights on overnight whatever the cause you can use jumper cables to connect the dead battery to a live one make sure both batteries are the same size then carefully begin clamping the cables in place the dead battery may then receive enough of a charge to get the car started again,park the vehicles so the batteries are near each other drive the vehicle with the live battery which is the donor car towards the vehicle with the dead battery the battery is typically located underneath the car s hood so you can either park the cars next to each other or facing one another don t let the cars touch though 1 x research source engage the parking brake on both cars the parking brake ensures that the cars stay in place as you jump the battery use the gear stick if your car has one shift the car to p or park to engage the brake setting the car to n or neutral will also prevent it from rolling if your car has manual transmission set it to neutral then engage the emergency brake 2 x research source the emergency brake may be located near the gear stick or gas pedal turn the cars off and remove the keys make sure the donor car is completely off you should hear the engine shut down and can test the radio to see that it doesn t have any power running to it also take the key out of car with the dead battery so it can t start up when the jumper cables are attached 3 x research source doing this protects both engines from power surges and reduces the risk of electrical shock check the batteries to make sure they are the same voltage the voltage will be printed in a visible location usually on a white or yellow sticker on top of the battery it will say something like 12v the live battery needs to match the dead battery or else it can send a dangerous current that burns out the car s systems 4 x research source batteries with similar voltages will be the same size still look for the voltage on the label to avoid possible damage if you aren t sure about using a battery avoid the risk if possible try to find a different donor battery or use a rechargeable battery pack locate the positive and negative battery terminals in each car the cables leading to the positive terminal are almost always red the negative terminal s cables are black if you re not sure the battery will have a and sign on it to mark the positive and negative terminals respectively the red cables lead to the terminal and the black cables go to the terminal 5 x research source check the terminals for corrosion first it looks like white green and blue powder clean the terminals by wiping them with a rag or wire brush separate the jumper cable clamps by laying them on the ground position the cables flat on the ground stretching them out between the 2 cars move the clamps so they aren t touching each other any accidental contact can cause your car s electrical system to short circuit 6 x research source leads on jumper cables are often made in different lengths to prevent them from touching if they are the same length make sure they have not been modified or damaged in any way clamp a red clamp to the positive terminal of the dead battery leave the rest of the jumper cable on the ground as you bring the clamp over to the car double check the and labels on the battery before attaching the clamp squeeze the clamp to open it then fit it securely around the metal terminal 7 x research source on some vehicles you may have to remove a plastic cover from the positive battery terminal before you can make this connection you remove it by twisting it counterclockwise by hand connect each clamp 1 at a time go slowly in order to avoid mistakes that can damage the vehicles secure the other red clamp to the positive terminal on the donor battery carry the clamp to the other car so you can fit in on the correct terminal make sure it is secure so it won t slip off when the engine is activated later 8 x research source remember to match red to red and positive terminal to positive terminal when applying the red clamps connect a black clamp to the negative terminal on the donor battery retrieve the black clamp and bring it back to the live battery the black clamp fits directly on the terminal on the battery as long as it doesn t touch the terminal or red clamp you will be fine if you attach a clamp incorrectly stop before you start the cars remove the clamps carefully working 1 at a time to avoid touching them together clamp the other black lead to an unpainted metal surface in the car the black clamp does not connect to a battery terminal instead find a spot such as a clean bolt in the engine block you may also place the clamp on an unpainted part of the car s body underneath the hood 9 x research source avoid connecting this clamp to the dead battery unless you have no other choice this produces a spark that can ignite hydrogen fumes after the car is turned on don t dig too far down to find a metal surface the fuel lines are down there and you are better off keeping the clamp away from them make sure the jumper cable doesn t hang down into the engine compartment since it can get caught by the moving parts there start the donor vehicle and let it idle for a few minutes use the ignition key to start the engine the electrical systems such as the lights and radio will start while electricity flows to the dead battery give the battery at least 30 seconds to build power before you attempt to start the other car 10 x research source depending on the dead battery s age and condition it may require more time to charge step on the gas pedal to run the rpm up to about 3 000 if you want to drive more power towards the dead battery turn on the dead car s engine turn the key in the ignition to activate the car right away the electrical systems should activate if the lights radio or other electrical components don t come on you may need to give the battery more time shut off the car make sure the cables are attached properly and then try revving the working car to increase the power supply 11 x research source if the car doesn t start after repeated attempts your car may have a different problem it could have a blown fuse if the car s lights come on but the engine won t start the battery is fine you may hear the engine make a clicking noise as you try to start it this could be because of a faulty starter disconnect the jumper cables in reverse starting with the black clamps remove the cables in the exact opposite order from earlier start with the negative grounding cable you attached to a metal component remove the black clamp followed by the red clamp on the donor battery finish by removing the red clamp on the newly charged battery 12 x research source leave the car running so it has time to continue charging or else you will need to jump it again be careful when handling the cables make sure the clamps do not touch until all of them are removed from the batteries,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to calibrate a torque wrench,mechanics rely on torque wrenches to provide accurate and reliable torque readings so they can apply the right amount of force on the nuts and bolts in a vehicle however torque wrenches need to be calibrated regularly to make sure they re giving accurate readings while it may be best to take your torque wrench to a professional for calibrations you can do a pretty good job of keeping your torque wrench accurate by calibrating it at home,measure from the square drive to the handle the square drive is the end of the torque wrench you d attach a socket to for the sake of simplicity use whole inches rather than using any fractions mark the point you measured to on the handle and record the distance on a piece of paper for you to come back to later 1 x research source set the paper aside in a safe space until you need it because 24 inches 61 cm is a common length for most torque wrenches it will serve as the measurement for further steps secure the square drive in the vice orient your bench vice so you can place the square drive of the torque wrench into and have the handle extend out away from the table or bench then insert the square drive into the vice and tighten it until it s secure 2 x research source be careful not to overtighten the vice and damage the square drive on the torque wrench make sure only the square drive itself is caught in the clamp so the wrench can move under the weight you apply calculate the appropriate setting for your weight in order to determine the right setting for the torque wrench multiply the distance you measured in step 2 by the 20 pounds 9 1 kg you will be using for your weight that comes out to 480 inch 1 000 cm pounds 24 inches 61 cm times 20 pounds 9 1 kg which equates to 40 foot 12 2 m pounds 3 x research source be sure to use the correct distance and weight figures if your wrench is a different size or you re using different weights your figures will be different the equation will still be handle distance times weight then divided by 12 hang the weights from the handle of the wrench tie the rope to the weight and make a loop that you can hang from the handle of the torque wrench where you made your mark in step 1 make sure the length of rope is short enough that the weight won t touch the ground once you hang it 4 x research source do not securely tie the weight to the wrench instead simply hang it be sure nothing is in the way of or supporting the weight as it hangs adjust the torque wrench using the weight you can usually adjust the spring tension in a torque wrench by turning a screw located midway up the wrench s handle with a screwdriver hang the 20 pounds 9 1 kg weight from the torque wrench at your first mark and see if it clicks if it doesn t tighten the spring by turning the screw clockwise then lift the weight and lower it again to test it 5 x research source repeat this process until the torque wrench clicks using the known weight be sure to lift the weight off the wrench and lower it again to test for clicking each time move the weights up the handle if you hear a click listen for a click from the torque wrench as you hang the weight from the marked point on the handle if you hear one lift the weight off the handle and set it down again further up the neck moving toward the head of the wrench 6 x research source keep repeating this process until you stop hearing the click be sure to lift the weight off and set it down again each time do not slide it up the handle lower the weights if you don t hear a click if you don t hear a click from the torque wrench as you place the weight on it move the weight down the handle of the wrench until you do hear one 7 x research source start by moving the weight an inch or so at a time it s okay to move up and down the handle of the wrench more than once as you look for the point in which it starts to click mark the point of transition once you find the point in which the handle transitions from clicking to not mark it on the wrench with your pen be sure to mark the point exactly so you may need to make multiple attempts at identifying where it is by moving the weight up and down the handle the part of the handle where it begins or stops clicking is called the transition point measure from the square drive to the point of transition use the measuring tape to find the distance from the square drive to the transition point you identified using the weight record that number on a piece of paper and set it aside a measurement of 26 inches 66 cm will be used for this example but yours may be different 8 x research source be careful not to confuse this number with the figure you recorded in step 2 you may want to test finding the transition point more than once to be sure you have the correct number calculate the applied torque if the transition point of the torque wrench with 20 pounds 9 1 kg was at 26 inches 66 cm for instance multiple that by 20 pounds 9 1 kg to determine the amount of torque actually applied so 26 inches 66 cm times 20 pounds 9 1 kg equals 520 inch 1 000 cm pounds or 50 foot 15 2 m pounds 520 divided by 12 inches 30 cm 9 x research source the equation is the same as before measurement length times weight divided by 12 correct for the difference you identify if you are unable to adjust the torque wrench you can still use it pretty accurately if you adjust the settings you use on the wrench to compensate for the difference divide your first measurement by the transition point in this case 24 divided by 26 which equals 923 whenever you need to use the torque wrench multiply the correct torque by this number 10 x research source multiplying your intended torque by the difference will give you the correct setting for your specific torque wrench this solution can keep you working but the wrench will still need to be calibrated return the scale to zero after each use while all torque wrenches will need to be calibrated regularly you can prolong the life of each calibration by returning the setting of the torque wrench to zero after each time you use it 11 x research source the strain on the internal spring can cause the calibration to drift if not left on zero keep a tight grip on the torque wrench dropping your torque wrench onto any sort of hard surface can instantly affect the tool s calibration be sure to set the torque wrench down in safe places to avoid letting it fall and never use a torque wrench in place of a hammer or lever 12 x research source banging a torque wrench around will immediately affect its calibration torque wrenches have even been known to break when dropped use the torque wrench only for appropriate tasks because a torque wrench looks similar to a breaker bar people often make the mistake of using them interchangeably a torque wrench should only be used in instances that require specific torque specifications using it for other jobs can affect its ability to maintain its calibration 13 x research source using a torque wrench in place of a breaker bar or different type of wrench can affect calibration or even damage the wrench treat the torque wrench as as speciality tool rather than an all purpose one stay within the torque wrench s upper and lower limits exceeding the prescribed limits of a torque wrench can damage it or might affect the wrench s calibration many torque wrenches have clearly indicated upper and lower torque tolerances never use the wrench for jobs that require more or less torque than your wrench is rated for 14 x research source exceeding the maximum torque rating for a wrench may even break it if you damage your torque wrench it may not be able to hold a calibration any longer store your torque wrench in its case and by itself because torque wrenches can be so easily affected by impacts and even temperature changes it s best that you store your torque wrench inside its protective case and separate from other commonly used tools 15 x research source store the torque wrench low so if it does fall it won t be far enough to cause any significant damage to the calibration keep the torque wrench in a climate controlled area big shifts in temperature or humidity can affect its calibration,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to add oil to a hydraulic jack,a hydraulic jack is a device used to lift heavy objects usually cars or trucks the system works by using oil to grease the internal mechanism if you ve just bought a new jack it won t have any oil in it and you ll have to fill it jacks also require oil refills every few years first remove the cover plate and filler plug then fill the chamber with hydraulic jack oil finally follow the procedure to bleed excess air in the system and your jack should be in good working order,position the jack on flat level ground this prevents the jack from rolling while you work on it it also keeps the oil level so you can fill the chamber accurately also place the jack somewhere that can get dirty just in case you spill some oil if you don t want oil in your driveway try doing this in the street open the release valve this lowers the jack so you can access the filler plug different jacks may have different release mechanisms on some jacks turning the handle counterclockwise lowers the press on others you have to press a release valve in a different spot 1 x research source if you re unsure how your jack releases consult your owner s manual keep the release valve open while you work remove the cover plate if your jack has one depending on your jack model there may be a cover plate that protects the jack s internal mechanism remove any screws holding this cover in place then lift the cover off depending on the type of jack you have the cover plate might come off entirely or just lift up if the plate comes off keep it in a safe place so you don t lose it usually these screws require a phillips head screwdriver but check your particular model to see what type of screwdriver you need don t lose the screws you remove keep them in a safe place so you can put the cover back on later wipe the area around the filler port plug the filler port is where you will pour the oil to prevent contamination use a rag and clean off the area around the filler plug this keeps dirt out of the oil reservoir 2 x research source if your jack is old and there is a lot of caked on dirt around the fill plug try spraying a hose or pressure washer to remove the gunk first remove the filler port plug this plug is underneath the cover plate on most jacks depending on your jack model the plug might unscrew or just pop out if it is a screw type use a screwdriver and turn counterclockwise to remove the plug if it pops out insert a flathead screwdriver under the plug and lift it out 3 x research source if you can t locate the filler port check the owner s manual for your jack be careful not to damage the plug when you remove it if it doesn t come out easily stop and reassess what you re doing don t force it out fill the reservoir with hydraulic jack oil pour until the oil is just below the lower rim of the fill hole then stop wipe away any excess oil on the rim before replacing the plug use a funnel to avoid spills do not use any other type of oil besides hydraulic jack oil motor oil or brake fluid will not work replace the filler plug either push the plug back into the hole or screw it back in by turning it clockwise after the plug is in place follow the procedure to bleed air out of the hydraulic system 4 x research source do not replace the cover plate yet you still need to bleed the air from the mechanism before moving on and the cover plate will get in the way depending on the jack model you may also have to keep the fill plug out while you bleed the air consult your owner s manual for the correct process confirm that the release valve is open the release valve should still be open from when you filled the jack with oil but double check open the release mechanism completely to lower the jack leave the release valve open while bleeding the air 5 x research source the bleeding process is important because air can build up in the hydraulic system while you change the oil if air is in the system the jack won t rise properly and could even collapse bleeding the jack removes the air and makes the jack function correctly pump the handle quickly 10 15 times with the release valve open this pushes air out of the jack system with the release valve open the jack shouldn t rise while you pump if it starts rising double check to make sure the release valve is open 6 x research source some jack models have different variations on how to bleed the air check with your owner s manual to see if your model uses a different method close the release valve and test the jack turn the handle clockwise to close the release valve then pump the jack it should rise in smooth even motions pump it all the way to the top and then release it 7 x research source if the jack is jerky or doesn t rise to the top there is probably still air in the system repeat the bleeding procedure in this case replace the cover plate with the process done you can now reinstall all the pieces you removed put the cover plate back in place and screw it in with the screws you removed before 8 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to use jack stands,while you can replace a tire just using a car jack you should use jack stands when doing any work underneath your vehicle jack stands provide a sturdier base and support the weight of your vehicle easily when using jack stands make sure to place them at your vehicle s pinch points or on its frame to keep them from slipping once you re finished with your work lift your vehicle up and slide the stands out from underneath and you re set to drive,find a flat level surface to park your vehicle work on a clean paved area so your vehicle is on even ground avoid jacking your vehicle in a place that s bumpy near heavy traffic or covered in gravel make sure each side of your vehicle is level so the jack or jack stands can t slip out from underneath it working in a garage or a flat driveway is the best place to lift your vehicle activate your vehicle s parking brake find the lever in your vehicle that controls your parking brake and pull it until it s activated the parking brake will ensure your vehicle doesn t lurch forwards or backwards while you jack it place chocks or tire wedges around each of your wheels if you re lifting up the back end of your car if you don t have tire wedges you can use 2 in 4 in 5 1 cm 10 2 cm boards in front of and behind your wheels locate an area underneath your vehicle to place your floor jack use hydraulic floor jack for the safest way to lift your vehicle slide the floor jack underneath your vehicle so the arm is underneath the frame of your vehicle or at a lift point 1 x research source don t use a scissor jack since they are less stable and only meant for emergency situations like changing a tire consult with your vehicle s manual to determine the best place to jack it raise your vehicle so the tires are 2 3 in 5 1 7 6 cm off the ground crank the handle up and down to lift your vehicle off of the ground continue lifting your vehicle until the tire or tires closest to your jack are completely off the ground 4 x research source don t lift your car higher than you need or else it could be unstable on the jack set the jack stand underneath the pinch points of your vehicle the pinch points are located on the sides of your vehicle behind your front tires or in front of your rear tires slide your jack stand in from the side of your vehicle line up the divot on your jack stand with the part of the pinch point that extends down 5 x research source if your vehicle doesn t have pinch points set the jack stands underneath the vehicle s frame don t crawl underneath your vehicle while it s jacked until you have stands secured in place adjust the height of the jack stand if you need to if you have an adjustable jack stand lift the top of the jack stand up until it s touching the pinch point on your vehicle once you ve changed the height of the stand put the safety pin attached to the stand through the hole at the base to secure it place that way it won t fall down when the weight of your vehicle is placed on it 6 x research source always place the safety pin in your jack stand or else the vehicle could fall on top of you while you re underneath it some jack stands cannot be adjusted if yours doesn t change height you can skip this step lower your vehicle slowly onto the jack stand slowly turn the lever on your floor jack counterclockwise to drop your vehicle back down the jack stand will support the weight on the side of your vehicle so you can safely work underneath it pull the jack out from underneath your vehicle 7 x research source if you have room underneath your vehicle keep the jack in place for additional security push your vehicle slightly to make sure it s sturdy give your vehicle a small nudge to see if it moves around or shifts its weight the jack stand and your vehicle shouldn t move when you push it if it does avoid going underneath the vehicle and try to place the jack stand in a new area 8 x research source place additional jack stands to lift your vehicle completely off the ground continue jacking up your vehicle on each side and sliding jack stands underneath the pinch points make sure the stands on opposite sides are straight across from one another so your vehicle is sturdy once you ve placed the jack stands you need you can start working underneath your vehicle make sure any adjustable jack stands are the same height so your vehicle doesn t sit crooked raise your vehicle 1 in 2 5 cm above your jack stand when you re finished working roll your floor jack back underneath your vehicle so it s in line with the lift point you used crank the lever up and down to lift the vehicle up so you can pull out the jack stand easily 9 x research source pull the jack stand out from the side of your vehicle reach underneath your vehicle from the side and slide your jack stand out don t crawl underneath the front or back of your vehicle while removing jack stands since it s only being supported by the jack 10 x research source don t adjust the height of your jack stand until it s out from under your vehicle lower the jack until your vehicle is back on the ground turn the lever on your floor jack counterclockwise to slowly lower your vehicle once your tires are back on the ground roll your jack out from under your vehicle 11 x research source hold the lever on your floor jack low to the ground so the bottom of your vehicle doesn t bump into it continue to lift your vehicle and remove the stands until you ve got them all place your jack underneath the lift points and raise your vehicle on each side if you need to remove additional jack stands if you jacked your vehicle completely off the ground remove both of the jack stands from the front before removing the ones in back,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to remove lug nuts and tires,whether you need to take off your car tire to change a flat rotate it or do some repairs you ll need to remove the lug nuts first it s important you remove the lug nuts and your tire safely so you don t get hurt by taking a few precautions and working slowly you can safely and successfully get your tire off your vehicle,use the appropriate tool to loosen the lug nuts before jacking the car up use your wrench or tire iron to break the lug nuts loose do not remove them completely but turn them a quarter turn or so in the counter clockwise direction each to make them loose enough to unscrew while the vehicle is in the air 1 x research source you can purchase tire irons from your local auto parts stores that usually have an end that fits all vehicles you may also choose to simply use a deep socket of the appropriate size with a ratchet or breaker bar remove the lug nuts because the lug nuts are already loose from before you lifted the car they should be fairly easy to unscrew the rest of the way use a wrench if need be to turn the lug nuts counter clockwise until they come off of the lug studs 2 x research source the wheel may shift as you remove the lug nuts so watch your fingers for pinches remove the lug nuts across from one another in a star pattern rather than each one in a row apply liquid thread loosen it if need be if the lug nuts have rusted over apply a generous amount of a thread loosener or rust remover to the nuts allow it to sit for a few minutes then attempt to loosen the lug nut again 3 x research source if the lug nut and stud break you will need to have a new lug stud installed in order to repair the vehicle be sure to use the correct sized socket a socket that is slightly too large could round off the lug nut a stripped or rounded lug nut will have to be cut off by a professional set the lug nuts aside someplace safe place the lug nuts in a safe place to be sure you don t lose them if you lose a lug nut you may be able to secure the wheel temporarily with the remaining nuts but if you lose more than one it will not be safe to drive the vehicle until they have been replaced 4 x research source you can purchase replacement lug nuts at your local auto parts store store the lug nuts in a small bowl or container so they can t roll away as you work pull the wheel toward you once the lug nuts have been removed place your hands on either side of the tire grip the back of the tire and pull it toward you to remove the wheel from the lug studs if the wheel has not been removed in a long time it may require quite a bit of force to pull the wheel off 5 x research source be careful if the tire is damaged there may be metal wire sticking out of it that can cut you wear gloves to pull on a damaged tire use a rubber mallet to loosen stuck on wheels if the wheel is seized in place and won t come off from you pulling on it use a rubber mallet to bang it loose strike the tire where the rim and tire meet all along the circumference of the wheel until it breaks loose 6 x research source do not use a metal hammer to hit the rims or you may damage them it may take a good deal of force to remove the stuck wheel if it is rusted in place locate the designated jack points for the vehicle each vehicle has specific points on the frame that are designed to withstand the weight of jacking up the vehicle these jack points are not always easily identified so refer to your vehicle s owner s manual to help you find them if you are having difficulty 7 x research source there are usually jack points on the frame of your car to the inside of each wheel and at a center point on the front and back of the car jacking the car up at a point that is not designed for it can cause damage to the frame of the vehicle close the valve on the jack trolley jacks utilize hydraulics to lift your vehicle off of the ground when the hydraulic valve is open the jack can t create pressure on the piston to lift the car use the handle of the jack to turn the valve clockwise until it is completely closed re insert the handle into the jack once done if you used the handle to close the valve different jacks may place the valve in different places but it is often a different color than the rest of the jack or is left unpainted completely if you are using a scissor jack there is no valve you need to close place the jack beneath the appropriate jack point slide your jack beneath the jack point closest to the wheel you intend to remove so the cup of the jack is sitting just beneath the frame you may need to raise the cup of the jack slightly by lifting the jack handle and pressing it back down or spinning it once to make sure the jack is positioned properly the cup on the jack should be centered on the designated jack point for the vehicle there are teeth or ridges on the cup of the jack to help prevent the car s frame from sliding as it s jacked up use the jack to lift the vehicle depending on the type of jack you are using you will need to either raise and lower the handle on a trolley jack or turn it on a scissor jack to raise the vehicle start slow paying close attention to the frame around the jack point to look for signs of bending or crimping of the metal if you see signs that the metal is bending lower the car and reposition the jack unto the jack point properly only jack the car up as high as necessary raising a vehicle up too high can increase the danger of it falling off of the jack or jack stands once it is high enough to change the tire place jack stands beneath it for safety do not place any part of your body under the vehicle unless you have jack stands in place to support it you only need to lift the vehicle up until the tire is no longer touching the ground to remove it find a firm even area to jack up the car as you jack up a portion of the car to remove the wheel the weight of that portion will be centered on the relatively small space beneath the jack as a result it is essential that you jack your car up in an area that can support the pressure concrete and blacktop are the best options for jacking up the car it is extremely unsafe to jack a vehicle up on an angle so it is also very important that you choose a level surface 8 x research source never jack up a vehicle on slanted or uneven surfaces jacking a car up on a surface that isn t strong enough can cause the jack to topple over or sink ensure you have space to work safely whether you re using an emergency jack or a trolley jack it s important to ensure you have enough room to work without putting yourself or others at risk make sure you have at least enough room to stand with an outstretched arm toward the jack without coming into contact with a wall or being in the street if you are replacing a flat tire 9 x research source make sure there s enough room to sit behind your jack without being in the lane of the road make sure the car is in park if your car is equipped with an automatic transmission it should be in park before you jack it up putting your car in park prevents the wheels from turning and will keep the vehicle from rolling off of the jack remember however your car may still shift when in park so it s important to utilize wheel chocks in conjunction with placing the vehicle in park 10 x research source remember that putting the car in park will lock its drive wheels in place so a front wheel drive car s front wheels won t turn in park and vice versa for a rear wheel drive vehicle if your car is equipped with a manual transmission try putting the car in first gear to prevent it from rolling you can place rocks or plastic wheel chocks purchased from an auto parts store behind the wheels to ensure they can t turn while you lift the vehicle engage the parking brake depending on the make and model of the vehicle the parking brake may be a handle in the center console or a pedal on your left side when sitting in the driver s seat pull up on the handle or press down on the pedal to engage the parking brake and prevent your vehicle from rolling while it s being jacked up 11 x research source your owner s manual can help you locate your parking brake if you are unsure the parking brake locks the rear wheels in place so it will not help if the entire back end of the car is in the air,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to check fuses,a blown fuse can be annoying but it actually helps prevent electrical damage and fire fortunately fuses are inexpensive and easy to replace if the power s out in your home or car you should be able to check the fuses simply by looking at them look inside the fuse in question for black charred marks or a broken filament wire if you can t see any obvious signs you can always use a test light or multimeter to figure out if the fuse is working properly,look for the fuse box in your basement or garage check for a metal box with a door inside you ll see lots of glass fuses that screw into sockets typically fuse boxes are located in basements garages laundry rooms and attics 1 x research source if you have trouble finding your fuse box check the utility meter outside your home try to follow the wire that leads from the meter fuse boxes and circuit breakers are usually located near where power enters the house older homes have glass fuses that look like light bulbs when fuses blow they need to be replaced newer homes on the other hand have circuit breakers instead which just need to be flipped and reset turn off the power and unplug the appliances on the blown circuit look for a large switch at the top of the panel and toggle it from on to off in addition to shutting off the main power unplug the appliances that turned off when the fuse blew that way they won t overload the replacement fuse when you turn on main power 2 x research source if there s no main power switch you should see a large block at the top of the panel pull it out and check for on and off labels if it s labeled reinsert it with the off side facing up if there s no label set the block aside while you replace the blown fuse check the fuses for charred glass or broken filaments see if there s a diagram or labels on the inside of the panel door if you re lucky you ll be able to look up the room where the power went out and track down the corresponding fuse twist that fuse counterclockwise pull it out from the socket and look inside the glass for black marks or a broken filament wire 3 x research source if your fuse box is unlabeled check each fuse individually for charred marks or broken filaments once you ve found the one that blew label it if you label your fuses every time you replace one you ll eventually have a full diagram of the box swap the blown fuse out for one with the same power rating look for a number on the fuse which indicates its amp rating write down the number or take the blown fuse with you to the hardware store to ensure you get an identical match then plug the replacement fuse in and turn it clockwise to lock it in place 4 x research source fuse ratings vary by country but common amperages include 15 20 and 30 turn the power back on to test the new fuse once you ve plugged in the fuse double check to make sure you disconnected all of your electrical devices from the broken circuit when you re ready flip the main fuse switch or reinsert the main block to restore power to your home then test the circuit by checking the lights or plugging in your electronic devices 5 x research source if your electronics still don t work after replacing the fuse shut down main power and make sure the fuse is tightly connected if the fuse blows again soon after you replaced it you may be using more electrical devices than the circuit can handle try using fewer devices or unplug non essential appliances when they re not in use 6 x research source if you still can t find the problem call an experienced electrician it could mean that your home s wiring is faulty look under the hood or dashboard for your vehicle s fuse box many cars have 2 or more fuse boxes but there s no universal standard for their placement most manufacturers place them near the car s engine or battery beneath the steering wheel or inside the glove box look for a gray or black box it may be labeled as fuses 7 x research source check your car s manual if you have trouble finding the fuse boxes if you don t have your manual search online for fuse box placement plus your car s year make and model find the fuse that controls the device that s stopped working lift the latch on the side of the fuse box to loosen the cover check the inside of the lid for a diagram of the devices each fuse controls your manual may also include a diagram but if all else fails you can also find information on your specific vehicle online 8 x research source the diagram will also list the fuse s amperage which you ll need to know to purchase a replacement be sure to turn your car off before troubleshooting the fuse box remove the blown fuse from the box using fuse pullers or tweezers some cars and fuse replacement kits include small plastic fuse pullers which you can use to pluck the fuse from the box if you don t have fuse pullers handy a pair of tweezers will do the trick in a pinch you can also carefully pull the fuse from the box with your fingers 9 x research source make sure your car is completely off before you pull out the blown fuse keep the keys out of the ignition to avoid accidentally putting it in run or accessories mode otherwise you could get a nasty shock check the fuse for a broken filament or discoloration car fuses are small so it s a little tougher to find signs that one blew hold it up to the light and look closely inside for a thin wire that connects the 2 sides of the fuse if the wire is broken or if you see charred marks the fuse has blown 10 x research source if the wire is intact and the fuse seems fine double check your diagram to ensure you have the correct fuse if you ve checked each fuse individually and none have blown your car s electrical system may need a mechanic s attention if you re not able to visually tell if the fuse has blown then you may need to check the fuses with a multimeter to determine if it s working install a new fuse with an amperage that matches the one that blew head to an auto shop or major retailer s automotive department to find fuses for your car bring the blown fuse with you to ensure you get the right match once you ve purchased the right replacement simply insert it into the slot where you removed the blown fuse 11 x research source make sure the car is off before you set the fuse into the empty slot press down with a little pressure until it pops into place car fuses are color coded so if the fuses are a different color you know right away they aren t a match additionally be sure the prong shape of the new fuse matches the old one if necessary ask an employee at the store for help finding the right replacement check automotive fuses with a simple test light put your key in the ignition and turn it to accessories mode open the fuse box then insert the tester s probe into the tiny port on the face of a fuse if the tester lights up the fuse is working properly 13 x research source using a test light is a great way to find a blown fuse when you can t identify visual signs such as a broken filament or black marks you can find car fuse test lights online at auto shops and in the automotive department at most major retailers the tester has 1 or 2 prongs that fit into the tiny test ports on the outside face of all automotive fuses test a plug fuse with a multimeter if you don t see signs that it blew set your multimeter to test resistance the setting looks like the greek letter omega or ω turn off the fuse box s main power switch then remove the fuse you d like to test set the fuse glass side down on a non conductive surface such as a wood workbench or laminate counter so the metal plug end faces up 14 x research source plug fuses which are often found in home fuse boxes have threaded terminals that look like the ends of standard light bulbs to test it touch one of the multimeter s probes to the very tip of the fuse s terminal touch the other probe to the side of the terminal near where the threading stops if the multimeter displays a resistance between 0 and 5 ω ohms the fuse is good a higher resistance means a degraded or potentially blown fuse and a reading of ol over limit means the fuse is definitely blown 15 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source like an automotive test light using a multimeter to test a home plug fuse is a good solution if you suspect a blown fuse but can t find any clear visual signs use a multimeter to test cylindrical fuses in electronic devices if your electronic instrument or appliance is on the fritz remove the fuse according to the manufacturer s instructions typically electronic devices use tube shaped fuses with a glass body and terminals at each end set your multimeter to test resistance and place the fuse on a non conductive surface 16 x trustworthy source pubmed central journal archive from the u s national institutes of health go to source touch one of the multimeter s probes to each of the fuse s terminals as with plug fuses a resistance reading of 0 to 5 ω means the fuse works a higher reading or a reading of ol means the fuse is bad you can inspect cylindrical fuses for broken filaments or charred marks just like automotive and plug fuses however if you can t see clearly inside the fuse testing it with a multimeter can help you figure out whether or not it works,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to clean battery terminals,whether you re dealing with the battery in your car or an ordinary household battery including 9v batteries tend to build up dirt and sometimes to corrode battery grime can cause acid to leak from your battery and can also decrease the overall life of your battery clean the battery by washing and scraping off dirt and corrosion from the connection points keeping your battery connections clean can not only help your battery live longer but can also save you money,lift the hood of your car and assess the condition of the battery you do not need to remove the battery from the vehicle to assess it or to clean it to simply access the battery pop open the car hood and locate the battery it s typically on the front left side of the engine block visually inspect the general condition of your car battery if the battery is not cracked or leaking battery acid you can go ahead and start cleaning 1 x research source if your battery case has cracks you should replace the entire battery visit a local auto parts store and purchase a battery there assess the degree of corrosion on the battery and cables lift up and to the sides the plastic covers on top of the battery this will reveal the terminal clamp interface examine the battery cables and clamps for excess wear or corrosion corrosion appears as a white ashy deposit around one or both battery posts if the cables and clamps are lightly corroded or have just a little buildup follow the instructions below on how to clean them 2 x research source if the damage is extensive you may want to completely replace the cables and clamps to avoid future problems disconnect the negative and positive clamps on your car battery before cleaning the battery you ll need to disconnect the battery to do this loosen the nuts on the clamps using a wrench once loosened remove the negative clamp marked with a first only after the negative clamp is removed remove the positive clamp marked with a 3 x research source the clamps may prove difficult to remove especially if there is a lot of corrosion you may need to use pliers to remove them if you do need to use pliers be careful not to touch the tool to the car frame or anything else metal and the battery while working doing so will short out the battery make a cleaning agent out of baking soda and water combine 2 3 tablespoons 30 44 ml of baking soda with 1 tablespoon 15 ml of distilled water in a small bowl stir the ingredients together with a spoon to make a thick paste keep stirring until all of the bits of baking soda are fully dissolved in the water 4 x research source baking soda is alkaline which means that it s capable of neutralizing corrosion from battery acid apply the baking soda paste to the battery connections dip an old toothbrush or a lightly dampened rag into the baking soda paste rub the paste onto the corroded or dirty parts of your car s battery once the baking soda is applied you will see it bubble and foam as it reacts with the corrosion give the baking soda mix at least 5 10 minutes to soak in and loosen the corrosion 5 x research source be careful while you re applying the paste although baking soda is generally safe you should take care not to get it on other car components scrape off corrosion deposits with an old butter knife if your battery terminals have heavy deposits use the sharper edge of a used butter knife to scrape them off hold the knife s blade at a 45 degree angle and press it downward along the surface of the battery to chip off bits of corrosion after you have removed the major deposits use a wire brush or steel wool to remove any remaining deposits 6 x research source wear vinyl dishwashing gloves while cleaning the terminals especially if you re scrubbing off corrosion with steel wool your hands will be coming in direct contact with potentially caustic agents and vinyl gloves are the best protection 7 x research source there are special battery post and battery clamp brushes available at most auto parts stores but these are not necessary in most cases a general steel brush works fine rinse the battery with water once you ve brushed it clean when the baking soda mixture stops foaming and there are no major deposits left to be scraped off you can go ahead and rinse all of the corrosion dust and drying baking soda off of the battery pour about 2 cups 470 ml of distilled water over the battery and the positive and negative terminals 8 x research source be careful not to rinse the baking soda paste into the battery vents as the baking soda can neutralize the battery s acid and shorten the battery s life the vents are located on the sides of the battery and are connected to long vent tubes that direct harmful gases away from the vehicle s cabin wipe the terminals clean with a clean dry rag dry the entire battery thoroughly before reconnecting it to your vehicle make sure that the terminals are completely dry by rubbing the dry rag over them 2 3 times be sure to use a rag that doesn t have any grease or oil on it 9 x research source don t use paper towels for this step the paper will shred leaving you with bits of paper towel stuck to your battery terminals smear petroleum jelly onto the clean terminals to prevent corrosion dip 2 fingers into a jar of petroleum jelly and smear a thin layer across both the positive and negative terminals make sure your vinyl gloves are still on while you do this applying hydrophobic petroleum jelly to the now cleaned terminals will prevent corrosion from occurring again in the future 10 x research source if you don t already have petroleum jelly at your home purchase some at a drugstore or pharmacy reattach the 2 clamps back on to the battery to complete the cleaning you need to reattach the clamps that you removed earlier to secure the battery in place and restore the electrical connection reattach the positive clamp to the battery first by tightening it with a wrench once it s firmly in place then you can attach the negative clamp to the negative terminal on the battery use a wrench to tighten that clamp in place as well 11 x research source once the clamps are on replace the rubber or plastic shields covering the clamp terminal junction examine the battery cradle s terminals and the battery for corrosion open the device s cover to access the battery cradle remove the battery cover to inspect the degree of corrosion assess these old batteries for cracks and leakage mild corrosion will appear as black spots more severe corrosion appears as a white ashy deposit around one or both battery posts or terminals 12 x research source if you find a battery that s leaking acid and not merely corroded throw it away immediately any leakage is likely potassium hydroxide a strong base be sure to wear skin and eye protection when cleaning out the battery cradle as potassium hydroxide is caustic if a device is powered by more than 1 battery it s possible for 1 battery to be corroded and another to be in fine shape pull out any non corroded batteries and set them aside you ll reinsert them later once you ve cleaned off corroded batteries and the cradle the following baking soda cleaning method is just for any corrosion around the terminals not for a leaking battery mix together baking soda and water to make a cleaning paste make your cleaning agent by combining 2 3 tablespoons 30 44 ml of baking soda with 1 tablespoon 15 ml of water stir the components with a spoon to make a thick paste 13 x research source take care not to get baking soda on other electronic components e g whatever electrical device the batteries that you are cleaning were housed in rub any corrosion off of the battery terminals with a cotton swab dip a cotton swab into the baking soda mixture smear the baking soda paste onto the battery connections and the 2 terminals at the end of each battery using the cotton swab once the baking soda is applied you may see it bubble and foam as it reacts with the corrosion let it soak in for about 5 minutes 14 x research source wear vinyl dishwashing gloves while cleaning any battery corrosion take care not to touch with bare skin the white crusty buildup as it is caustic and could burn your skin be careful not to get any water on your electronics when cleaning wipe the battery and cradle off with distilled water and a cotton swab when the foaming stops and there are no major deposits left to be scraped out you re ready to rinse off the inside of the cradle dip 1 clean cotton swab into a cup of distilled water then dab the cotton swab back and forth along the inside of the battery cradle this will clear out any lingering baking soda and clean the connections so they re ready to receive electrical current 15 x research source be careful not to get any water any electrical components or you could damage the electrical equipment wait 15 20 minutes for the battery and cradle to dry out install the cleaned batteries and close the cradle put the cleaned batteries into the now clean battery cradle if you set aside un corroded batteries earlier fetch them and put them inside the battery cradle as well then close up the case or put back on the cover put some pressure on the plastic cover to make sure that it s firmly in place 16 x research source you re now ready to resume using your electronics,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to use a torque wrench,a torque wrench is a special tool designed to accurately tighten nuts and bolts to specific levels it is almost universally used to work on cars and bikes and it can only be used to tighten something torque wrenches are adjusted by hand so you don t need any other tools to operate one to use a torque wrench adjust the handle and set it to a specific level of torque use the tightener on the end of the handle to lock it in place then fit it over the socket nut or bolt and turn it clockwise to tighten it when you re done turn the settings on the handle back to 0 and store it somewhere safe get your torque wrench calibrated at least once a year to ensure that the hash marks remain accurate,loosen the tightener at the end of the wrench s handle look at the end of your wrench s handle to find the tightener that locks the settings in place it is usually a plastic or metal cap that is stuck into the end of your wrench often it is a different color than the rest of your wrench as well twist it counterclockwise by hand to loosen the piece so that you can change the wrench s settings 1 x research source you don t need to take it off of your wrench just loosen it until you don t feel a ton of resistance find and identify the torque measurements on your wrench inspect the area near your handle to find the hash marks for the torque setting there will be 1 set of larger numbers on the body of the wrench and 1 set of smaller numbers on the handle the smaller numbers are the smaller digits while the larger numbers are the larger units 2 x research source torque is measured in foot pounds or meter kilograms ft lb or m kg your torque wrench will list 2 sets of numbers on the wrench s hash marks the lower number is the measurement in foot pounds the larger number is the measurement in meter kilograms the vertical location of the edge of the handle determines the baseline while the rotation of the handle determines the smaller digits there is a center line on the wrench to show where the handle is set for example if the edge of the handle is on the hash mark for 100 and the smaller number on the handle itself is turned to 5 the torque setting for the wrench is 105 ft lb 1397 m kg turn the dial to raise or lower the torque setting on the wrench with the tightener loosened brace the body of the wrench with your nondominant hand turn the handle clockwise to raise it or counterclockwise to lower it once you reach the desired hash mark stop turning the handle 3 x research source if you need to reach a specific number raise the handle to the hash mark that is within 5 ft lb 200 m kg of your number so if you know you need to reach 140 ft lb 1860 m kg raise the handle to the hash mark between 135 145 ft lb 1795 1928 m kg some torque wrench handles are slide up and down instead of twisting into place twist the dial on the handle to make minor adjustments once you re close to the desired number turn your attention from the height of the handle to the dial itself follow the readings as you turn the handle slowly as you turn clockwise the number goes up as you turn counterclockwise the number goes down 4 x research source there are a few negative numbers after 0 so that you can move down a little as well on some wrenches the dial moves independently of the handle and you can twist it by turning the dial not the handle add the smaller digit on the handle to the number on the larger hash mark to determine total torque once you ve adjusted the handle s height and twisted the dial calculate your total torque to ensure that it s accurately adjusted by adding the numbers together take the hash mark on your handle and add the number marked on the dial to get your torque so if the dial reads 4 and the handle reads 50 your total torque is 54 ft lb 718 m kg 5 x research source you add the negative numbers as well for example if your hash mark is 120 and the dial is 2 you add 120 to 2 to get 118 ft lb 1569 m kg screw the tightener back into the end of the wrench by hand to lock it to lock a torque setting into the wrench flip it back over to the handle brace the wrench in your nondominant hand to keep it still twist the tightener clockwise by hand until it won t move any more this will lock the handle in place 6 x research source once you lock the tightener you cannot adjust your torque setting put your socket on the head of your wrench to use your torque wrench start by sliding a socket that matches your nut or bolt into the head of your torque wrench if you have an extender or adaptor that you re using you can slide that into the opening at the head instead 7 x research source torque wrenches come in different sizes but the sockets are almost always interchangeable torque wrenches are expensive so they rarely come in a single size turn the nut or bolt by hand until it catches the threading on the screw take the nut or bolt that you re going to tighten and place it over the threading for the screw or opening on your vehicle by hand turn the vehicle s nut or bolt clockwise with your fingers until the threading catches the threading on the screw turn the nut or bolt until it won t turn by hand anymore 8 x research source fit the socket on top of the nut or bolt that you re tightening with the nut or bolt set on the threading hold the handle of the torque wrench in your nondominant hand use your dominant hand to guide the socket adaptor or extender on to the nut or bolt slide the wrench over the nut or bolt until the 2 pieces are flush 9 x research source turn the handle clockwise to tighten the nut or bolt rotate the handle clockwise to begin tightening the nut or bolt almost all torque wrenches have automatic return functions so you don t need to reposition them on the nut or bolt for this type of wrench simply move it counterclockwise to reset it if you have a manual wrench reposition it on the nut or bolt to continue torquing it down 10 x research source if you hear a clicking or switching noise when you return the handle counterclockwise you have an automatically returning torque wrench stop turning the wrench when it starts clicking or stops moving if your automatic wrench clicks when you re returning it keep tightening the nut or bolt if it starts clicking when you turn it clockwise though stop tightening the nut or bolt the clicking noise while tightening indicates that you have reached your desired torque level on a manual wrench stop turning it when you feel the wrench resisting 11 x research source so if you have the handle adjusted to 100 ft lb 1330 m kg of torque the bolt is tightened to that level the moment it starts clicking when you try to tighten it manual wrenches will simply stop moving after the nut or bolt has been turned to the intended level of torque dial the wrench back to zero when you re done using it when you re done using the wrench turn both dial settings on the handle back to 0 leaving the dial turned to a torque setting higher than 0 can throw the calibration off over time 12 x research source turning the wrench to negative numbers is equally as bad for your wrench clean dirty or rusty nuts or bolts before loosening them one of the easiest ways to damage your wrench is to allow rust and grime buildup inside your sockets this makes it harder for your torque wrench to get an adequate grip on the socket and can cause a lot of problems over time clean each bolt or nut that you plan on tightening with a towel or rag before attaching your wrench 13 x research source torque wrenches aren t meant to be lubricated get any grease or lubricant off of your bolt or nut by using a degreaser before attaching a socket get your wrench calibrated at least once a year unless you have years of experience working on cars it s best to have a mechanic or torque wrench specialist calibrate your torque wrench for you when using your torque wrench a discrepancy will naturally develop between the measurements on your handle and the actual torque of the wrench fix this problem and prevent dangerous scenarios by getting your wrench calibrated once a year 14 x research source calibration usually costs between 25 75 usd,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to change an alternator,the vehicle s alternator supplies power to recharge the battery and operate its electronics if your vehicle begins showing signs of reduced power like dimming headlights or interior lighting you can have your alternator tested for free at most auto parts stores if it can t produce enough current to keep your battery charged and car running it will need to be replaced,park the car on an even level surface any time you plan to work on your vehicle safety is paramount because you may need to jack the vehicle up make sure it s parked on a surface that s suitable for the work it should be evenly paved and flat 1 x research source even if you don t have the jack the car up it s easier to work on an even surface ensure the vehicle is park or has the parking brake engaged if equipped with a standard transmission disconnect the battery find the right socket to loosen the bolt that keeps the cable on the negative terminal tight it s the terminal of the battery with a visible sign once it s loose slide the cable off the terminal to disconnect the battery never work in the engine bay of a vehicle without first disconnecting the battery for safety 2 x research source working on the alternator without disconnecting the battery could result in getting shocked or damaging the vehicle you can leave the positive cable attached jack the vehicle up if necessary follow the serpentine or accessory belts to locate the alternator in your engine bay depending on the vehicle it may be on the top closest to you or it may be on one of the sides and difficult to access if you can t easily access it from the engine bay you ll need to jack up the vehicle 3 x research source be sure the parking brake is on and the wheels are blocked before you jack it up insert jack stands beneath the vehicle for safety once it s jacked up remove the main power cable from the alternator the main power cable will be the thick cable attached to the alternator that runs from the battery depending on how much space you have in your specific vehicle you may be able to use a ratchet but in some you may only be able to fit an open ended wrench unscrew the bolt holding it in place and pull it from where it s connected 4 x research source the bolts will likely require standard sized sockets or wrenches in american made vehicles and metric in most foreign applications the only other cable running to the alternator connects to a harness so it will be easy to identify set the bolt aside someplace safe until you install the new alternator release the safety clip connecting the wiring harness the only other wiring heading into the alternator is the control harness use your finger or a flat head screwdriver to release the clip holding the harness together then slide it apart 5 x research source be careful if you use a screwdriver to get to hard to reach clips so you don t break the plastic tuck the loose wire aside so it doesn t snag on the alternator when you remove it relieve tension on the belt with the auto tensioner if equipped some vehicles use the alternator itself to apply tension to the serpentine or accessory belt but others use an auto tensioner pulley insert the square drive from a breaker bar into the hole in the auto tensioner pulley and apply pressure in a clockwise direction to relieve tension on the belt 6 x research source you can tell if your vehicle uses an auto tensioner by looking at the alternator mounting bracket if the bolts can slide from side to side in the bracket it does not have an auto tensioner you will need to slide the belt off the alternator pulley before you release the auto tensioner in some cars you might need a friend to relieve the tension while you remove the belt loosen the bolts on the alternator if there is no auto tensioner in cars without an auto tensioner pulley you can relieve the tension on the belt simply by loosening the two bolts that secure the alternator to the engine these will often require a 14mm or 1 2 inch 1 3 cm socket though you may need to try others 7 x research source as you loosen the bolts the alternator will slide in the bracket under the tension of the belt you may not need to remove the serpentine or accessory belt if it s not damaged inspect the serpentine belt for damage look for signs of glossing or glazing shinier portions on the edges and underside of the belt inspect both the top and underside for signs of cracking as well if you find any of those issues you ll need to replace it remove the alternator from the engine bay with the belt pulled off of the alternator pulley and the wires disconnected the alternator should come out freely 8 x research source you may need to wiggle the alternator around some things in order to remove it keep track of how you worm the alternator out of the engine bay to help squeeze the new one in compare the new alternator to the old one before installing the new alternator set it down on a table next to the old one you just removed make sure the mounting holes and wire connectors are in the same place and that the two parts are the same size 9 x research source even if you provided specific information when purchasing the alternator this step is important to make sure they provided you with the correct part if they don t match return the new alternator to the auto parts store to get the correct replacement slide the new alternator into place you might have to wiggle the alternator around to squeeze it back into place in a crowded engine bay be sure to hold loose wires or the serpentine belt out of the way as you get it into place 10 x research source be careful not to trap any wiring behind the alternator as you slide it into place watch out for the serpentine belt as you slide the alternator into place to be sure you don t damage it insert the mounting bolts slide the mounting bolts through the alternator and into the mounting bracket tighten them by hand until they re snug in cars with an auto tensioner pulley you can completely tighten the bolts at this point otherwise keep the bolts loose 11 x research source you ll need to tighten the belt using the alternator later if you don t have an auto tensioner make sure the bolts are snug enough to hold the alternator in place but loose enough to slide side to side in the bracket run the belt over the new alternator pulley either install the new belt or run the old belt back through all of the appropriate pulleys if you aren t sure how to properly route the belt look for a diagram on the body of the car inside the engine bay to guide you the belt will need to go around any accessories it is supposed to power in your specific vehicle 12 x research source if there is no diagram stuck in the engine bay you may also be able to find the diagram in your vehicle owner s manual you might also be able to find the diagram on the manufacturer s website apply tension to the alternator with a pry bar if necessary if your vehicle does not have an auto tensioner pulley apply pressure to the alternator using a large screwdriver or pry bar until the belt is tight place the pry bar between the alternator and the engine and push the alternator out away from the engine 13 x research source be careful not pinch or cut any wires with the screwdriver or pry bar you or a friend will need to continue applying pressure until the bolts are tightened tighten the bolts and the belt with tension on the belt applied via the alternator and pry bar use the appropriate socket and a ratchet to tighten the two mounting bolts up the rest of the way this will allow the alternator to keep the tension on the belt 14 x research source make sure that the serpentine belt has less than an inch of play back and forth once installed if the belt is a little loose loosen the bolts and apply pressure again using the pray bar while you tighten them up connect the power cable and monitor harness reconnect the wire harness and insert the bolt that secures the main power cable to the alternator in the same order you removed them they should install exactly as they were in the old alternator 15 x research source make sure the primary power cable is tightened firmly onto the new alternator be sure you hear an audible click from the wiring harness to ensure it s seated snugly reconnect the battery with the new alternator in place all you have left to do is reconnect the negative lead to the battery make sure you tighten it firmly so it can t shake loose while driving 16 x research source if the battery is dead you may need to jump start it if the vehicle is jacked up remove the jack stands and lower it,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to clean an automotive paint gun,the following is a step by step instruction on how to clean an automotive paint gun,remove the air regulator from the paint the air regulator is the device at the bottom of the gun where compressed air can be hooked up to the bottom of the air gun make sure that the compressed air source is disconnected from the regulator first and then you can disconnect the regulator from the gun 1 x research source open the lid from the paint cup to pour out any unused material you need to make sure you dispose of the waste in the proper containers there should be at least two containers for the unused material hardened catalyzed material this means any materials that do not stay a liquid form but turn into a solid material base coat liquid material this means the any material that stays in liquid form using paper towels wipe as much left over material from the cup and lid of the cup as possible by wiping out the excess material will make cleaning out the cup and lid a lot easier with the thinner bear in mind that when drying with paper towels paint thinner is a corrosive liquid and easily able to deteriorate and soften the towels being used 2 x research source pour a small amount fill gun throat to overflowing of waste thinner into the cup waste thinner is also referred to as recycled thinner it is paint thinner that has been used before the throat of the gun is in the inside at the very bottom of the cup shake the paint gun vigorously ensuring to coat the inside of the cup with thinner to elaborate this is to make sure that all the remaining paint or base coat is dissolved by the thinner run used thinner into waste thinner container through the fluid nozzle to do this you point the nozzle into the container and squeeze the trigger like you would in normal operation wipe down all parts with paper towels until dry repeat steps four through seven at least once or until satisfied with initial cleaning remove the paint cup by turning it counter clock wise until it comes off remove the paint cup lid as well remove the fluid needle to avoid bending or damaging the needle during the removal of other parts to do this first remove the fluid adjustment knob located on the rear of the gun it is generally the middle knob although this can vary depending on model clean all parts with waste thinner as you remove them 3 x research source take the now revealed spring out press on the trigger and pull the fluid needle straight out again clean all parts with waste thinner as you remove them remove the air cap on the front of the paint gun by turning it counter clock wise until it comes off then using the paint gun key find the correct size for the fluid nozzle and remove the fluid nozzle by turning counterclockwise to reiterate clean all parts with waste thinner as you remove them when satisfied with secondary cleaning wipe dry and begin rinse with clean thinner 4 x research source rinse gun body cup lid air cap and all parts that have remaining paint excluding any gaskets though this process can be quite repetitive doing so well only save you from future headaches and you can be assured a clean paint gun dry all parts with clean paper towels and if available compressed air use the compressed air to clean holes and moving parts that can t be reached with just wiping last make sure gun is completely dry after using compressed air as excess liquids can be blown back onto the surfaces from the pressure on crevices and moving parts reassemble the gun and parts lubricate moving parts and threads as you replace them you want these parts to be oiled to prevent sticking or seizing of removable and non removable mechanical moving parts wipe any excess oil off the gun with clean paper towels after you have finished the gun is ready for use or storage after all steps have been completed begin final clean up start by making sure all waste material is contained in appropriate containers away from any heat source next make sure all work stations and tools are clean and put away after completion of this step you have a clean contaminant free paint gun and work station,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to change fuses in a car,learn how to quickly and safely change the fuses in your car and get back on the road without letting a dealership or mechanic get the best of you,make sure it s a fuse issue when one circuit has too much electricity flowing through it the fuse blows to prevent serious damage and even fire the best way of knowing if a fuse has blown is if an electric component instantly stops working i e window stops while rolling up or down radio stops workings or all of the dash lights go out at once if an electric component has been slowly getting worse it is not likely a fuse but it is still good to check the fuses regularly 1 x research source find the fuse panel 2 x research source the owner s manual will tell where the vehicle s fuse panel is most models situate the fuse panel on the driver s side of the dashboard and under the steering wheel but location varies from vehicle to vehicle remove the fuse panel s cover there will be several different color coded fuses plugged in these colors along with the numbers stamped on the fuses indicate different amperage ratings on the backside of the fuse panel there will be a diagram that shows which fuse corresponds with which electrical component if the owner s manual is unavailable try contacting a dealership for the location or a simple internet search can provide enough information to locate the fuse panel and specific fuses 3 x research source try to test fuses before removing once the fuse panel is located remove the cover and locate the fuse puller most vehicles come with a small fuse puller but not all will have one before removing any fuses it is possible to test a fuse before removing it this requires either a continuity test light or a multi meter ohm meter 4 x research source test the suspect fuses to test a fuse without removing it using the two probes of either the test light or multi meter touch the two small metal tabs located on the top of the fuse these tabs can be tricky to connect to but once sure that the probes are making contact if the fuse has continuity test light lights up or has a resistance reading may read 0 or 0 001milli ohm then the fuse is good if these tools are unavailable simply use the fuse puller that was in the fuse panel or a small pair of pliers or just bare fingers to remove and visually inspect any fuses if the fuse is bad it needs to be replaced 5 x research source when replacing a fuse you must use a fuse that has the same amperage rating use the fuse panel diagram the numbered color coded fuses and the owner s manual to help you determine the correct amperage for your new fuse once you have the right fuse gently push it into the correct slot make sure it s completely installed and then put the fuse panel back on the car 6 x research source check the circuit once you are done replacing the fuse turn the ignition and check to see if the circuit giving you trouble is working correctly if it is working chances are you just had a temporary surge that blew the fuse if that s the case then you just solved the problem 7 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to put air in a tire,feeling a little run down lately flabby with no get up and go perhaps a little soft around the middle even it s a hard life being a tire no worries though we ll show your owner how to fill you and take care of you so you ll be in great shape for the road ahead did you know that inflating your car s tires the proper amount protects you against the leading cause of tire blowouts and helps maximize your gas mileage it does and it s easy to do we ll show you how,pick up a tire pressure gage you can find them at any auto parts store such as napa autozone checker kragen etc or big box stores like walmart costco target and others the pencil types look like little metal tubes and a ruler like gauge pops out the top showing the air pressure dial gauges give you a very clear readout of your tire s pressure digital gauges give you a lcd readout that requires no interpretation find the recommended pressure you can find this in the owner s manual on a sticker inside the driver side door jamb or in the glove compartment it may be the same for all four tires or the front and rear tires may be different it differs by model normally it will be in the range of 28 to 36 psi pounds per square inch or 195 to 250 kpa kilopascals you can also find the maximum tire pressure on the tires themselves but use this only if you can t find the vehicle s recommended numbers maximum doesn t necessarily translate to best a good rule of thumb is to set the tires to 32 psi then find the proper pressure and correct as needed check the tires when cool warm air expands and will give you a false reading of greater pressure remove the screw on cap from the valve this is the little black or silver stem poking out from your wheel remove the cap and put it where you won t lose it there are two kinds of valve stems rubber valve stems and metal valve stems that are on wheels equipped with tpms tire pressure monitoring systems attach the gauge place the plug end of the gauge squarely onto the valve stem and press down firmly it may hear the hissing of air escaping if so press harder until the hissing stops read the gauge as directed to determine the pressure if the tire pressure matches the recommended number replace the cap and move to the next tire repeat this process for all four tires plus the spare should you run flat it s not going to be helpful to have a flat spare find air if you need to add air to your tires and don t have a compressor laying about the house most people don t head for your nearest gas station make sure you bring a a couple dollars worth of quarters with you as a few minutes of compressed air can cost 1 00usd or more a handy device to have around the garage is a portable tire inflator that it plugs into the 12v power socket in your car it is available wherever tire pressure gauges are sold remove the valve cap this is the same cap and valve you used to check the pressure turn on the compressor this may be by a switch if using a home compressor or by plugging the machine with quarters for a service station compressor it ll start hissing place the hose nozzle squarely onto the valve stem press down firmly just like you did with the pressure gauge and squeeze the valve trigger if it hisses loudly press more firmly until the hissing stops or is minimized how much lower than normal your pressure was will determine how long you want to keep the compressor filling the tire most tire compressors have a sliding gauge coming out of the top that pops up when you release the valve trigger don t rely on it for total accuracy but as a general guideline to see if you re getting close to your desired psi when close use your own tire pressure gauge to check and either add more air in short 5 second bursts or use the gauge to press the pin inside the valve stem and let air out if you ve over filled the tire replace the cap when each tire has been inflated to the proper pressure replace the cap and repeat for all 4 tires plus the spare if you had to drive more than a couple miles to the service station your tires will warm up and the air pressure will increase as a result if your readings indicate that you need add for example 10psi to the tire then add 10psi no matter what the current reading says check a few hours later after the tires have cooled down to verify the correct inflation buy a bicycle tire pressure gauge automobile tire pressure gauges will not accurately reflect the much higher psi levels of bicycle tires use a hand pump follow the other steps outlined including checking the pressure when the tire s cold and following the bicycle manual s guidelines you can use an air compressor to fill bicycle tires make sure you pay close attention to what you are doing fill the tire in short bursts and check the pressure often until you reach the desired pressure check your pressure before every ride because of their size and dimensions bicycle tires react more quickly to changes in ambient air temperature and psi will drop in cooler weather for every 10 drop in temperature tire pressure will drop about 2 for example if you head out during the day riding on 100psi and the temp is 90 when you head home that night and it s now 60 your tire pressure will be about 94 psi enough change to be a noticeable difference don t over inflate a tire that rolls great at 100 psi on a smooth road will deliver a harder ride on rough road to help with traction on wet days drop your psi by about 10,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to use brake spring pliers,though many automobile enthusiasts like to do repair and maintenance work on their own vehicles it can be difficult without having the proper tools a common vehicle repair task like changing components of the brakes of a vehicle such as drums pads and rotors can be done with regular wrenches and screwdrivers however it is a much easier task if you have a pair of brake spring pliers brake spring pliers are made especially for automobile brake work and consist of two useful ends this useful tool is inexpensive and a must have for do it yourself mechanics learning how to use brake spring pliers can make your brake repair jobs easier and faster to complete,purchase a quality pair of brake spring pliers at your local automobile supply store you can also choose to purchase them online if you do not need them right away pull the car onto level solid ground it is important that your car does not sink or roll away while resting on a jack or on jack stands remove hubcaps from the wheels you will be working on if any of the wheels you will be working on has hubcaps use a wrench or screwdriver to remove them loosen the lug nuts with a lug wrench tire iron or impact wrench it is important to remember to loosen or break the lug nuts before you jack up the vehicle this way the weight of the vehicle is still on the wheels and it prevents them from spinning dangerously while you turn the lugs jack up the car once the lugs have been loosened it will be necessary to jack the care up so that the wheels can be removed as mentioned above this should be done on level concrete or some other hard level surface some important things to remember when jacking up the care are your owner s manual will recommend jacking points the most common way to elevate the car is a floor jack or trolley jack you should use jack stands to stabilize the car if you have access to a hydraulic lift it will save you time remove the wheels at this point the lugs may be loose enough to remove by hand if not finish removing the lugs with the lug wrench or impact wrench once the lugs are removed pull the wheel off of the wheelbase place wheels under the car as back up protection in case the jack stands fail remove the grease dust cap this cap will be in the center of the hub and can be removed by simply prying away from the hub this will expose the retaining nut 1 x research source pull out the cotter pin there will be a pin in front of the retaining nut that prevents the nut from loosening referred to as a cotter pin remove it by straightening the bent end of the pin and prying it out of its hole with pliers or a screwdriver 2 x research source remove the retaining nut using a wrench or ratchet turn the nut counter clockwise to the left to loosen it if the nut is stuck lubricate it with wd 40 or similar lubricant inspect the drum some drums have small bolts holding them to the hub if this is the case you will need to remove those bolts 3 x research source attempt remove the drum pull the drum straight off of the hub you may have to wiggle a little to get it started if the drum appears stuck and will not pull off you should check to make sure all bolts holding the drum to the hub are removed check to see if the drum is getting caught on the brake shoes 4 x research source retract the brake shoes this step is only necessary if your drum is getting caught on the brake shoes you will need to look on the back side of the backing plate the steel plate on which the brake components are mounted for a small rubber plug removing this plug will provide access to the brake shoe adjuster use a flat head screwdriver or a brake adjuster bar to retract the brake shoes the adjuster is designed to self adjust the shoes into a tightened position so loosening them may be tricky if the drum gets harder to turn as you adjust you are going in the wrong direction once the drum is removed you can continue remove the return springs with your brake spring pliers these springs attach to the brake shoe and the shoe anchor and hold tension on the brake shoe once the brake pedal is released they return the brake shoe to its original position to remove them use the round notched part of the brake spring pliers place the round part on the anchor pin the nob that the springs are hooked to and turn it until the notch catches the spring and then twist and pull to remove the spring 5 x research source remove the retaining rings that hold the brake shoes in place to do this lightly grip the outside of the retaining ring with pliers push in and twist until the ring comes off 6 x research source pull the brake shoe off at this point the shoe should easily pull away from the backing plate there will be another spring attached at the bottom of the shoe but it will no longer be tensioned so you can just slide it off of the shoe remove the emergency brake line one of the brake shoes will be connected to an emergency brake line to remove it pull the spring cover back and slide the cable sideways away from the shoe 7 x research source re install the emergency brake cable fasten the emergency brake cable to the replacement brake shoe on the same side your removed it pull up the cover again and slide the cable into the proper slot on the shoe it will look the same as the one you removed it from 8 x research source remove any parts from the old brake shoes and transfer them to the new brake shoes you will need to transfer the return spring at the top of the shoe and the small emergency brake spring near the center of the shoe if your vehicle has any other hardware on the brake shoe transfer it to the new one as well 9 x research source grease the backing plate you want to avoid squeaking and rubbing of the brake shoes for this reason you should grease any bare or rubbed spots on the backing plate 10 x research source slide the bottom spring onto the new brake shoe there will be a hook at the end of the spring and a slot in the bottom of the brake shoe hook the spring into that slot slide the show into place against the backing plate now it is time to put the first brake shoe back into place once you get it lined up hold it there until you can replace the retaining ring replace the retaining ring for the first shoe put the spring that goes with the retaining ring in place over the small rod that protrudes from behind the brake shoe place the ring over the spring and press in and twist until the ring slides over the rod and locks into place slide the bottom spring onto the second brake shoe now it is time to begin installing the second brake shoe again you are going to start with the bottom spring put the brake shoe into its proper place against the backing plate you will need to line it up with the adjusting spring lever fasten the adjusting spring onto the second brake shoe here you will use the flat end of your brake spring pliers to pry the spring into place and hook it at the top of the second brake shoe this will connect the two brake shoes replace the retaining ring for the second shoe follow the same procedure as you did with the first retaining ring place the spring first then push and twist the ring into place use two screwdrivers to set the adjusting screw this screw changes the position of the adjusting spring which in turn changes the position of the brake shoes since the new shoes are thicker than the old ones you will need to set the adjusting screw to account for that use one screwdriver to push the automatic adjuster assembly down and the other to twist the cog that loosens the adjuster put the drum back on slide the drum back onto the hub you will want to spin it and make sure that it has just a little drag if the drum does not spin then your shoes are too tight and you need to loosen them using the adjusting screw if the drum spins freely with no drag at all then your shoes are too loose and you will need to tighten them using the adjusting screw replace any bolts that hold the drum to the hub you may or may not have bolts to fasten your drum to the hub if you do they should be reinstalled now reinstall the retaining nut and cotter pin you want to tighten the retaining nut that holds the drum in place and also put the cotter pin back through the hole to keep the nut from loosening put the dust cap back on the dust cap should push right back into place make sure that it is snapped back into place tightly re install the wheels you should slide the wheels back onto the wheelbase and thread the lug nuts on tight enough to hold wheels in place while the car is still on the jack stands remove the jack stands and lower the vehicle to the ground using the floor jack do this slowly and carefully you do not want the vehicle to drop suddenly tighten the lugs to the specified torque once the weight is back on the wheels use a lug wrench or impact wrench to tighten the lugs to the proper torque specifications in your service manual add brake fluid if needed you should check your brake fluid and add more if needed anytime you do brake work test the brake before you drive your car you want to be sure that your new brake shoes are working properly,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to make battery cables,many people jump to blaming their battery when their car boat or another machine won t start but a quick checking of the entire system for corroded or cracked cables bad connections or rusty parts can often reveal issues with the electrical system beyond a bum battery making new battery cables isn t difficult however and you won t need complex machinery to do it,lift the hood and check the battery as well as all connected lines and cables for rust corrosion or bad connections before making new cables check which ones actually need to be replaced remove any snapped chipping weak crusty or otherwise bad looking cables so you know what needs to be replaced ensure you have the same gauges of terminals terminal lugs and cables on the cable should be a number with a slash in it like 2 0 followed by the letters awg the terminals should have this slashed number too this number is the gauge size the terminal may not however say awg make sure you purchase both a positive and negative terminal if your cables don t match the battery you can also get cable clamp adjusters which tighten around any cable to ensure it fits well non adjustable terminals or universal terminals should only be used as a temporary fix 1 x research source pick up the appropriate cable for your machine in the gauge size determined above different cables need to be used for different machinery while there are a lot of options out there the general strategy is easy to remember dry machines cars tractors etc need to use untreated copper wire wet machines boats jet skis etc need to use electroplated tinned strands to prevent rusting 2 x research source purchase a non acidic or active flux core roll of solder wire rosin core solder wire is the safest to use on your battery connections acidic connections or active core wires can cause issues and corrode the battery when exposed to electricity grab some rosin flux paste of fluid for the connections again ignoring acid or active flux pastes like the solder wire this paste is too corrosive to be useful with copper or tinned wired 3 x research source some companies actually sell terminals pre loaded with flux and solder alternatively use the bad cables to purchase replacement parts from your local auto shop or hardware store bring in the bad battery cables to ensure you get the right replacements for your car or boat if you don t know what to get if in doubt talk to a store clerk for help replacing parts bring in your car s make model and year to help them understand your specific motor you ll need two cable brass or tinned two terminal lugnuts two terminals solder rosin paste or fluid shrinkable sheathing cut in four 6 parts use a thick pair of cable cutters to smoothly clip the cables don t try saw at the cable with a knife of hacksaw as this makes for jagged uneven ends of cable that are hard to work with use a heavy duty set of cutters to get right through the cable in one short smooth motion 4 x research source cut away the final 1 or so of rubber housing to expose the cable cut lightly here trying your best to only cut the rubber housing and not the strands of cable underneath you can use your terminal lugs the piece that attached to the battery to estimate how much you should cut away simply line it up with the cable and note how long the hole is then cut away enough rubber so that the actual metal cable fits in snugly don t worry if you cut too much away you will be re sheathing the cables later using your fingers lightly pull off any loose or unwound strands from the cables before using removing these stray bits will slow down corrosion and greatly increase the life of your cable 5 x research source add two pieces of 4 5 shrink tubing to each cable shuffling it out of the way until later it is harder to get this sheathing on after the terminals are attached so slide it onto the wire now and roll it out of the way towards the center of the cable each one of these sheathings will cover the exposed metal at the ends of your cable when done 6 x research source liberally apply flux paste to the inside of the terminals and the exposed cables this paste is heated up and creates a strong electrical connections between the two bits apply the paste liberally with a cotton swab slide the terminal lug onto the expose cable end pushing it as far on as you can some of the flux will squeeze out but this is okay get the lug snugly onto the exposed cable for now 7 x research source crimp the terminal lug onto the cable using a flat nail punch or a crimper if you have a crimping machine now is the time to use it otherwise get a flat nail punch or angle iron and a hammer place the punch in the center of the nut then hammer hard into it to crimp the terminal into the cabling flip the cable and repeat on the other side using a flame or other high heat source such as from a butane torch heat the lug until the rosin flux is boiling you want to get the entire piece nice and hot you can stand a butane torch up turn it on and rotate the cable in front of the flame so the whole thing is evenly heated heat until the rosin starts to bubble out of the terminal lug this preheats everything to make soldering easier in the next step still applying heat solder around the connection between cable and terminal lug use your non acidic non reactive solder wire to solder the point where the terminal lug ends and the exposed cable begins you can do this right after you have the rosin boiling when done let it cool for 1 2 minutes before proceeding make sure you have enough heat to liquefy the solder slide the shrink tubing back up to cover the expose metal then use the heat source to shrink it around the connection all that needs to be exposed is the flat terminal lug which connects to the battery the rest of the connection should be covered and snugly fit with the sheathing to prevent corrosion clamp the terminals in a vice open side up the entire terminal is going to get very hot and you can t attach it and crimp it down ahead of time like the terminal lugs clamp it down so it won t move as you insert the hot cable and solder liberally swab the inside of the terminal and the outside of the cable with rosin flux the ingredients needed to attach the terminals are the exact same as those used for the lugs though the process is a bit different use a cotton swab to coat all parts of the terminal and wire that will connect if you bought pre soldered and pre rosined terminals you should skip this step using your torch heat the terminal so that the rosin flux is boiling make sure you do this in a well ventilated area you want big quick bubbles forming to know you have it boiling 8 x research source preheat the end of the cable for 12 15 seconds then push it into the terminal if both the cable and the terminal are hot the connection is going to be much faster and more secure solder the connection between terminal and wire just like the terminal lug solder the edge of the terminal to the expose wire beneath it even if you have pre soldered connections this isn t a terrible idea for added security use some wire

sheathing to cover exposed metal then heat it to shrink it on these sheathings will greatly increase the usable life of your battery cables 10 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to use a winch,off road driving with your vehicle can be exhilarating but sometimes you might find yourself stuck on some rocks or in a pit of mud fortunately if you have a winch mounted on your vehicle you shouldn t have any problem getting yourself unstuck to use your winch properly you ll need to locate a sturdy anchor to attach it to once your winch is rigged you can slowly pull your vehicle out from whatever it s stuck in,plug the winch remote control into the winch your winch should have come with a remote control attached to a long cord look for the plug at the end of the cord and attach it to the corresponding receptacle on the outside of the winch run the remote control cord from the winch to the driver s seat and place the remote control in your vehicle 1 x research source put on a pair of thick gloves never handle a winch cable without gloves on the cable could cut your hands 2 x research source find something in front of your car to anchor your winch to a large tree trunk boulder or other vehicle is ideal don t anchor your winch to something small and weak or you risk breaking it try to find an anchor that s straight in front of your vehicle 3 x research source use the disengage lever to release the winch cable the disengage lever should be located on the outside of the winch the lever should have an option that says free spool or disengaged turn the lever to that option this will release the cable so you re able to manually pull it out from the winch 4 x research source pull the winch cable all the way to the anchor don t pull too much of the cable out or you ll create unnecessary slack set the end of the cable down next to the anchor 5 x research source if the winch cable doesn t reach the anchor look for another anchor that s closer to your vehicle wrap a tree trunk protector around the bottom of the anchor a tree trunk protector is a thick nylon strap with two loops one on each end wrap the protector around the anchor so the two end loops are facing you hold the two end loops in your hand 6 x research source if your winch didn t come with a tree trunk protector you can order one online or find one at your local hardware store hook a d shackle through the 2 loops on the protector a d shackle is a curved shackle with a large pin that screws in and out of the shackle remove the pin from the d shackle and put the curved part of the d shackle through both of the loops on the tree trunk protector once the loops are on the shackle reinsert the pin and twist it to tighten it into place 7 x research source hook the winch hook to the d shackle with the tip facing up the winch hook is the hook at the end of the winch cable 8 x research source turn the disengage lever back to engaged you want the lever to be back in the position it started in before you released the winch cable this will prevent more cable from coming out of the winch 9 x research source use the winch remote to slowly pull the winch cable taut press the button on the remote control to start pulling the winch cable back into the winch this will cause the winch cable to tighten stop pressing the button when the cable is taut 10 x research source make sure everyone s cleared the area it s important that no one is standing behind or in front of your vehicle no one should be standing near the winch cable always double check before you start pulling with the winch people could be seriously injured if they re in the way 11 x research source get in the driver s seat of your vehicle grab the winch remote control from the front seat and hold it in your hand remain in the vehicle the whole time you re using the winch 12 x research source winch the vehicle slowly using the remote control don t try to pull your vehicle out quickly you want to work slow and steady press the button on the remote control to start pulling your car out you should feel your vehicle moving forward as it s pulled out from whatever it s stuck in release the button every few seconds and then resume winching this will keep you from going too fast 13 x research source while you re pulling your vehicle out with the winch gently press the gas pedal to help move your vehicle forward stop winching once your vehicle is on stable ground you ll know you re on stable ground once your vehicle is flat and you re able to drive it forward without the help of the winch with your finger off the winch remote control button gently press the gas pedal to see if you re able to drive forward unhook the winch cable from the d shackle leave the d shackle hooked to the tree trunk protector for now you ll come back and get those after you take care of the winch cable use the remote control to slowly rewind the winch cable hold the end of the winch cable in your hand and walk it back in toward the winch as you re rewinding the cable don t let the winch cable slide through your hands as you re rewinding it 14 x research source unplug the winch remote control from the winch wrap up the cord attached to the remote control store the remote control in a dry place in your vehicle 15 x research source retrieve the d shackle and tree trunk protector from the anchor remove the pin from the d shackle and slide the shackle off the loops on the protector reinsert the pin in the d shackle so you don t lose it store the d shackle and tree trunk protector in your vehicle 16 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to replace an automotive fuse,fuses are extremely important electronic components in your car fuses serve to protect the different electronic devices in case there is an unexpected power surge should something like this happen the fuse will blow and stop the extra electricity from reaching the particular device replacing a fuse is very easy and can be done by people with little or no prior experience,turn off the car the first and most important step before doing any electrical work on your car is to turn it off find the fuse box now you can proceed looking for the fuse box on most cars it is either in the glove box or under it you should not have to take anything apart in order to access it there will however be a cover that you just pop open but you won t need any tools for that a lot of cars have more than one fuse boxes there is a chance that the one you are looking for is not in the car in this case it is most likely located in the engine compartment find the cover after you have located the fuse box find the cover and remove it there must be a guide telling you what each fuse is for it is usually printed on the cover itself find the blown fuse if you have ever seen a regular light bulb that has burned out you will be to quickly identify the fuse you need to change it looks very similar because the metal strip that is inside will be broken apart from that the fuse might be slightly blackened remove the fuse it should be easy to just pinch it with your fingers but if it seems to be stuck or too difficult to grab with fingers you can use a small screwdriver or ideally the fuse remover that many cars come with this remover should be located in one of the slots don t throw the fuse away take it to a specialized store and ask for a replacement or just look at its specifications and get one online replace the fuse put the new one in the slot where the old one was and push it should easily snap into place test everything now that you have replace the fuse it is time to start the car and see if whatever the fuse was responsible for is now working whether it s your radio interior lights or fan for example replace the cover after you have made sure that everything works normally simply put the fuse box cover back on,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to take care of automotive batteries,it s very important not to let corrosion set it in on your battery terminals once corrosion sets in your car will randomly fail to start due to electrical contact being lost between battery and cable especially common with gm vehicles read on for more details,go to the auto parts store and acquire some battery terminal goo the stuff that prevents corrosion usually comes with a new battery better yet you can purchase some battery corrosion prevention spray it does the same thing and is easier to apply remove any rubber or plastic covers off of the battery terminals not the posts on top but the terminals on the side that the cables bolt on to do you see any blue or white powder corrosion forming anywhere if no put the covers back on and crack open a beer you re done if yes you see corrosion then you ve got work to do remove both battery terminals with a socket wrench make sure you remove the negative black cable first please watch what you re doing here don t short circuit the red terminal to any metal part of the engine or your going to be sorry just be cool when you ratchet the wrench back and forth get a wire brush and scrape off all the corrosion crud from the bolt the cable assembly and the battery terminal itself get inside the threads of the battery female connector make real sure you get all the crud off the cable assembly including the connectors i have had to cut off the rubber insulation so that i could get all the corrosion off just make sure to cut the rubber so that you can put it back on later tip pour boiling water over the corrosion before starting any other cleaning it will dissolve much of the deposits and wash them away dissolving some baking soda in the water will neutralize the acid in the crud wash down thoroughly with plenty of cold water afterwards check again to make sure you ve got every last bit of corrosion brushed off the corrosion is battery acid that has reacted with the air and metal if you don t get it off it continues to react and cause problems in fact some say it will slide down the cable assay insulation and force you to replace the whole assembly at considerable cost once everything s hunky dory and spotless then spread the goo or spray all the mating surfaces completely now you re ready to put it all together don t over tighten and strip the battery threads it s only soft lead after all put the positive red on first then the negative black,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to read an aviation routine weather report metar,aviators use metar reports to gain essential knowledge about flying conditions to a casual observer a report may look like a string of random and numbers but every report contains a lot of data these reports aren t tough to decode once you know what the look for after getting a report from an airport or weather center read the first few strings to figure out where the data came from the rest of the report will then contain information about visibility the weather and all sorts of other conditions if you need assistance look up a chart explaining common abbreviations to understand what kind of weather you will be facing when you re out on the runway,obtain a metar report from an airport aviation center these reports are often free and available even when you re not operating a plane check with your government s aviation office or national weather service online the aviation weather center in the u s for instance offers reports access reports at https www aviationweather gov metar 1 x research source to request a report from the weather center select a location you can also choose a time period if you wish to access a past report use the initial code letters to identify the type of report if you re looking at a metar report you will see it listed at the beginning there are other types of reports as well each type of report conveys different information distinguish between these types of reports to get weather details you need 2 x research source metar reports are routine hourly reports a new metar report is issued at the end of each hour speci indicates a special unscheduled report speci reports usually happen for special conditions like low visibility and thunderstorms taf means terminal aerodrome forecast tafs are similar to metars but less common and used to provide a forecast for a general area note the station identifier after the report type the id tag will look something like kaff k represents a location in the us the letters after it tell you which station the report came from every country and station has its own identifying code given out by the world meteorlogical organization 3 x research source kaff for instance represents the air force academy in colorado egll is the code for london heathrow e represents the uk while gll stands for heathrow airport rjaa represents tokyo narita airport read the next numbers to find the report s date and time look for a series of 6 numbers followed by a z such as 212355z the first pair of numbers stands for the day of the month the rest of the code represents the time in zulu also called universal or greenwich mean time note that the report doesn t include information about the month or year it was issued 4 x research source for example in 212355z 21 shows you that the report came on the 21st day of the month it happened at 2355z zulu which would be 1755 or 11 55 am in colorado springs look for a short phrase explaining how the report was modified in the example the modifier is indicated by cor if it is present the modifier information is always listed after the time and date you can tell it apart from the rest of the report by how short it is it also doesn t have any numbers in it unlike the codes before and after it 5 x research source auto means the report came from an automated station cor tells you that someone corrected the initial report a manual observer changed something the automated station got wrong you won t see a modifier for reports issued by a person if no one is on duty at the station then you may start seeing automated reports view the first 3 digits of the next code for the wind s direction the next code a combination of letters and numbers is all about the wind the wind s direction is listed according to true north true north means the direction of the earth s axis not the magnetic north you see when you look at a compass true north can be found using maps or a compass 6 x research source in the code vrb05kt vrb represents the wind s direction vrb means that the wind direction varies the first letters of the code could also be something like 120 picture a compass where 0 degrees is at the top and 180 degrees is at the bottom a 120 means the wind is blowing from the southeast use the remaining digits in the wind code for wind speed the wind direction is always followed by 2 or 3 numbers indicating the wind s speed the speed is listed in knots or kt you may also see some additional letters from time to time describing how hard the wind is blowing 7 x research source in the code vrb05kt the 05kt means that the wind is blowing at a speed of 5 knots you might see the letter g in the middle of the wind report for example g26kt stands for gusts of wind blowing at 26 knots the letter v tells you that a strong wind blowing at more than 6 knots varies in direction for example you might see 180v260 the wind is changing direction between 180 and 260 degrees check the short wind visibility code to determine air quality the wind visibility code consists of a short series of numbers usually accompanied by a unit of measurement in the u s wind visibility is often measured in statute miles for reports outside of the u s expect to see the visibility listed in meters 8 x research source a visibility of 15sm means you can see for about 15 miles 24 km the visibility can also be listed as a fraction if it looks like 1 1 2sm that means the visibility is 1 ½ miles a visibility in measured in meters may be listed as something like 1400 the unit of measurement won t be listed but you can tell it s in meters because mile measurements don t usually go higher than 30 read strings starting with r for runway visibility a string of letters and numbers like r36l 2400ft tells you everything you need to know about the runway runway information isn t in every report if you don t see it following the air visibility code then expect clear conditions on the ground the runway visibility will tell you how far you can see from the runway 9 x research source the first set of numbers indicates what runway the report covers r36 means runway 36 areas with parallel runways have a marker like l which means the left runway the second number explains the visibility distance in a code containing 2400ft the visibility is 2 400 ft 730 m view the present weather conditions if they are listed in the report the codes following the wind information explain any significant weather conditions in the area it can include precipitation weather intensity and other factors that affect navigation there are many different signs so consider looking up a chart to interpret the listing for instance try the chart at https www weather gov media wrh mesowest metar_decode_key pdf 10 x research source intensity descriptor precipitation obscuration other light mi shallow dz drizzle br mist po dust sand whirls moderate no qualifier bc patches ra rain fg fog sq squalls heavy dr low drifting sn snow fu smoke fc funnel cloud vc in the vicinity bl blowing sg snow grains du dust fc tornado or waterspout sh showers ic ice crystals sa sand ss sandstorm ts thunderstorm pl ice pellets hz haze ds duststorm fz freezing gr hail py spray pr partial gs small hail or snow pellets va volcanic ash up unknown precipitation for example you may see shra it stands for light rain showers a code of tsra means thunderstorms with heavy rain use the 3 letters starting the 6 digit codes to determine cloud coverage sky condition codes start with 3 letters and end with 3 numbers the letters tell you the amount of sky covered by clouds a metar report can have more than 1 code describing the different groups of clouds so be sure to read the entire report for instance the report may include few040 sct060 sct075 sct090 bkn220 11 x research source skc is the clear sky code for manually generated reports automated reports use clr for elevations under 12 000 ft 3 700 m few means there aren t many clouds to worry about the clouds cover ⅛ to 2 8 of the sky sct indicates for scattered clouds meaning ⅜ to 4 8 of the sky is covered bkn stands for broken in broken conditions ⅝ to ⅞ of the sky will be covered overcast days come with the code ovc the sky will be totally covered by clouds when you see this code read the following numbers to determine how high the clouds are the numbers measure the height of the base of the clouds this information is listed as hundreds of feet above the ground if the clouds seem to continue on indefinitely then you will see the letters vv to show vertical visibility you may also see letters attached at the end of the code describing special types of clouds 12 x research source for instance bkn220 tells you that the clouds are at 22 000 ft 6 700 m all you have to do is add a pair of 0s onto the end of the code to figure out the cloud height you may also see something like bkn220tcu the tcu stands for towering cumulonimbus cb means cumulonimbus clouds which are usually present during storms acc is altocumulus castellanus view the temperature and dew point marked by a combined number the temperature and dew point numbers are separated by a slash the first number tells you the temperature in degrees celsius the number after the slash lists the dew point in celcius for example you may see 15 moi on a report 13 x research source in 15 m01 the temperature is 15 c 59 f an m before the dew point means minus a dew point listed as m01 corresponds to 01 check the altimeter setting by the code starting with an a the a stands for altimeter so you can always recognize this code listed after the temperature the code describes the atmospheric pressure in the area it will either be listed as inches of mercury or hectopascals pilots use this information to ensure the plane s altimeter is displaying the correct altitude 14 x research source a2957 is an example of an altimeter setting it corresponds to 29 57 inches of mercury or 29 57 hg generally reports list the altimeter setting in hg reports outside the u s may occasionally use a code like q1030 or 1030 hectopascals check the remarks for any additional information added to the report the remarks section is for anything else the reporter thinks you need to know a metar report may have very few additional comments or it may have a bunch these comments can include information about when a thunderstorm began or ended the type of station making the report air pressure or any other notes there are many different remarks that could be added so be sure to look at a guide like https weather cod edu notes metar html for instance acsl means altocumulus standing lenticular clouds then dsnt tells you the clouds are distant beyond 10 miles away the code se s shows that they are southeast by south the code slp960 indicates the sea level pressure in tenths of millibars or hectopascals a code of shra dsnt n e se and dsnt nw indicates moderate rain showers in the distant north through east through southeast and the distant northwest general numbers like 60001 55000 usually represent automated maintenance data you don t need to bother with trying to decipher them last cor stands for last correction a number of 43 tells you the correction was made at 43 minutes past the hour,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to survive a plane crash,the chances of dying on a commercial airline flight are actually as low as 9 million to 1 that said a lot can go wrong at 33 000 feet 10 058 4 m above the ground and if you re unlucky enough to be aboard when something does the decisions you make could mean the difference between life and death almost 95 of airplane crashes have survivors so even if the worst does happen your odds aren t as bad as you might think you can learn to prepare for each flight safety stay calm during the crash itself and survive the aftermath,dress comfortably you ll need to be able to stay warm if you survive a crash even if that is not a consideration the more of your body is covered during impact the less likely you are to receive serious injuries or burns wear long pants a long sleeve t shirt and sturdy comfortable lace up shoes 1 x research source loose or elaborate clothing poses a risk as it can get snagged on obstacles in the close confines of a plane if you know you re going to be flying over cold areas dress appropriately and consider keeping a jacket on your lap cotton or wool clothing is also preferable as it is less flammable wool is preferable to cotton when flying over water as wool does not lose its insulating properties to the degree cotton does when wet wear sensible shoes although you may want to be comfortable or professional looking on a flight sandals or high heels make it hard to move quickly should there be an emergency high heels are not allowed on the evacuation slides and you can cut your feet and toes on glass or get flammable liquids on or in your sandals if you wear them 2 x research source sit in the tail of the aircraft passengers in the tail of the aircraft have 40 higher survival rates than those in the first few rows in the event of a crash because a quick escape gives you the best chance for survival it s best to get seats as close as possible to an exit on the aisle and in the back of the plane 3 x research source yes it s actually statistically safer to fly economy than first class save money and stay safer read the safety card and listen to the pre flight safety speech yes you may have heard it all before and you ll probably never need it but if you keep your headphones on during the pre flight instructions or ignore the safety card you ll be missing out on information that could be vital in the event of a crash don t assume you know it all already either every type of airplane has different safety instructions 4 x research source if you re sitting in an exit row study the door and make sure you know how to open it if you need to in normal circumstances the flight attendant will open the door but if they are dead or injured you ll need to do it count the number of seats between your seat and the exit row find the exit closest to you and count the number of seats that it ll take to get to it if the plane crashes it could be smoky loud or confusing in the cabin afterward if you need to escape you might have to feel your way to the exit which will be a lot easier if you know where it is and how far you might even write down the number in pen on your hand so you ll have a quick reference if you need to keep your seat belt on at all times every centimeter of slack in your seat belt triples the g force you ll experience in the crash so keep your seat belt properly tightened at all times you re on the aircraft push the belt down as low over your pelvis as possible you should be able to feel the upper ridge of the pelvis above the upper edge of the belt which helps to brace you in an emergency much better than your soft stomach leave your belt on even if you re sleeping if something happens while you re out you ll be glad to have the restraints in place assess the situation try to determine what surface the plane will land on so you can customize your preparations if you re going to be landing in water for example you ll want to put your life vest on though you need to wait to inflate it until you re out of the plane if you re going to be landing in cold weather you should try to get a blanket or jacket to keep you warm once outside plot out the general course you ll be on ahead of time so you ll have some idea of where you are when the plane crashes if you re flying from iowa to california you can be fairly certain you won t be landing in the ocean use the time before the crash to find your exit if the plane is going to crash you almost always have several minutes to prepare before impact use this time to once again review where the exits are prepare your space as much as possible if you know you re going to crash return your seat back to its full upright position and stow away any loose items that could become hazardous if at all possible zip up your jacket and make sure your shoes are tied tightly to your feet then assume one of two standard brace positions used for surviving a plane crash and try to remain calm 5 x research source in either position your feet should be flat on the floor and further back than your knees to reduce injuries to your feet and legs which you will need in order to successfully exit the craft after impact place your legs as far under the seat as possible to avoid breaking your shin bones brace yourself against the seat in front of you if the seat in front of you is close enough to reach place one hand palm down on the back of that seat then cross the other hand palm down over the first hand rest your forehead against your hands keep your fingers unlaced it s also sometimes recommended that you put your head directly against the seat in front of you and lace your fingers behind your head tucking your upper arms against the sides of your head to cradle it bend forward if there s no seat in front of you if you don t have a seat close in front of you bend forward and put your chest on your thighs and your head between your knees cross your wrists in front of your lower calves and grab your ankles try and remain calm it can be easy to get swept up in the pandemonium immediately preceding and following a crash keep a cool head though and you re more likely to get out alive remember that even in the worst wrecks you do have a chance of survival you ll need to be able to think methodically and rationally to maximize that chance put on your life jacket but do not inflate it in the case of a crash in water if you inflate it in the plane when it starts to fill up with water the life jacket will force you upwards against the cabin roof and it will be very hard to swim back down leaving you trapped instead hold your breath and swim out once you re out inflate it 6 x research source put your oxygen mask on before assisting others you ve probably heard this on every commercial flight you ve been on but it s worth repeating if the integrity of the cabin is compromised you have only about 15 seconds or less to start breathing through your oxygen mask before you are rendered unconscious 7 x research source while you may feel an impulse to first help your children or the elderly passenger sitting next to you you ll be no good to anyone if you don t remain conscious also remember that you can put somebody else s oxygen mask on even if they re unconscious this might help save their life protect yourself from smoke fire and smoke are responsible for the largest percentage of crash fatalities the smoke in an airplane fire can be very thick and highly toxic so cover your nose and mouth with a cloth to avoid breathing it in if possible moisten the cloth to provide extra protection 8 x research source stay low as you escape to duck under the level of smoke it might not seem like a big deal but passing out due to smoke inhalation is one of the most dangerous things that can happen during this critical period get out of the airplane as quickly as possible according to the national transportation safety board ntsb 68 percent of plane crash deaths are due to post crash fire not injuries sustained in the crash itself 9 x research source it s critical to get out of the aircraft without delay if fire or smoke is present you will generally have less than two minutes to safely exit the plane make sure the exit you choose is safe look through the window to determine if there is fire or some other hazard outside of an exit if there is try the exit across the plane or proceed to another set of exits listen to the flight attendants post crash instructions flight attendants undergo rigorous training to make sure they know what to do in the event of a crash if a flight attendant is able to instruct or assist you listen closely and cooperate to increase everyone s chances of survival ditch your stuff don t try to rescue your belongings it s common sense but still some people don t seem to get it leave everything behind rescuing your belongings will only slow you down 10 x research source if you end up needing to salvage supplies from the plane crash site worry about that later right now you need to make sure that you get clear of the wreckage and find some safe cover get out now get at least 500 feet 152 4 m upwind from the wreckage if you re stranded in a remote area the best thing to do usually is to stay close to the aircraft to await rescuers you don t want to be too close though fire or explosion can happen at any time after a crash so put some distance between you and the plane if the crash is in open water swim as far away from the plane wreckage as possible 11 x research source stay in one place but pay attention to what needs to happen while it s essential to stay calm after a crash you also need to recognize when you need to act and do so swiftly help out people who are struggling and tend to people s wounds using basic first aid available attend to your own wounds if at all possible check yourself for cuts and other abrasions and apply pressure if necessary stay in one place to reduce the chance of exacerbating internal injuries negative panic is a strange inability to react assertively and appropriately to the situation for example a person may just remain in his or her seat instead of heading toward the exit watch out for this in your fellow passengers or traveling companions 12 x research source call emergency services and wait for rescue you stand a much higher chance of

how to use a graphic flight computer to find ground speed and true heading,an e 6b manual flight computer is waterproof shock resistant and doesn t require batteries making it an ideal tool for pilots while flying this nifty contraption has both a computer and wind side the computer side is a circular slide rule that can perform multiplication and division problems to find time speed distance fuel consumption true airspeed and density altitude the wind side uses a rotating disc called the azimuth plate marked with 360 degree compass headings and a sliding grid with speed and angle markings to find wind correction angle ground speed true heading and most favorable winds this article tells how to use the wind side to find ground speed and true heading you must know the wind speed direction true course and true airspeed,align the wind direction under the true index mark by rotating the azimuth plate if the winds are from 330 at 20 knots align 330 under the true index align the grid so the center grommet is over one of the heavy lines it doesn t matter which line is used at this point mark the wind speed by counting up from the center grommet each light line represents two knots mark a dot or an x in pencil on the 20 knot line two heavy lines above the center grommet this is the wind dot rotate the azimuth plate until your desired course true course is aligned under the true index mark use 175 for this example slide the grid until the wind dot is over your true airspeed in this example the true airspeed is 120 knots read ground speed under the grommet ground speed is the speed of the aircraft over the ground and in this example is 138 knots find the wind correction angle wca by checking the number of degrees to the right or left between the center grommet and the wind dot if the wind dot is to the right the wca is positive if it is to the left the wca is negative in the example the wind correction angle is 4 add or subtract the wind correction angle from the true course to find true heading adding 4 to 175 equals 179 for the true heading add or subtract magnetic variation and compass deviation to find the compass heading to be flown the variation is the difference between true north and magnetic north and can be found on a vfr or ifr chart easterly variations are subtracted and westerly variations are added compass deviation is printed on a placard under the magnetic compass in the airplane,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to prepare to fly an airplane in an emergency,in the event that the pilot has a medical emergency the following steps should provide enough information to help you get the aircraft safely to the nearest airport these steps provide a realistic and achievable guide provided you keep two things in mind it will not be easy so preparation ahead of time is essential you will have to concentrate 100 on flying the plane and leave the pilot s medical condition alone job 1 is getting the plane on the ground safely newer aircraft have a very elaborate glass panel instrument system but that will not be covered in detail by this article if needed you will be able to understand the more complex glass panel instruments and controls by becoming intimately familiar with the basic six instruments in a cessna 172 one of the most common aircraft,study a cessna 172 aircraft instrument panel it is a standard aircraft panel with six round basic flight instruments sometimes called the six pack these are the ones in the center directly in front of the pilot s seat note too that some aircraft will also have a set of instruments and controls in the co pilot position familiarize yourself with the six pack the six instruments will be located in the following order top left the airspeed indicator shows aircraft airspeed usually in knots a knot is one nautical mile per hour about 1 15 mph or 1 85km hr top center the artificial horizon shows the aircraft attitude that is how the plane is inclined in all directions whether the plane is climbing or descending and how it is banking left or right top right the altimeter shows the height altitude of the aircraft in feet msl feet above mean or average sea level lower left the turn and bank indicator is a dual instrument which tells how fast you are changing the compass heading rate of turn and also whether you are in co ordinated flight feeling the proper down in the seat gs from the turn this is also called the turn and slip indicator or needle ball lower center is the heading indicator which shows the current compass heading keep in mind that small amounts of friction in the heading gyro dictate that this instrument be calibrated on an ongoing basis this is explained below in the calibration procedure lower right is the vertical speed indicator which tells how fast you are going higher or lower it gives the rate of descent or climb in feet per minute zero means that you are maintaining altitude and are neither climbing nor descending test your knowledge of the six pack using the 172 panel photograph above can you tell by reading the six pack panel instruments what the aircraft s current situation is your answer should have been the aircraft is in a slightly climbing left turn cruising at a speed of 110 knots about 3 100 feet 944 9 m above sea level on a heading of 178 almost due south study the the aircraft controls the necessary controls for this mission will be as follows throttle a black knob when pushed forward the engine is at full throttle and when pulled full back the engine is idling fuel mixture a red knob pushed full inward is the richest mixture used for sea level takeoffs and landings while full back is engine off only pull the red knob full out when you are on the ground and ready to shut down the engine carburetor heat used to warm the engine air intake in icing conditions and on long descents with engine at idle conditions where a cold engine with cold air could cause icing note that for all practical purposes this has to be either full on or full off flaps a flat handled switch to select the wing flap positions this will be used for slowing the aircraft to a safe speed in preparation for landing the aircraft note that the flaps should be advanced notch by notch one position 10 at a time fuel tank select a cessna 172 would almost always be set on both tanks steering wheel yoke this sets the attitude climb and turn and the speed of the aircraft use small pitch adjustments in and out for pitch to climb or descend turn the yoke left and right to bank the aircraft engine rpm is used for setting engine speed power for climbing descending and or landing rudder pedals these are operated by your feet press the top edge of the pedals and the brakes are applied of course this only has an effect when you are on the ground pressing the lower part of the pedals allows steering while on the runway and helps do quality turns in the air you will also use the lower part of the rudder pedals to stay lined up with the runway while on final approach control trim there are two trim wheels in the panel which when adjusted properly give you almost hands off control you will not be using these in an emergency be aware too if you do try to use them to trim for landing you may not have enough pitch control to gain altitude quickly in case of a go around you would have to re trim in case of a go around but it is way better to just stay away from these controls and consider them off limits become familiar with the navigation and communication equipment the radio or nav com equipment is used to navigate the plane and importantly to talk to the tower or atc air traffic control in an emergency call them as soon as you get the aircraft under control get someone to show you how to set or change radio frequency in order to communicate with atc the airport tower changing frequency may not be necessary but you should know how to do this and should take the time to practice before you are in an emergency situation so that you will not get hung up on this when an emergency does arise communication is a critical aspect of surviving an emergency situation there is little chance that you will be able to land safely without the tower and their guidance ask your pilot for the emergency frequency commit the emergency frequency to memory just in case you may need it practice changing frequencies work until this becomes second nature and you can switch and tune frequencies easily and naturally know when not to change frequencies if you are already talking to atc then stay on that frequency as long as you can atc will tell you when to change frequencies do not go to emergency frequency just tell atc that you are declaring an emergency they will help you get home safely do whatever they ask of you and be sure to get confirmation about anything you are not sure of before you take action learn in an actual aircraft it is best if you reinforce what you learned about the six pack and the basic controls in an actual plane preferably in a cessna 172 solidify your understanding of the instrument panel and controls while in the aircraft using a printout of the above steps see if you can point to and touch every instrument and control listed at the same time say aloud what each is used for quiz yourself on each of the instruments not only should you immediately be able to name each instrument at a glance but also describe the information you get from each instrument look at the gauges and see if you can determine the normal operating ranges then ask yourself what basic actions you would have to perform to correct for certain conditions for example if you were slightly descending and wanted to get back to level flight what would you have to do take a few moments to deeply think about the scenarios you imagine and visualize the correct action you might take this will prime your mind to absorb further lessons it is highly recommended that you spend enough time doing this to feel like you have it mastered up to this point you should at a minimum have a good feel for what information each instrument gives and how it relates to the plane position and near term flight path target and master each of the instruments and controls the airspeed indicator top left has arcs colored in green yellow white and red normal airspeed will of course be in the green and the lower edge of green indicates the flap up stall speed try your best to keep the instrument in the green arc while cruising use the yoke to adjust nose up and nose down pitch to set the airspeed do not use the throttle to adjust airspeed the red line is the never exceed speed line stay out of there the white range is safe flap lowering speed and the lower end of white is the stall speed for full flaps down only used when on final approach for landing the artificial horizon has a miniature aircraft in the center in straight and level flight it should stay there if it starts to drift use the yoke to re center and or level the small airplane on the horizon line the altimeter may start to wind or unwind if you seek to maintain level flight use the yoke to stabilize your altitude you can see that you will have to scan these six instruments to maintain control of the aircraft that s why the six are right together in front of the pilot scan them often the needle ball should stay centered when you are in level flight and turning the aircraft when turning the needle ball graphically shows you the quality of the turn you re making strive to keep your turns very shallow less than 10 this will keep you out of trouble which is what you are after whenever you fly a plane particularly for the first time and particularly in an emergency the heading indicator should be on the heading you are trying to fly if not use the yoke to make one or a series of very shallow turn s to stay on course don t chase the heading too much just make very small corrections and patiently wait for the reading to settle that will feed back on how you re doing and you can correct a bit again if needed the vertical speed also should be centered at zero in level flight if not make small pitch corrections with the yoke don t chase the rate of change of ascent or descent make one small correction same as above and continue scanning the instruments develop the mindset and habit of making only the smallest of corrections when you incorporate all of the six pack in your scan routine the scanning will get a little harder to do the small corrections procedure is the same for all changes you will perform to control the aircraft get this thoroughly in your noggin and ingrain it in your being learn how to calibrate the heading indicator it is critical to calibrate this instrument on an ongoing basis usually 3 5 times an hour if the heading indicator is off only a couple of degrees you will not arrive at the airport where you intend to land therefore it is critical to take hands on instruction in the calibration of this instrument it is normally adjusted to agree with the magnetic compass before takeoff and re adjusted periodically in flight to correct for gyro precession errors set the heading indicator only in stabilized straight and level flight learn the phases of normal flight straight and level flight climb descent work hard to understand straight level flight in this phase you use the yoke to maintain level by keeping the small airplane level and centered on the artificial horizon line during daylight hours this can be done just by looking out the windshield at the real horizon alternatively you can scan the six pack and use the feedback to maintain level in either case always make sure to look outside and to scan the six pack when possible do not rely on one or the other when both are available ensure that the rpm gauge is indicating a cruise setting of between 2100 and 2700 rpm when you are in straight and level cruise flight you can adjust the rpm using the throttle understand the mechanics of the climbing phase climbing is normally done under full throttle but if only a gradual climb is necessary you can pull back on the yoke to raise the aircraft nose about five and no more than ten degrees above the horizon while advancing the throttle slightly remember to also continually scan the six pack at all times and make very sure that nothing else is changing scanning the six pack will let you know if you start into a turn start to bank the aircraft or the airspeed starts to drop if an unwanted bank starts gently turn the yoke the other direction and if the airspeed diminishes level off for a bit and advance the throttle a little more next time you try to climb the cessna 172 can stall in a turn at approximately 65 knots no flaps so keep your turns shallow and avoid any speed below 80 knots to allow yourself a margin of safety remember to boost the speed by lowering the nose slightly and or adding a little throttle when necessary again use gentle corrections and stay well out of the danger zones that are indicated on the instruments get a good feel for what transpires during descent phase there are two scenarios one for landing at an airport that is near your current position and one for landing at one that is farther away a descent to land at a nearby airport is done by reducing the throttle to an engine speed of about 1800 to 1500 rpm while setting the air fuel mixture at full richness red knob fully inward if the descent will cause you to be a long time at low engine power then you may have to use carburetor heat to prevent icing at reduced rpms the engine will not be producing as much heat and you may have to kick on the carburetor heat do so only if the weather indicates possible icing conditions here the tower can give you guidance so ask if you aren t sure if you re descending for a landing at an airport further away reduce throttle to 2000 rpm to descend while maintaining a higher airspeed however don t get going too fast watch the airspeed indicator and avoid going very far into the yellow arc become intimately familiar with the landing phase this will be the most critical part of your maiden flight again there are two main ways to approach landing at any airport the standard traffic pattern 45 angle to the runway and the straight in lined up with the runway emergency approach we will assume that you have clearance for the emergency approach after all that is what this is an emergency practice in a high quality simulator or under the direction of a qualified flight instructor the landing phase is the hardest to do successfully ideally several landings should be practiced in a simulator or in an actual aircraft if at all possible practicing landings ahead of time is highly recommended know the appropriate conditions for a straight in approach the straight in approach is preferred in an emergency so maintain a higher altitude until you have the airport runway in sight then you can start your descent keeping the runway in sight be sure to ask for the airport with the longest runway and preferably for an airport where atc uses radar plan to be about four miles from the chosen runway at an altitude of 1 000 feet 304 8 m agl above ground level hopefully you will be in contact with tower by then and they can advise you with the aid of their radar if not then you have to make the approach yourself descend toward the 1 000 feet 304 8 m level above the runway and slow the aircraft set the throttle to 1500 rpm with a vertical descent rate of 500 feet 152 4 m per minute and an airspeed of 80 knots lower the flaps a notch at this point remember to move the flaps only one notch at a time plan on full flaps down by the time you are five miles out if your altitude is at least 1 000 ft set the throttle to idle at this point with the mixture at full richness red knob in use carburetor heat only if weather indicates possible icing conditions each time you lower the flaps a notch 10 push forward on the yoke a little to counteract the tendency of the flaps to raise the nose add more pitch down to keep your speed at 75 knots if necessary you can slowly reduce your speed to 65 or 70 knots now stabilize the plane in line with the runway at four miles out the airspeed should be 65 knots with full flaps and a descent rate of 500 feet 152 4 m per minute check to ensure the throttle is still at idle use the rudder pedals to stay in line with the runway not the yoke use the yoke only for pitch control nose up and down at this point unless there is a crosswind then you may have to use the yoke to bank slightly into the wind use only the rudder pedals to continually line up with the runway and stay on course hold that attitude and airspeed keep everything the same all the way to about three to four feet above the runway then start slowly raising the nose as the aircraft settles to the runway called the flare continue to hold the nose wheel off the runway after the main gear touch down apply brakes as soon as the nose wheel touches the runway if you re coming in a bit hot going a little too fast you can also raise the flaps to get better braking remember that the lower part of the rudder pedals help you to steer while you are on the ground while the upper parts do the braking pilots say any landing you can walk away from is a good landing nice job know how to perform an emergency go around if need be the go around is a very dangerous maneuver even for experienced pilots and is not recommended for a beginner however if at any time in your approach or landing you see or anticipate major problems where things are not lining up as planned a go around is required apply full power smoothly and increase the pitch nose up to climb make sure the carburetor heat is off and the fuel mixture is full rich do all this simultaneously while raising the flaps slowly a notch at a time re trim pitch for a climb this action helps reduce the yoke pressure hopefully you noticed the advice about considering the trim wheels off limits and heeded that advice so this step will not be needed it is only included here as a part of a complete checklist for the go round maneuver climb out at 80 knots once your airspeed reaches 80 knots do not raise the nose any further and if the airspeed drops below 80 knots lower the nose a bit to prevent a stall level off at 1 000 feet 304 8 m above ground level agl make a wide arc gently turn the aircraft in a wide circle until you are lined up on the runway still at 1 000 feet 304 8 m agl attempt the landing all over again be alert to the danger the mechanics of the human inner ear allows you to detect a change in motion or a change in velocity in any direction realize that your body senses only changes and also be aware that your mind has been trusting what the inner ear says each day of your life for a long long time this is a hard thing to break away from but it is absolutely critical to be able to ignore what your body is telling you because it may be wrong instead when you do not have supplementary visual input rely solely on the instruments switch to total reliance on the instruments once you lose your ability to see clearly once you lose the ability to determine your plane s spatial orientation by using visible cues either the horizon a beacon or a landmark you must compel yourself to rely solely on the instruments and force yourself to discard what your body is telling you understand the nature of the danger the tendency of untrained pilots is to fly by the seat of the pants and to enter the death spiral a series of actions which inevitably leads to a crash if you enter a banking turn and stay there in co ordinated flight for twenty seconds or so your body gets acclimated to the turn and thinks you are flying straight and level when you are still in a banking turn in the dark or when visibility is limited you have no visual cues to correct the impression your body has picked up the death spiral starts when you notice you are losing altitude common in banking turns and pull up on the yoke to gain altitude the problem comes from being in a banking turn pulling back on the yoke results in tightening the turn and a further loss of altitude not in gaining altitude the natural tendency is then to pull back even more on the yoke and that makes things even worse moral of the story trust the artificial horizon refer to the little plane s exact attitude within the artificial horizon before you attempt any altitude correction make sure you are in straight level flight before you make an altitude correction this will be apparent on the artificial horizon provided the heading indicator is relatively constant be highly aware that any loss of altitude might be the result of entering a banking turn without realizing it this will be evident on the artificial horizon and on your heading indicator if your heading is changing you are turning rely only on the instruments if you have little or no visibility resist the urge to fly by the seat of your pants trust your instruments try to engage the autopilot in instrument meteorological conditions imc this is your best chance for a safe

how to fly a hot air balloon,hot air balloon enthusiasts can be found worldwide and may offer rides for a price or a volunteer position on their ground crew if you ve already got a taste and want to be the person pulling the strings and lighting the fire you ll need training and certification before you can fly solo learning how a balloon operates will give you a head start and can help you decide whether this hobby is for you,understand why a balloon rises hot air balloons are based on a simple concept as you heat air or any other gas it becomes less dense just like a bubble rising in an aquarium the hot air will float above the denser colder air around it 1 x research source get the air in the balloon hot enough and it can lift the balloon canvas the basket and everyone inside it as well air gets progressively thinner less dense as you travel upward because there is less pressure from the weight of the air above it 2 x research source because of this a hot air balloon only rises until it reaches the point where the density of the balloon plus the air inside it is equal to the density of the air around it know the basic structure the structure is so simple that you may already understand it but learn the terminology so you and your crew can communicate to each other the fabric balloon itself is called an envelope made from sewn panels called gores in most balloons there s a hole at the top of the envelope tightly covered by a flap of fabric this is called a parachute valve 3 x research source it is attached to a rip line that runs all the way down to the basket the bottom end of the envelope or mouth is located above a burner which produces flame fueled by the propane tanks underneath the propane tanks passengers and cargo all stand in a basket attached beneath the envelope wear protective clothing the pilot should wear safety goggles since they will be close to the flame pilot and crew should wear heavy duty gloves long sleeves and long pants and avoid nylon polyester or other materials that melt when exposed to flame everyone in the basket should keep in mind that the balloon may land in mud or rough terrain and wear comfortable clothes and shoes let out more propane to rise all it takes to add propane to the fire is opening a simple blast valve on the line attached to the propane tanks typically located just beneath the burner 4 x research source the wider you hold the valve open the more heat rushes into the balloon and the faster it rises dropping ballast or any heavy object over the side of the balloon will reduce the overall density of the balloon and cause you to rise for obvious reasons this method is not recommended above populated areas learn how to stay at a stable height like any object hotter than the surrounding environment the hot air balloon cools down over time which causes it to sink gradually in order to stay at the same height you ll need to use one or both of these techniques the propane tank themselves have a metering valve or cruise that controls how much propane feeds the burner gradually opening this as you fly is an easy way to stay at roughly the same altitude a short burst of additional propane from the blast valve will lift the balloon up when you notice it dipping too low open the parachute valve to lower the balloon remember the parachute valve is the flap of fabric on the top of the balloon envelope this flap automatically seals itself when left alone but you can pull a red cord called a rip line to lift the flap this lets hot air escape from the top keep the cord pulled until the balloon is lowering at the desired rate then let go to close the flap again the parachute valve is also called a deflation port and the rip line a deflation port line raise or lower to control direction balloons have no direct way to control the direction they travel however there are typically several layers of wind stacked on top of each other blowing in different directions raise or lower the balloon to catch a different cross stream and your balloon will change direction pilots often need to improvise the route as they go along to some extent and it takes experience and planning to catch the right wind at the right time many balloons have cords that pull open side vents or flaps on the side of the envelope but these just rotate the basket almost all hot air balloon flights are shadowed by a car or truck on the ground picking up the balloon and its passengers once it lands take a training course before you fly as the main pilot the instructions below can help you understand the duties and skills required of a balloon pilot but they cannot substitute for real experience a full balloon pilot s license and training can cost thousands of dollars but you can start by volunteering to be part of a ground crew once you have on the ground training you ll only need about 10 to 15 hours of total flight training to pass the certification test although this varies by country 5 x research source check wind conditions knowing when to cancel a flight is extremely important flying in strong winds is dangerous and should not be attempted beginners should stick to the first few hours after sunrise and the first few hours before sunset when wind is usually predictable and low speed 6 x research source check for vital equipment at the least the basket should contain a fire extinguisher a first aid kit a topographic map an aviation map an altimeter and a log book to record the details of your flight check the propane tank s fuel gauge so you can be sure there s enough fuel for the flight typically about 30 gallons 114 liters per hour 7 x research source for longer flights you ll also need radio equipment and possibly electronic navigation equipment as well inflate the balloon for lift off almost all balloons require several people to get off the ground first the burner is attached to the basket frame and laid down sideways with the envelope attached and unfolded along the ground the envelope mouth is lifted open and inflated using a powerful fan for about ten minutes then heated using the burner the basket is typically held down by crew members and or tied to the ground car until the balloon is ready for lift off the basket is righted the passengers and pilot get in and the pilot releases a steady flame from the burner to lift off the ground stay alert during liftoff as the pilot you should stay alert and watch the inflating envelope and the ground crew s hold on the lines until everything is steady and proceeding as planned briefly but methodically check in all directions for all trees or other obstacles the balloon might hit on its way up once you feel the first breeze as lift off begins immediately fix your eyes at the obstacle closest to your flight path and do not look away until the balloon is safely above it 8 x research source this makes it easier to notice a deviation in direction and to react to it by rising faster know your weather phenomena prospective balloon pilots must pass a meteorology test to gain certification including a basic understanding of how temperature altitude and humidity interact and what different types of clouds can tell you about air conditions while these aren t all covered in this guide here are a couple examples of common phenomena a significant change in wind direction as you rise or fall is called wind shear and requires special focus as it can speed up or slow down your motion if strong wind shear blows out your burner s pilot light relight it and heat the balloon as soon as possible to avoid crashing if the balloon is responding more slowly to your actions or you notice air pollution trapped instead of rising you may be in an inversion where the surrounding air is hotter the higher you go compensate by increasing the amount of heat added or let off when you want to change altitude check for wind direction and speed learn how to read a weather map and use them to plan around the general wind speed and direction in different areas to test for local wind conditions below you spit or squirt shaving cream over the edge of the basket know how to navigate balloon pilots are trained to use a topographic map and altimeter to plot their course and altitude throughout the flight obtain an aviation map from your regional aviation administration and use it to stay out of the path of aircraft a gps unit magnetic compass and pair of binoculars are also useful but not always necessary for short flights unless required by law in your area avoid turbulence or thermals if you experience any turbulence or if charts clouds or other weather phenomena lead you to expect it land as soon as you can similarly if you feel any circular motion or unexpected ascent land immediately before the rising thermal of warm air sends the balloon out of control vent air rapidly once you land out of a thermal or it could tug the basket along the ground be prepared for emergencies practice relighting the pilot light so you can do so rapidly in mid flight during an emergency if the pilot light does not relight there may be a fuel clog this requires relighting the propane above the blast valve which should be taught under experienced supervision in the worst case scenario when the envelope fabric is torn burn as much propane as possible to minimize the speed of your descent 9 x research source land the balloon it can take a surprising amount of practice to develop the ability to tell the precise direction of travel in mid flight let alone select a landing site and successfully guide the balloon to that destination 10 x research source there are several approaches and techniques you ll need to learn to land in various conditions and an experienced teacher is vital begin by practicing in best conditions with a large landing space that you can glide across at a gentle downward slope vent the air slowly and keep your eye on the tallest nearby obstacle even if it s slightly to the side once you ve cleared the obstacle you can vent as needed but aim for a steady controlled glide 11 x research source as you touch ground and prepare for a bumpy ride vent the rest of the air off to deflate the envelope congratulations you now know the basics of flying a balloon,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to read an aviation routine weather report metar,aviators use metar reports to gain essential knowledge about flying conditions to a casual observer a report may look like a string of random and numbers but every report contains a lot of data these reports aren t tough to decode once you know what the look for after getting a report from an airport or weather center read the first few strings to figure out where the data came from the rest of the report will then contain information about visibility the weather and all sorts of other conditions if you need assistance look up a chart explaining common abbreviations to understand what kind of weather you will be facing when you re out on the runway,obtain a metar report from an airport aviation center these reports are often free and available even when you re not operating a plane check with your government s aviation office or national weather service online the aviation weather center in the u s for instance offers reports access reports at https www aviationweather gov metar 1 x research source to request a report from the weather center select a location you can also choose a time period if you wish to access a past report use the initial code letters to identify the type of report if you re looking at a metar report you will see it listed at the beginning there are other types of reports as well each type of report conveys different information distinguish between these types of reports to get weather details you need 2 x research source metar reports are routine hourly reports a new metar report is issued at the end of each hour speci indicates a special unscheduled report speci reports usually happen for special conditions like low visibility and thunderstorms taf means terminal aerodrome forecast tafs are similar to metars but less common and used to provide a forecast for a general area note the station identifier after the report type the id tag will look something like kaff k represents a location in the us the letters after it tell you which station the report came from every country and station has its own identifying code given out by the world meteorlogical organization 3 x research source kaff for instance represents the air force academy in colorado egll is the code for london heathrow e represents the uk while gll stands for heathrow airport rjaa represents tokyo narita airport read the next numbers to find the report s date and time look for a series of 6 numbers followed by a z such as 212355z the first pair of numbers stands for the day of the month the rest of the code represents the time in zulu also called universal or greenwich mean time note that the report doesn t include information about the month or year it was issued 4 x research source for example in 212355z 21 shows you that the report came on the 21st day of the month it happened at 2355z zulu which would be 1755 or 11 55 am in colorado springs look for a short phrase explaining how the report was modified in the example the modifier is indicated by cor if it is present the modifier information is always listed after the time and date you can tell it apart from the rest of the report by how short it is it also doesn t have any numbers in it unlike the codes before and after it 5 x research source auto means the report came from an automated station cor tells you that someone corrected the initial report a manual observer changed something the automated station got wrong you won t see a modifier for reports issued by a person if no one is on duty at the station then you may start seeing automated reports view the first 3 digits of the next code for the wind s direction the next code a combination of letters and numbers is all about the wind the wind s direction is listed according to true north true north means the direction of the earth s axis not the magnetic north you see when you look at a compass true north can be found using maps or a compass 6 x research source in the code vrb05kt vrb represents the wind s direction vrb means that the wind direction varies the first letters of the code could also be something like 120 picture a compass where 0 degrees is at the top and 180 degrees is at the bottom a 120 means the wind is blowing from the southeast use the remaining digits in the wind code for wind speed the wind direction is always followed by 2 or 3 numbers indicating the wind s speed the speed is listed in knots or kt you may also see some additional letters from time to time describing how hard the wind is blowing 7 x research source in the code vrb05kt the 05kt means that the wind is blowing at a speed of 5 knots you might see the letter g in the middle of the wind report for example g26kt stands for gusts of wind blowing at 26 knots the letter v tells you that a strong wind blowing at more than 6 knots varies in direction for example you might see 180v260 the wind is changing direction between 180 and 260 degrees check the short wind visibility code to determine air quality the wind visibility code consists of a short series of numbers usually accompanied by a unit of measurement in the u s wind visibility is often measured in statute miles for reports outside of the u s expect to see the visibility listed in meters 8 x research source a visibility of 15sm means you can see for about 15 miles 24 km the visibility can also be listed as a fraction if it looks like 1 1 2sm that means the visibility is 1 ½ miles a visibility in measured in meters may be listed as something like 1400 the unit of measurement won t be listed but you can tell it s in meters because mile measurements don t usually go higher than 30 read strings starting with r for runway visibility a string of letters and numbers like r36l 2400ft tells you everything you need to know about the runway runway information isn t in every report if you don t see it following the air visibility code then expect clear conditions on the ground the runway visibility will tell you how far you can see from the runway 9 x research source the first set of numbers indicates what runway the report covers r36 means runway 36 areas with parallel runways have a marker like l which means the left runway the second number explains the visibility distance in a code containing 2400ft the visibility is 2 400 ft 730 m view the present weather conditions if they are listed in the report the codes following the wind information explain any significant weather conditions in the area it can include precipitation weather intensity and other factors that affect navigation there are many different signs so consider looking up a chart to interpret the listing for instance try the chart at https www weather gov media wrh mesowest metar_decode_key pdf 10 x research source intensity descriptor precipitation obscuration other light mi shallow dz drizzle br mist po dust sand whirls moderate no qualifier bc patches ra rain fg fog sq squalls heavy dr low drifting sn snow fu smoke fc funnel cloud vc in the vicinity bl blowing sg snow grains du dust fc tornado or waterspout sh showers ic ice crystals sa sand ss sandstorm ts thunderstorm pl ice pellets hz haze ds duststorm fz freezing gr hail py spray pr partial gs small hail or snow pellets va volcanic ash up unknown precipitation for example you may see shra it stands for light rain showers a code of tsra means thunderstorms with heavy rain use the 3 letters starting the 6 digit codes to determine cloud coverage sky condition codes start with 3 letters and end with 3 numbers the letters tell you the amount of sky covered by clouds a metar report can have more than 1 code describing the different groups of clouds so be sure to read the entire report for instance the report may include few040 sct060 sct075 sct090 bkn220 11 x research source skc is the clear sky code for manually generated reports automated reports use clr for elevations under 12 000 ft 3 700 m few means there aren t many clouds to worry about the clouds cover ⅛ to 2 8 of the sky sct indicates for scattered clouds meaning ⅜ to 4 8 of the sky is covered bkn stands for broken in broken conditions ⅝ to ⅞ of the sky will be covered overcast days come with the code ovc the sky will be totally covered by clouds when you see this code read the following numbers to determine how high the clouds are the numbers measure the height of the base of the clouds this information is listed as hundreds of feet above the ground if the clouds seem to continue on indefinitely then you will see the letters vv to show vertical visibility you may also see letters attached at the end of the code describing special types of clouds 12 x research source for instance bkn220 tells you that the clouds are at 22 000 ft 6 700 m all you have to do is add a pair of 0s onto the end of the code to figure out the cloud height you may also see something like bkn220tcu the tcu stands for towering cumulonimbus cb means cumulonimbus clouds which are usually present during storms acc is altocumulus castellanus view the temperature and dew point marked by a combined number the temperature and dew point numbers are separated by a slash the first number tells you the temperature in degrees celsius the number after the slash lists the dew point in celcius for example you may see 15 moi on a report 13 x research source in 15 m01 the temperature is 15 c 59 f an m before the dew point means minus a dew point listed as m01 corresponds to 01 check the altimeter setting by the code starting with an a the a stands for altimeter so you can always recognize this code listed after the temperature the code describes the atmospheric pressure in the area it will either be listed as inches of mercury or hectopascals pilots use this information to ensure the plane s altimeter is displaying the correct altitude 14 x research source a2957 is an example of an altimeter setting it corresponds to 29 57 inches of mercury or 29 57 hg generally reports list the altimeter setting in hg reports outside the u s may occasionally use a code like q1030 or 1030 hectopascals check the remarks for any additional information added to the report the remarks section is for anything else the reporter thinks you need to know a metar report may have very few additional comments or it may have a bunch these comments can include information about when a thunderstorm began or ended the type of station making the report air pressure or any other notes there are many different remarks that could be added so be sure to look at a guide like https weather cod edu notes metar html for instance acsl means altocumulus standing lenticular clouds then dsnt tells you the clouds are distant beyond 10 miles away the code se s shows that they are southeast by south the code slp960 indicates the sea level pressure in tenths of millibars or hectopascals a code of shra dsnt n e se and dsnt nw indicates moderate rain showers in the distant north through east through southeast and the distant northwest general numbers like 60001 55000 usually represent automated maintenance data you don t need to bother with trying to decipher them last cor stands for last correction a number of 43 tells you the correction was made at 43 minutes past the hour,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to listen to your local air traffic control,air traffic control atc is responsible for providing crucial information to pilots around busy airports they communicate with pilots on designated radio frequencies to keep airport operations running smoothly and safely their communication is also accessible to the public whether you are a student pilot retired pilot or just want to know what s going on in the friendly skies you can listen to air traffic controllers at work any time,find live frequencies obtain a radio scanner that is capable of receiving frequencies between 118 0 and 136 975 mhz good brands to check out include uniden and whistler you can also find general coverage receivers from icom yaesu grundig kenwood and others that will pick up air frequencies you re better off selecting a good scanner instead of a general coverage unit thanks to the scanner s ability to easily monitor multiple frequencies realize that in radio electronics you get what you pay for a scanner from one of the aforementioned brands will outperform a no name brand that claims airline coverage most scanners pick up the entirety of the aircraft band you can also listen to air traffic control facilities from around the world at websites including liveatc net globalair com airnav com and radioreference com memorize some of the basic frequencies 121 5 is the emergency frequency if there is some sort of emergency pilots will transmit on it you could also hear an emergency locator beacon on this frequency if a plane crashes 122 750 mhz is the frequency for general aviation air to air communications 123 025 mhz is the frequency for helicopters air to air communications 123 450 mhz is the unofficial frequency for air to air communications search 122 0 123 65 for unicom uncontrolled airports and air to air communications search 128 825 132 000 mhz for arinc frequencies airlines corporate aviation and general aviation calling ahead for fuel parking and other requests find an aeronautical sectional chart you most likely want to be looking for a chart of your local area from the closest airport older versions of these charts will usually work just fine online sectional charts for your local area are available on www skyvector com find the closest airport on the chart airports are denoted by blue or magenta circles with lines inside representing runways next to the circle is a block of text with the airport name and information about that airport the control tower frequency is denoted by ct 000 0 where the following numbers indicate the frequency used by atc for example the frequency for wittman regional airport in oshkosh wi is ct 118 5 understanding the lingo if the airport is uncontrolled no tower or the tower operates part time a c in a circle after a frequency number will be used to denote a common traffic advisory frequency ctaf a star will be after the tower frequency to denote that airport as having a part time tower at this type of airport pilots communicate directly with one another and tell each other their position and intentions identifying the airports all controlled airports will be denoted by blue circles while uncontrolled airports are magenta airports with runways over 8 000 feet 2 438 4 m are not enclosed in circles and simply have a diagram depicting the runway layout which is outlined in blue controlled or magenta uncontrolled listen to weather forecasts and airport information as you prepare to land some airports have awos automated weather observing system asos automated surface observing system or atis automated terminal information service frequencies listed on the chart these are automated or repeating broadcasts that provide pilots with weather and airport information as they prepare to land or depart obtain a complete list of frequencies if you have access to an airport facility directory you can find more frequencies than those available on the chart at larger airports pilots receive their flight plan clearances from a clearance delivery frequency communicate on taxiways with a ground frequency and get takeoff and landing clearance from the tower frequency once pilots are airborne they will talk to an approach departure frequency and once in route they might even talk to a center frequency if you are lucky or live close enough to an airport you might be able to receive several of these frequencies understand that a pilot starts with the aircraft id number if a controller gives a pilot an instruction he or she will prefix it with the aircraft s identification number for commercial flights this will just be the flight number such as united 2311 a smaller aircraft is identified by the number on their tail listen for instructions from the control tower after the flight number the controller will give an instruction such as enter downwind this instructs the pilot to enter the traffic pattern at a specific location the pilot will then read back the instruction so the controller can verify that it was understood correctly be prepared to change your radio frequency sometimes controllers will hand off a pilot to another frequency an example would be a controller saying november 12345 contact approach on 124 32 good day once again the pilot will read back the instruction landing at an uncontrolled airports operations at uncontrolled airports are much less formal most of the time pilots will broadcast blind transmissions to anyone on the frequency announcing their position or intentions words like upwind crosswind downwind base and final denote specific positions in the traffic pattern learn the phonetic alphabet pilots and controllers use it to communicate letters since they can often be confused you might also hear someone use niner to communicate nine fife to communicate five or tree to communicate three,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to build an airplane,for some people building and flying your own plane is a satisfying personal experience constructing your own plane is legal in most countries and you don t need to know any skills to begin you can start by purchasing a kit online and getting involved with aviation organizations once you re done building register your plane with your government s aviation board then you can enjoy cruising the skies in a plane customized to your liking this article is for building full scale aircraft to build a model airplane check out some different wikihow articles,check your area regulations on building your own airplane in many countries building your own aircraft is legal you typically do not need to have a pilot s license until you are ready to fly the plane all you have to do is buy supplies and get to work 1 x research source in the u s for example the federal aviation administration regulates aircraft be aware of any building rules for instance the faa requires you to construct 51 of your plane yourself prove this by making a logbook containing photos and videos of your work 2 x research source find a place to build your plane many builders choose their garage basement or another home workspace keep in mind that you will need a lot of space to store an airplane and its parts it also helps to stay indoors where the temperature can be kept above 50 f 10 c since bad weather makes working tough when choosing a workspace consider how long the build will take you with consistent work the process can be as short as a few months but it takes most builders years some kit companies allow you to build inside their facility this can be a good option if you live nearby choose what you want your plane to be made from your plane can be made from wood and fabric aluminum or composite materials each material has different price points and advantages so research these before settling on a plane kit or design also consider your skills such as metalworking woodworking and sewing since this can make some material easier to use than others wood and fabric combination frames are light but weak early planes used wood and it is still a user friendly option for custom planes most planes today are made out of aluminum an inexpensive material that is more aerodynamic than wood composite materials are stronger and more aerodynamic than aluminum but also more expensive purchase a building kit online a basic building kit can cost you between 6 500 and 15 000 usd these kits provide all the plans and materials you need to build the external structure of your plane so they save you time you can find all sorts of different plane models by shopping with different kit manufacturers 3 x research source kits typically do not come with an engine propeller and flight control panel so you will have to buy these separately if you want to save money you can search online for airplane plans you can download available plans buy plans from kit companies or design your own to design your own plans use a program like airplane pdq to create the design then a flight simulator like x plane to test it assemble your plane s frame use the instructions in your kit or your plans to construct the plane concentrate on constructing 1 piece at a time usually you will start with the tail build towards the nose and attach the wings last work piece by piece until the frame is complete the skills and tools you need for this depend on your kit and the material you are working with you do not need to have technical expertise to begin you can learn or refine skills as you go through the building process a few skills that may come in handy are riveting and welding install the engine in the nose of the plane position the engine at the front of the plane behind where the flight control panel will be installed later the engine can be heavy so you may need some help lifting it mount it in place using a wrench and sockets 4 x research source you can order an engine from kit manufacturers and online auction sites you may also be able to repurpose engines from old cars and junkyards the engine can cost as much as your kit expect it to be ⅓ of your total costs at least 2 000 usd installing the engine can be tricky if you get stuck look for online guides and videos connect the propeller to the front of the engine push the propeller s shaft through the plane s nose connecting it with the engine keep the blades on the outside of the plane secure the propeller to the engine and plane by using a socket wrench to tighten bolts holding it in place 5 x research source if your kit does not come with a propeller you can purchase 1 online from kit pr aviation manufacturers if you are using a car engine get a propeller speed reduction unit and attach it to the engine first otherwise the propeller will spin too quickly for the plane to fly properly place the flight panel inside the plane the aviation panel should fit in front of the plane s nose you may need to do some electrical wiring to connect the panel to the engine the panel itself can be set in place with rivets the panel has instruments such as temperature gauges and a radio so make sure they work before you move on 6 x research source order a flight panel online from an aviation company or an auction site expect to pay about 1 000 usd some modern avionics panels come with a control module you plug the panel components into the module for easier installation furnish the interior of your plane your interior design depends on your plane a lot of planes don t have much space in the interior but you will at least need a comfortable seat if it wasn t included in your kit you can order 1 online or make your own most home built planes are designed for 1 or 2 people you may not be allowed to carry more than 4 people at a time some helpful skills for this can include riveting and sewing paint your plane the color you want search online to order specially designed aircraft paints in the color you want planning out a color scheme can help lay down a drop cloth and use painter s tape to protect areas you don t want to color apply the paint using a spray gun and use a brush to reach smaller areas apply a primer first so the paint sticks to the aircraft better after the paint dries spray on a finishing material such as acetone to protect your craft be sure to work in a ventilated area wear a respirator and eye goggles get a pilot s license in your free time a pilot s license is necessary before you can take flight while you can wait until you finish your build to do this you can begin the process before you even start on your plane take a flight class from a certified school in your area then apply with the faa or your government s aerial authority 7 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source you won t be able to use your plane for this since it has to pass inspections first you will use an instructional plane at the school the certification board gives you a medical exam similar to going to a doctor for a check up they may also have you take a written test on flight rules use your pilot s license to test out many different types of aircraft this can help you figure out what kind of plane you want to build bring your plane to an airport you will need to transport your plane to an airport before you can fly it if you can detach parts like the wings and reassemble the plane in an airport hangar transport the plane by renting a truck or flatbed make sure all the parts are strapped down securely 8 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source contact airports in your region the employees can direct you on where to bring your plane for registration find a place to store your plane many planes are stored at hangars near the airport you will have to pay a fee which may be around 700 to 800 annually for a small plane however your plane will be safe in the hangar and always accessible 9 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source contact your local airport for information on renting hangar space if you have a lot of property space or storage space like a large barn you may keep the plane there complete your aircraft registration paperwork your government s transportation safety board such as the federal aviation administration in the u s handles aircraft registration complete the paperwork to register your aircraft as amateur built they will likely give you an identification number for your plane 10 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source registration can take 1 to 2 months to complete so be prepared for this while you wait consider practicing by flying other airplanes contact the eaa or other flying organizations for help with the paperwork complete the final plane inspection at the airport a government agent at the airport will give your plane a thorough inspection to make sure it is safe they check that your plane is built properly with quality materials if your plane passes you receive a document of official certification in 1 to 2 months 11 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source if your government requires you to keep a logbook detailing the building process bring it in during the inspection have your first test flight schedule the test with the government agency that certified your plane the eaa and other flight organizations can help you with this to pass the test you have to fly your plane for up to 40 hours total you can do this within a couple of sessions 12 x research source once you pass the test you can fly your plane according to the rules of the sky you can fly cross country and invite other people aboard have an inspector verify your work the eaa for example provides free inspections while you build your plane it s a good idea to have them come out several times during the building process these inspections are meant to identify any issues with your work and building material that can prevent your plane from passing an official inspection eaa inspectors are fellow builders volunteering their time the inspections are free find inspectors in your area at https www eaa org techcounselors attend amateur aircraft groups and events visit events hosted by groups such as the experimental aircraft association eaa the eaa hosts events such as the air venture in oshkosh wisconsin these are places to network with kit manufacturers and fellow builders learn valuable craft skills while you re there 13 x research source organizations often hold workshops on building techniques giving you a chance to experiment with wood and metal you might use on your plane visit these events and view organization websites online to gather more information for example go to https www eaa org en eaa take a ride in plane types you are interested in building joining a local chapter of an aviation organization and going to events can get you in touch with other flyers you may be able to take to the skies as a passenger in a variety of plane types experimenting this way can help you learn more about building planes and how you want yours to be built 14 x research source try to ride in various plane types such as wood aluminum and composite frames only licensed pilots with registered aircraft can take you on a flight connect with other builders to get more help many aircraft owners enjoy the building process as much as they do flying network with them when you attend events also search for building forums online you can learn a lot about building and even find people willing to help you construct your plane 15 x research source for example try wings forum

how to survive a plane crash,the chances of dying on a commercial airline flight are actually as low as 9 million to 1 that said a lot can go wrong at 33 000 feet 10 058 4 m above the ground and if you re unlucky enough to be aboard when something does the decisions you make could mean the difference between life and death almost 95 of airplane crashes have survivors so even if the worst does happen your odds aren t as bad as you might think you can learn to prepare for each flight safety stay calm during the crash itself and survive the aftermath,dress comfortably you ll need to be able to stay warm if you survive a crash even if that is not a consideration the more of your body is covered during impact the less likely you are to receive serious injuries or burns wear long pants a long sleeve t shirt and sturdy comfortable lace up shoes 1 x research source loose or elaborate clothing poses a risk as it can get snagged on obstacles in the close confines of a plane if you know you re going to be flying over cold areas dress appropriately and consider keeping a jacket on your lap cotton or wool clothing is also preferable as it is less flammable wool is preferable to cotton when flying over water as wool does not lose its insulating properties to the degree cotton does when wet wear sensible shoes although you may want to be comfortable or professional looking on a flight sandals or high heels make it hard to move quickly should there be an emergency high heels are not allowed on the evacuation slides and you can cut your feet and toes on glass or get flammable liquids on or in your sandals if you wear them 2 x research source sit in the tail of the aircraft passengers in the tail of the aircraft have 40 higher survival rates than those in the first few rows in the event of a crash because a quick escape gives you the best chance for survival it s best to get seats as close as possible to an exit on the aisle and in the back of the plane 3 x research source yes it s actually statistically safer to fly economy than first class save money and stay safer read the safety card and listen to the pre flight safety speech yes you may have heard it all before and you ll probably never need it but if you keep your headphones on during the pre flight instructions or ignore the safety card you ll be missing out on information that could be vital in the event of a crash don t assume you know it all already either every type of airplane has different safety instructions 4 x research source if you re sitting in an exit row study the door and make sure you know how to open it if you need to in normal circumstances the flight attendant will open the door but if they are dead or injured you ll need to do it count the number of seats between your seat and the exit row find the exit closest to you and count the number of seats that it ll take to get to it if the plane crashes it could be smoky loud or confusing in the cabin afterward if you need to escape you might have to feel your way to the exit which will be a lot easier if you know where it is and how far you might even write down the number in pen on your hand so you ll have a quick reference if you need to keep your seat belt on at all times every centimeter of slack in your seat belt triples the g force you ll experience in the crash so keep your seat belt properly tightened at all times you re on the aircraft push the belt down as low over your pelvis as possible you should be able to feel the upper ridge of the pelvis above the upper edge of the belt which helps to brace you in an emergency much better than your soft stomach leave your belt on even if you re sleeping if something happens while you re out you ll be glad to have the restraints in place assess the situation try to determine what surface the plane will land on so you can customize your preparations if you re going to be landing in water for example you ll want to put your life vest on though you need to wait to inflate it until you re out of the plane if you re going to be landing in cold weather you should try to get a blanket or jacket to keep you warm once outside plot out the general course you ll be on ahead of time so you ll have some idea of where you are when the plane crashes if you re flying from iowa to california you can be fairly certain you won t be landing in the ocean use the time before the crash to find your exit if the plane is going to crash you almost always have several minutes to prepare before impact use this time to once again review where the exits are prepare your space as much as possible if you know you re going to crash return your seat back to its full upright position and stow away any loose items that could become hazardous if at all possible zip up your jacket and make sure your shoes are tied tightly to your feet then assume one of two standard brace positions used for surviving a plane crash and try to remain calm 5 x research source in either position your feet should be flat on the floor and further back than your knees to reduce injuries to your feet and legs which you will need in order to successfully exit the craft after impact place your legs as far under the seat as possible to avoid breaking your shin bones brace yourself against the seat in front of you if the seat in front of you is close enough to reach place one hand palm down on the back of that seat then cross the other hand palm down over the first hand rest your forehead against your hands keep your fingers unlaced it s also sometimes recommended that you put your head directly against the seat in front of you and lace your fingers behind your head tucking your upper arms against the sides of your head to cradle it bend forward if there s no seat in front of you if you don t have a seat close in front of you bend forward and put your chest on your thighs and your head between your knees cross your wrists in front of your lower calves and grab your ankles try and remain calm it can be easy to get swept up in the pandemonium immediately preceding and following a crash keep a cool head though and you re more likely to get out alive remember that even in the worst wrecks you do have a chance of survival you ll need to be able to think methodically and rationally to maximize that chance put on your life jacket but do not inflate it in the case of a crash in water if you inflate it in the plane when it starts to fill up with water the life jacket will force you upwards against the cabin roof and it will be very hard to swim back down leaving you trapped instead hold your breath and swim out once you re out inflate it 6 x research source put your oxygen mask on before assisting others you ve probably heard this on every commercial flight you ve been on but it s worth repeating if the integrity of the cabin is compromised you have only about 15 seconds or less to start breathing through your oxygen mask before you are rendered unconscious 7 x research source while you may feel an impulse to first help your children or the elderly passenger sitting next to you you ll be no good to anyone if you don t remain conscious also remember that you can put somebody else s oxygen mask on even if they re unconscious this might help save their life protect yourself from smoke fire and smoke are responsible for the largest percentage of crash fatalities the smoke in an airplane fire can be very thick and highly toxic so cover your nose and mouth with a cloth to avoid breathing it in if possible moisten the cloth to provide extra protection 8 x research source stay low as you escape to duck under the level of smoke it might not seem like a big deal but passing out due to smoke inhalation is one of the most dangerous things that can happen during this critical period get out of the airplane as quickly as possible according to the national transportation safety board ntsb 68 percent of plane crash deaths are due to post crash fire not injuries sustained in the crash itself 9 x research source it s critical to get out of the aircraft without delay if fire or smoke is present you will generally have less than two minutes to safely exit the plane make sure the exit you choose is safe look through the window to determine if there is fire or some other hazard outside of an exit if there is try the exit across the plane or proceed to another set of exits listen to the flight attendants post crash instructions flight attendants undergo rigorous training to make sure they know what to do in the event of a crash if a flight attendant is able to instruct or assist you listen closely and cooperate to increase everyone s chances of survival ditch your stuff don t try to rescue your belongings it s common sense but still some people don t seem to get it leave everything behind rescuing your belongings will only slow you down 10 x research source if you end up needing to salvage supplies from the plane crash site worry about that later right now you need to make sure that you get clear of the wreckage and find some safe cover get out now get at least 500 feet 152 4 m upwind from the wreckage if you re stranded in a remote area the best thing to do usually is to stay close to the aircraft to await rescuers you don t want to be too close though fire or explosion can happen at any time after a crash so put some distance between you and the plane if the crash is in open water swim as far away from the plane wreckage as possible 11 x research source stay in one place but pay attention to what needs to happen while it s essential to stay calm after a crash you also need to recognize when you need to act and do so swiftly help out people who are struggling and tend to people s wounds using basic first aid available attend to your own wounds if at all possible check yourself for cuts and other abrasions and apply pressure if necessary stay in one place to reduce the chance of exacerbating internal injuries negative panic is a strange inability to react assertively and appropriately to the situation for example a person may just remain in his or her seat instead of heading toward the exit watch out for this in your fellow passengers or traveling companions 12 x research source call emergency services and wait for rescue you stand a much higher chance of

how to calculate aircraft payload,aircraft are used for recreation news and traffic reporting fire fighting construction rescue operations medical emergencies and military applications aircraft also are used to move people and cargo from place to place aircraft suffer a performance penalty for every pound of weight that they lift much of this weight to be lifted is an unavoidable part of making flight possible these unavoidable weights include the airframe the engines a large quantity of fuel and the aircraft crew any weight over and above these unavoidable weights can be used to transport customers and ship goods for customers these extra weights represent the load on the aircraft that a customer is paying for from which the term payload originated the more payload that can be lifted and the farther it can be carried the more the company operating the aircraft can charge customers only so much payload can be lifted and the payload weight detracts from the operating range of the aircraft use these tips to learn how to calculate aircraft payload,get the manufacturer s data for the aircraft this data will list the following important parameters of the aircraft check the standard weight empty of the aircraft the standard weight empty will indicate the weight of the aircraft with no fuel passengers or payload on board find the maximum gross weight of the aircraft the maximum gross weight is the upper limit of weight that the aircraft may be loaded to without structural damage look up the maximum takeoff weight the maximum takeoff weight is the most that the aircraft can weigh during take off determine the maximum landing weight the maximum landing weight is the most that the aircraft can weigh during landing without risking damage to the landing gear note the fuel capacity of the aircraft the fuel capacity will be listed in either u s gallons or imperial gallons calculate the weight of fuel carried the fuel tanks may not be loaded to capacity so use the weight of only the fuel known to be added calculate the weight as 6 lbs per u s gallon 2 72 kg per 3 79 l or 7 2 lbs per imperial gallon 3 23 kg per 4 72l if the fuel used is aviation gas calculate the weight as 6 6 lbs per u s gallon 3 0 kg per 3 79 l or 8 0 lbs per imperial gallon 3 6 kg per 4 72 l if the fuel used is jp 4 determine the maximum payload the maximum payload is the difference between the standard weight empty plus the weight of fuel carried and either the maximum gross weight or the maximum takeoff weight whichever is less in almost every case the maximum takeoff weight will be less and should be used for the calculation 1 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source divide the payload between people and cargo count the aircraft crew as people if known the actual weight should be used if the actual weights of the crew are not known estimate the weights as 174 lbs 79 0 kg per male and 127 lbs 57 6 kg per female add 8 lbs 3 6 kg to each crew member weight for summer clothing and 14 lbs 6 4 kg per crew member for winter clothing add the passenger weights count each male passenger as 174 lbs 79 0 kg each female passenger as 127 lbs 57 6 kg and each child as 75 lbs 34 0 kg add 8 lbs 3 6 kg to each adult for summer clothing and 14 lbs 6 4 kg for each adult for winter clothing use 75 lbs 34 0 kg per child without adding an additional factor for clothing weight subtract the crew and passenger weights from the payload the resulting calculated weight is available for baggage and cargo do not consider the volume of the aircraft to carry luggage and cargo the weight limits will be reached before the aircraft runs out of space to hold the cargo take maximum landing weight into account the maximum landing weight will be less than the maximum takeoff weight the aircraft must have consumed enough fuel at the manufacturer s fuel consumption per thrust rate to reduce the total aircraft weight below the maximum landing weight before a landing can be made if emergency conditions require an early landing fuel or cargo but not passengers must be jettisoned to reduce the weight of the aircraft to the maximum landing weight 2 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to clean an ultra lite carburetor,how to clean a carburetor for a small ultra lite aircraft this can be used for most carburetors because the principals of this job are similar,first step is to remove the carburetor from the vehicle and drain most if not all the fuel from it you can also remove the fuel lines and vent lines at this time next is to flip over the carburetor and remove the bowl it is attached to the carb with usually 3 or 4 phillips screws on the bottom once removed you can now see the internals of your carburetor if the inside of the bowl is dirty you know that you carburetor inside are likely to be as well now that you are inside the carb you can remove the float it is held in by the pin that can be pushed through and the float will lift out you can see at this point if the float isn t moving freely you could have a sticky float resulting in excessive flooding of the engine make sure this is working freely on re install now you can start cleaning out your jets one at a time first you can remove the high speed jet the one with the slot on top it is removed with a flat screwdriver once removed you can look at it against a light and see if it is clogged or not if this is you can soak it for a minute in engine degreaser and then hit it with compressed air to blast out the debris this may need to be done a few times until fully clear of dirt once clean re install make sure not to tighten excessively now you can remove the main jet to clean it it is usually the one sticking up higher and usually a hex headed 1 4 brass jet urn it out of the carb and inspect for a clogged passage you can soak it in degreaser and blast it with compressed air as well repeat that to make sure it is cleaned right out look down the passage where the main jet came from and blast air down to clean it out as well now you can re install the main jet check now to make sure you choke lever and butterfly are working properly and not sticking or hesitant remove linkage and lubricate to help in ease of operation clean intake of carburetor so no debris gets into the engine you can now blow the compressed air through all passageways in the carb to make sure no more clogs are in there do all the jets intake ports idle ports overflow ports and where ever you can blow the air blow the hole carb out to loosen and remove all the tiny particles of debris now that the internals have been all cleaned out you can clean out the bowl and underside of the carburetor to make sure no more dirt gets back through your freshly cleaned carb you can soak the bowl in some degreaser to loosen some stuck on dirt be sure to wipe and clean all dirt at this stage so that no more gets inside this will later help in less problems with clogged up internals you can now re install the float and pin now you can make sure that your pin is lubed with wd or whichever you choose to make that float operation smoother just a little spray on the pin and where it meets the float will help so much push the pin through the post coming from the carburetor and through the float mount and back through the other side post no need to fasten it there because once the bowl is installed it will hold it all together your almost done you can re install your bowl and fasten it with the three phillips screws make sure not to over tighten and strip these once re installed check final operation of the choke and blow last bits of dirt away you can also hear the float moving if you shake it easily once all clean you can install you fuel lines and vent hoses and its all ready for re installation on the vehicle,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to prepare to fly an airplane in an emergency,in the event that the pilot has a medical emergency the following steps should provide enough information to help you get the aircraft safely to the nearest airport these steps provide a realistic and achievable guide provided you keep two things in mind it will not be easy so preparation ahead of time is essential you will have to concentrate 100 on flying the plane and leave the pilot s medical condition alone job 1 is getting the plane on the ground safely newer aircraft have a very elaborate glass panel instrument system but that will not be covered in detail by this article if needed you will be able to understand the more complex glass panel instruments and controls by becoming intimately familiar with the basic six instruments in a cessna 172 one of the most common aircraft,study a cessna 172 aircraft instrument panel it is a standard aircraft panel with six round basic flight instruments sometimes called the six pack these are the ones in the center directly in front of the pilot s seat note too that some aircraft will also have a set of instruments and controls in the co pilot position familiarize yourself with the six pack the six instruments will be located in the following order top left the airspeed indicator shows aircraft airspeed usually in knots a knot is one nautical mile per hour about 1 15 mph or 1 85km hr top center the artificial horizon shows the aircraft attitude that is how the plane is inclined in all directions whether the plane is climbing or descending and how it is banking left or right top right the altimeter shows the height altitude of the aircraft in feet msl feet above mean or average sea level lower left the turn and bank indicator is a dual instrument which tells how fast you are changing the compass heading rate of turn and also whether you are in co ordinated flight feeling the proper down in the seat gs from the turn this is also called the turn and slip indicator or needle ball lower center is the heading indicator which shows the current compass heading keep in mind that small amounts of friction in the heading gyro dictate that this instrument be calibrated on an ongoing basis this is explained below in the calibration procedure lower right is the vertical speed indicator which tells how fast you are going higher or lower it gives the rate of descent or climb in feet per minute zero means that you are maintaining altitude and are neither climbing nor descending test your knowledge of the six pack using the 172 panel photograph above can you tell by reading the six pack panel instruments what the aircraft s current situation is your answer should have been the aircraft is in a slightly climbing left turn cruising at a speed of 110 knots about 3 100 feet 944 9 m above sea level on a heading of 178 almost due south study the the aircraft controls the necessary controls for this mission will be as follows throttle a black knob when pushed forward the engine is at full throttle and when pulled full back the engine is idling fuel mixture a red knob pushed full inward is the richest mixture used for sea level takeoffs and landings while full back is engine off only pull the red knob full out when you are on the ground and ready to shut down the engine carburetor heat used to warm the engine air intake in icing conditions and on long descents with engine at idle conditions where a cold engine with cold air could cause icing note that for all practical purposes this has to be either full on or full off flaps a flat handled switch to select the wing flap positions this will be used for slowing the aircraft to a safe speed in preparation for landing the aircraft note that the flaps should be advanced notch by notch one position 10 at a time fuel tank select a cessna 172 would almost always be set on both tanks steering wheel yoke this sets the attitude climb and turn and the speed of the aircraft use small pitch adjustments in and out for pitch to climb or descend turn the yoke left and right to bank the aircraft engine rpm is used for setting engine speed power for climbing descending and or landing rudder pedals these are operated by your feet press the top edge of the pedals and the brakes are applied of course this only has an effect when you are on the ground pressing the lower part of the pedals allows steering while on the runway and helps do quality turns in the air you will also use the lower part of the rudder pedals to stay lined up with the runway while on final approach control trim there are two trim wheels in the panel which when adjusted properly give you almost hands off control you will not be using these in an emergency be aware too if you do try to use them to trim for landing you may not have enough pitch control to gain altitude quickly in case of a go around you would have to re trim in case of a go around but it is way better to just stay away from these controls and consider them off limits become familiar with the navigation and communication equipment the radio or nav com equipment is used to navigate the plane and importantly to talk to the tower or atc air traffic control in an emergency call them as soon as you get the aircraft under control get someone to show you how to set or change radio frequency in order to communicate with atc the airport tower changing frequency may not be necessary but you should know how to do this and should take the time to practice before you are in an emergency situation so that you will not get hung up on this when an emergency does arise communication is a critical aspect of surviving an emergency situation there is little chance that you will be able to land safely without the tower and their guidance ask your pilot for the emergency frequency commit the emergency frequency to memory just in case you may need it practice changing frequencies work until this becomes second nature and you can switch and tune frequencies easily and naturally know when not to change frequencies if you are already talking to atc then stay on that frequency as long as you can atc will tell you when to change frequencies do not go to emergency frequency just tell atc that you are declaring an emergency they will help you get home safely do whatever they ask of you and be sure to get confirmation about anything you are not sure of before you take action learn in an actual aircraft it is best if you reinforce what you learned about the six pack and the basic controls in an actual plane preferably in a cessna 172 solidify your understanding of the instrument panel and controls while in the aircraft using a printout of the above steps see if you can point to and touch every instrument and control listed at the same time say aloud what each is used for quiz yourself on each of the instruments not only should you immediately be able to name each instrument at a glance but also describe the information you get from each instrument look at the gauges and see if you can determine the normal operating ranges then ask yourself what basic actions you would have to perform to correct for certain conditions for example if you were slightly descending and wanted to get back to level flight what would you have to do take a few moments to deeply think about the scenarios you imagine and visualize the correct action you might take this will prime your mind to absorb further lessons it is highly recommended that you spend enough time doing this to feel like you have it mastered up to this point you should at a minimum have a good feel for what information each instrument gives and how it relates to the plane position and near term flight path target and master each of the instruments and controls the airspeed indicator top left has arcs colored in green yellow white and red normal airspeed will of course be in the green and the lower edge of green indicates the flap up stall speed try your best to keep the instrument in the green arc while cruising use the yoke to adjust nose up and nose down pitch to set the airspeed do not use the throttle to adjust airspeed the red line is the never exceed speed line stay out of there the white range is safe flap lowering speed and the lower end of white is the stall speed for full flaps down only used when on final approach for landing the artificial horizon has a miniature aircraft in the center in straight and level flight it should stay there if it starts to drift use the yoke to re center and or level the small airplane on the horizon line the altimeter may start to wind or unwind if you seek to maintain level flight use the yoke to stabilize your altitude you can see that you will have to scan these six instruments to maintain control of the aircraft that s why the six are right together in front of the pilot scan them often the needle ball should stay centered when you are in level flight and turning the aircraft when turning the needle ball graphically shows you the quality of the turn you re making strive to keep your turns very shallow less than 10 this will keep you out of trouble which is what you are after whenever you fly a plane particularly for the first time and particularly in an emergency the heading indicator should be on the heading you are trying to fly if not use the yoke to make one or a series of very shallow turn s to stay on course don t chase the heading too much just make very small corrections and patiently wait for the reading to settle that will feed back on how you re doing and you can correct a bit again if needed the vertical speed also should be centered at zero in level flight if not make small pitch corrections with the yoke don t chase the rate of change of ascent or descent make one small correction same as above and continue scanning the instruments develop the mindset and habit of making only the smallest of corrections when you incorporate all of the six pack in your scan routine the scanning will get a little harder to do the small corrections procedure is the same for all changes you will perform to control the aircraft get this thoroughly in your noggin and ingrain it in your being learn how to calibrate the heading indicator it is critical to calibrate this instrument on an ongoing basis usually 3 5 times an hour if the heading indicator is off only a couple of degrees you will not arrive at the airport where you intend to land therefore it is critical to take hands on instruction in the calibration of this instrument it is normally adjusted to agree with the magnetic compass before takeoff and re adjusted periodically in flight to correct for gyro precession errors set the heading indicator only in stabilized straight and level flight learn the phases of normal flight straight and level flight climb descent work hard to understand straight level flight in this phase you use the yoke to maintain level by keeping the small airplane level and centered on the artificial horizon line during daylight hours this can be done just by looking out the windshield at the real horizon alternatively you can scan the six pack and use the feedback to maintain level in either case always make sure to look outside and to scan the six pack when possible do not rely on one or the other when both are available ensure that the rpm gauge is indicating a cruise setting of between 2100 and 2700 rpm when you are in straight and level cruise flight you can adjust the rpm using the throttle understand the mechanics of the climbing phase climbing is normally done under full throttle but if only a gradual climb is necessary you can pull back on the yoke to raise the aircraft nose about five and no more than ten degrees above the horizon while advancing the throttle slightly remember to also continually scan the six pack at all times and make very sure that nothing else is changing scanning the six pack will let you know if you start into a turn start to bank the aircraft or the airspeed starts to drop if an unwanted bank starts gently turn the yoke the other direction and if the airspeed diminishes level off for a bit and advance the throttle a little more next time you try to climb the cessna 172 can stall in a turn at approximately 65 knots no flaps so keep your turns shallow and avoid any speed below 80 knots to allow yourself a margin of safety remember to boost the speed by lowering the nose slightly and or adding a little throttle when necessary again use gentle corrections and stay well out of the danger zones that are indicated on the instruments get a good feel for what transpires during descent phase there are two scenarios one for landing at an airport that is near your current position and one for landing at one that is farther away a descent to land at a nearby airport is done by reducing the throttle to an engine speed of about 1800 to 1500 rpm while setting the air fuel mixture at full richness red knob fully inward if the descent will cause you to be a long time at low engine power then you may have to use carburetor heat to prevent icing at reduced rpms the engine will not be producing as much heat and you may have to kick on the carburetor heat do so only if the weather indicates possible icing conditions here the tower can give you guidance so ask if you aren t sure if you re descending for a landing at an airport further away reduce throttle to 2000 rpm to descend while maintaining a higher airspeed however don t get going too fast watch the airspeed indicator and avoid going very far into the yellow arc become intimately familiar with the landing phase this will be the most critical part of your maiden flight again there are two main ways to approach landing at any airport the standard traffic pattern 45 angle to the runway and the straight in lined up with the runway emergency approach we will assume that you have clearance for the emergency approach after all that is what this is an emergency practice in a high quality simulator or under the direction of a qualified flight instructor the landing phase is the hardest to do successfully ideally several landings should be practiced in a simulator or in an actual aircraft if at all possible practicing landings ahead of time is highly recommended know the appropriate conditions for a straight in approach the straight in approach is preferred in an emergency so maintain a higher altitude until you have the airport runway in sight then you can start your descent keeping the runway in sight be sure to ask for the airport with the longest runway and preferably for an airport where atc uses radar plan to be about four miles from the chosen runway at an altitude of 1 000 feet 304 8 m agl above ground level hopefully you will be in contact with tower by then and they can advise you with the aid of their radar if not then you have to make the approach yourself descend toward the 1 000 feet 304 8 m level above the runway and slow the aircraft set the throttle to 1500 rpm with a vertical descent rate of 500 feet 152 4 m per minute and an airspeed of 80 knots lower the flaps a notch at this point remember to move the flaps only one notch at a time plan on full flaps down by the time you are five miles out if your altitude is at least 1 000 ft set the throttle to idle at this point with the mixture at full richness red knob in use carburetor heat only if weather indicates possible icing conditions each time you lower the flaps a notch 10 push forward on the yoke a little to counteract the tendency of the flaps to raise the nose add more pitch down to keep your speed at 75 knots if necessary you can slowly reduce your speed to 65 or 70 knots now stabilize the plane in line with the runway at four miles out the airspeed should be 65 knots with full flaps and a descent rate of 500 feet 152 4 m per minute check to ensure the throttle is still at idle use the rudder pedals to stay in line with the runway not the yoke use the yoke only for pitch control nose up and down at this point unless there is a crosswind then you may have to use the yoke to bank slightly into the wind use only the rudder pedals to continually line up with the runway and stay on course hold that attitude and airspeed keep everything the same all the way to about three to four feet above the runway then start slowly raising the nose as the aircraft settles to the runway called the flare continue to hold the nose wheel off the runway after the main gear touch down apply brakes as soon as the nose wheel touches the runway if you re coming in a bit hot going a little too fast you can also raise the flaps to get better braking remember that the lower part of the rudder pedals help you to steer while you are on the ground while the upper parts do the braking pilots say any landing you can walk away from is a good landing nice job know how to perform an emergency go around if need be the go around is a very dangerous maneuver even for experienced pilots and is not recommended for a beginner however if at any time in your approach or landing you see or anticipate major problems where things are not lining up as planned a go around is required apply full power smoothly and increase the pitch nose up to climb make sure the carburetor heat is off and the fuel mixture is full rich do all this simultaneously while raising the flaps slowly a notch at a time re trim pitch for a climb this action helps reduce the yoke pressure hopefully you noticed the advice about considering the trim wheels off limits and heeded that advice so this step will not be needed it is only included here as a part of a complete checklist for the go round maneuver climb out at 80 knots once your airspeed reaches 80 knots do not raise the nose any further and if the airspeed drops below 80 knots lower the nose a bit to prevent a stall level off at 1 000 feet 304 8 m above ground level agl make a wide arc gently turn the aircraft in a wide circle until you are lined up on the runway still at 1 000 feet 304 8 m agl attempt the landing all over again be alert to the danger the mechanics of the human inner ear allows you to detect a change in motion or a change in velocity in any direction realize that your body senses only changes and also be aware that your mind has been trusting what the inner ear says each day of your life for a long long time this is a hard thing to break away from but it is absolutely critical to be able to ignore what your body is telling you because it may be wrong instead when you do not have supplementary visual input rely solely on the instruments switch to total reliance on the instruments once you lose your ability to see clearly once you lose the ability to determine your plane s spatial orientation by using visible cues either the horizon a beacon or a landmark you must compel yourself to rely solely on the instruments and force yourself to discard what your body is telling you understand the nature of the danger the tendency of untrained pilots is to fly by the seat of the pants and to enter the death spiral a series of actions which inevitably leads to a crash if you enter a banking turn and stay there in co ordinated flight for twenty seconds or so your body gets acclimated to the turn and thinks you are flying straight and level when you are still in a banking turn in the dark or when visibility is limited you have no visual cues to correct the impression your body has picked up the death spiral starts when you notice you are losing altitude common in banking turns and pull up on the yoke to gain altitude the problem comes from being in a banking turn pulling back on the yoke results in tightening the turn and a further loss of altitude not in gaining altitude the natural tendency is then to pull back even more on the yoke and that makes things even worse moral of the story trust the artificial horizon refer to the little plane s exact attitude within the artificial horizon before you attempt any altitude correction make sure you are in straight level flight before you make an altitude correction this will be apparent on the artificial horizon provided the heading indicator is relatively constant be highly aware that any loss of altitude might be the result of entering a banking turn without realizing it this will be evident on the artificial horizon and on your heading indicator if your heading is changing you are turning rely only on the instruments if you have little or no visibility

how to fuel a plane,ever wanted to know how to fuel a plane fuelling a plane is not the same as filling up your car by following the steps outlined in the following instructions you will have the necessary knowledge to be able to refuel an airplane safely,determine what fuel grade is required for your aircraft 1 x research source determine how much fuel is required connect the ground wire to the aircraft 2 x research source for high wing aircraft put ladder in front of the fuel cap on the furthest fuel tank 3 x research source drag out fuel hose for as far as you need it 4 x research source as you see in the video this is not like fuelling your car on larger aircraft you must fill up the wings first simply for the balance of the plane while fuelling make sure all selected valves are correctly opened if they are not check with the pilot or contact maintenance 5 x research source you must fill up the wing tanks before fuelling the centre tank after fuelling reinstall fuel cap and close the panel correctly 6 x research source wind up fuel hose 7 x research source wind up ground wire double check fuel caps are tight 8 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to survive a plane crash on a deserted island,plane crashes are one of the least likely accident to occur with the number of accidents being less than 1 accident per million flights in the unlikely situation that you find yourself on a deserted island it is essential to know a few basic steps to survive the days that are to follow read on to find out how,tend to the injured if one of your fellow passengers is a trained professional like a doctor or nurse do what they say if not you will have to take matters into your own hands use the process of triage assess the status of each survivor a person who is screaming or moaning is obviously alive but a silent person is not they are likely to have more severe injuries and should be attended to first when tending to an injured person check their pulse first put your ear against the person s mouth to hear feel if they re breathing if they re not attempt cpr if they re bleeding find a rag or rip off your own clothing apply pressure and tie the cloth around the wound tightly to control bleeding do what you can gather food you may find berries in the forest but be careful they may be poisonous to see if they are cut the berry in half and rub it on your wrist wait if nothing happens rub a little of it on the edge of your mouth wait if nothing happens rub a little of it on your lip wait if nothing happens put it in your mouth and slowly chew there is probably food on the plane so try to rummage through the wreckage and find some make spears out of sharpened wood to hunt bury or burn someone s body in the tragic event that someone died during the crash and if rescue hasn t arrived for four days consider these measures the rotting bodies could cause disease and attract wild animals make sure you leave no remnants of the dead bodies make huge bonfires this will help rescue planes to find you make shelters use pieces of the plane wood leaves from the forest and anything else you can find build a fort if necessary find water water is most important there may be bottled water on the plane the best way to get water is to explore the island a little bit but don t stray too far from camp try to find a river stream lake or other fresh body of water if it looks foggy nothing is alive around it or it looks like there is oil in it do not drink it do not drink salt water salt water will quicken dehydration if you can t find water here are other ways get a plastic blanket and some big strong sticks and put the sticks up next tie the blankets to the sticks and when it rains the rain catcher will collect water,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to choose a private jet charter company,as the pace of your life accelerates it s clear that your time is becoming too valuable to spend waiting in airports for delayed flights to activities or meetings that had to be postponed until you arrived you begin thinking about private jet charter a faster easier more customized way to travel to your destination luckily flying in a private jet is one of the safest and most luxurious ways to travel unlike commercial airlines private jets fly in and out of smaller suburban airports that are closer to departure and destination points also typically smaller airports do not have the long lines or delays passengers have come to expect at any of today s large urban airports,identify the right charter broker or operator yes one could check

advertisements created by the companies themselves use the web to look for online directories of faa authorized charter operators charter brokers and their locations and the various aircraft they offer there are a number of charter brokers who appear to have many aircraft but in reality are serving in a capacity similar to a travel agent this statement is true brokers do not have operational control over any aircraft they get quotes from operators put their fee on top of that and retail it charter brokers are not faa authorized and do not have any aircraft under their control if you like the idea of using a travel agent keep in mind that a quality faa authorized operator can access a jet anywhere in the world just like a broker now that you have a list of operators their aircraft and phone numbers you need to ask a few basic questions validate the charter company the next step is verifying the charter company s advertising claims through official documentation in order to simplify this complicated task one can break down the process into three categories federal aviation administration faa documentation insurance and third party audits faa documentation each charter company must have a valid part 135 air taxi certificate which authorizes it to fly for hire obtaining a part 135 certificate requires the charter company to adhere to faa guidelines and is strictly enforced by the faa ask for a copy of their air carrier certificate which is the official document granted by the faa if a charter company does not have an air carrier certificate they are not authorized by

be available around the clock for if you must change your plans make a special request or ask a question you will get a great sense of their level of service by how you are treated on the phone does the agent take time with you ask questions to ensure they understand what is important to you are they polite and most importantly are they responsive select an aircraft often a charter company will provide pictures of an aircraft under consideration for a trip be warned however that pictures are deceiving and may not be current the only way absolutely ensure the status of an aircraft is to view it personally also because insurance levels can change at any time and vary by aircraft within the same fleet it is important to ask for a copy of the insurance policy before each and every flight check up on your pilot find out what the provider s standards are for minimum pilot hours different jet types require different pilot hours once you have chosen an aircraft verify that the assigned pilot has the required number of pilot hours on that type of craft generally each captain should have at least 5000 total flight hours and 300 hours in the specific aircraft type ask how often the pilots attend recurrent training in a full motion simulator once every six months is considered ideal anything less the pilot may not be as fresh as possible on the latest procedures find out how much it will cost as the details of your needs become more specific you should be able to get a clear quote not a vague estimate that leaves room for surprises on the final invoice any always ask for a hard quote yes certain things such as catering ground transportation and flight phone usage are not known before the flight but everything else should be a firm quote so you are not surprised by the

how to buy a used airplane,before you take off into the beckoning skies you go over your aircraft with a checklist it s a safety precaution that we wouldn t ever want to go without the same is true for buying an airplane particularly a used one like buying a car the experience can be enjoyable or a complete headache but with some planning you can take the headache out of finding the aircraft that matches your needs and skill level,choose the right airplane for you determine what your needs are now not what you expect them to be in the future are you going to use the airplane primarily for family trips or will it be used for business also consider your budget what you pay for an aircraft is only part of the cost of ownership don t forget to include the cost of operation and maintenance too many pilots don t have a definite amount set for what they are willing to spend as a result they keep increasing what they are willing to spend as they come across airplanes that are just beyond their financial reach shop around for the right aircraft once you have picked out a specific aircraft type that will meet your needs and budget start comparing individual craft here are some factors that can affect your buying decision total time the lower total time the more expensive the aircraft aircraft blue book and the aircraft value reference vref have formulas to help you determine how total time affects the price of an aircraft engine time aircraft engines have a life expectancy known as tbo time before overhaul established by the manufacturer this number reflects when the average engine will need an overhaul exterior interior condition what is the overall condition of the plane look for things like corrosion or the condition of the seats avionics the condition of the avionics can make a difference in the value of a plane aircraft blue book and vref have formulas for calculating the value of avionics get the specifics on the plane you pick knowing the history of an aircraft is important get as much information related to the aircraft as possible this will include specifications maintenance history damage etc aircraft with damage may still be a good craft but you might want to consult a broker to help you determine the true value most home built aircraft accidents occur with secondhand owners if you re purchasing a home built aircraft be sure to ask the seller about any potential quirks so that you aren t surprised take a test flight leave the window open and listen as you crank up the engine check the gauges during takeoff and get a feel for the aircraft in flight make sure to check that all the avionics are functioning properly put down a deposit once you have chosen the airplane you want you will need to put down a deposit to take it off the market this can be done through an escrow service if you are not comfortable with handing your money over directly to the seller you should be agreeable to the terms of the sale and make sure your money is refundable in the event the deal falls apart perform a pre purchase inspection this is the responsibility of the buyer and a good investment hire a trusted mechanic to give the aircraft a thorough inspection provide the mechanic with a list of the craft s specifications along with a pre purchase inspection checklist some financing companies require this order a title search make certain there are no old liens on the aircraft before you purchase it get insurance shop around for a good insurance policy your experience level as a pilot plays a major role in the type of aircraft you can get insurance for speaking with an insurance agent ahead of time will let you know if you are wasting your time looking at aircraft you won t be able to get insured make your final payment and schedule a pickup of your plane finally enjoy your new aircraft,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to learn aerobatics,if you have been to an air show and seen pilots perform daring loops and rolls you know how fascinating and complex it is understand that it takes actual flying lessons to learn how to do aerobatics as it is extremely dangerous to learn and do without instruction but this article can help you to understand some basics,start off flying straight and level with no change of altitude or roll push the throttle up to full and pitch slightly down by doing this you are building up the speed to get you over the top at about 120 knots pull back hard on the stick g force will push you into your seat but don t worry about it just keep pulling back at the invert gradually relax the pressure and pull back on the stick carry on pulling back until you are once again straight and level that is the procedure for a basic loop fly straight and level push the throttle up to full and pitch slightly down by doing this you are building up the speed to get you up into the vertical at about 120 knots pull back on the stick until you are going vertically upwards keep the plane heading up when you are near to falling backwards push the rudder either left or right the plane will fall backwards and tilt to the way your rudder is it will twist round and start to descend vertically pull out until straight and level again that is the procedure for a stall turn fly straight and level go to 3 4 throttle roll your wings to quarter roll input opposite rudder to the roll and hold for exit level your wings and take the rudder out make your throttle 1 2 to 3 4 throttle roll right to first quarter add left rudder to steady the plane roll right another quarter to inverted add down elevator to keep the nose up roll right another quarter add right rudder to steady the plane roll right another quarter to level fast four point rolls do not require as much rudder and elevator slow 4 point rolls require a lot,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to discern what is a paraglider and what is not a paraglider,historically people have stepped through visual and sound cues to discern type of aircraft especially during war others make a hobby of stepping through identification cues in discerning the species of birds well there is confusion in aviation about just what a paraglider is or is not here we take steps to form a decision about what kind of hang glider we might see is what we see a paraglider or not incomplete and even false definitions about what is and is not a paraglider arrive from cult and commercial influences such is inadequate for a creative student of aviation an inventor a seeker of options in free flight an engineer an author a teacher etc what is wanted is a path to clarity about just what is and is not a paraglider apart from narrow interests of course for the narrow interests they know what they know let s go for more and for clarity,locate the tethers does the aircraft have one or more tethers at least one tether is needed find the wings does the aircraft have one or more wings at least one wing is needed it is narrow perspective and false to force soft canopy for the set of wings certainly there are soft canopy paragliders but there are also stiff framed paraglider and fully solid wings may be the wing or wings of a paraglider find out how the aircraft deals with free falling mass does the aircraft have a freely falling mass at the lower end of the tether or tethers some mass is needed to be pulled by gravity at the end of the tether or tethers that go up to the wing or wings check to make sure the tether maintains tension in flight does the tether generally stay in tension because of the deflective actions of the coupled wing or wings with the mass at the lower end of the tether or tethers if there are other objects in the aircraft that have the potential to propel the aircraft up or forward then are those in off status a paraglider is unpowered if powered then it becomes a powered paraglider when the aircraft is set into free fall does the aircraft glide even a small positive amount with the above steps cleared one probably has a paraglider in focus you will notice that some hang gliders that are not regularly called paragliders are actually mechanically paragliders you have done the steps of how to discern an aircraft type congratulations,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to become a pilot in the united kingdom,becoming a pilot takes extreme dedication as you are required to pass multiple wellness tests go through hundreds of hours of training and pay a lot of money to get your airline transport pilot license there are two main methods of pilot training modular and integrated training modular training takes aspiring pilots from zero experience to flight ready in gradual stages while integrated training aims to take you from zero experience to a commercial pilot s license in the shortest possible time getting your license is challenging but it can lead to a lucrative career in aviation,try modular training to fit school around your schedule modular training takes longer than integral training because the student starts by qualifying to be a private pilot before training to become a commercial pilot trainees complete 100 hours of private pilot studying before moving on to the 700 plus hours of work needed to get ready for commercial pilot training modular training takes at least 18 months to complete 1 x research source the total flying time for the modular training method is 220 hours airlines see the benefits of hiring modular method graduates pilots who choose this method tend to come from more varied backgrounds than people who pick the integrated method this is looked at as an advantage when it comes to working as a member of a cockpit take classes at your own pace and pay as you go this is a great way to ensure that you don t pay for something without getting value for it modular training allows you to complete one aspect of training and then come back to the next part of training on your own time 2 x research source sometimes people need to work to save money to pay for the next part of training this is completely doable for modular training but it may take a few years to get your pilot license at that rate use weekends and evenings to train while working extremely dedicated students will try this method even if it is incredibly time consuming fortunately flight schools understand how tough this commitment is and work with students to schedule their training in a way that makes the most of their time 3 x research source when you reach the end of one part of training schools will encourage you to take a full week to focus only on the material at hand this helps students be as prepared as they can for upcoming tests and exams pick integrated flight training to get your pilot s license quickly if you have the time to focus solely on getting your airline transport pilot license go with this method it generally takes trainees between 14 and 18 months to finish this program depending on things like weather and student progress 4 x research source integrated flight training includes more than 700 hours of classes across 14 subjects you complete several progress tests and fly for 200 total hours to obtain your commercial license monitor your progress to ensure you re learning as much as you can as a full time student your progress is monitored at each stage of training you will have chances to retake ground exams and flight tests if you fail them the first time and you can do so without having to wait very long 5 x research source keep in mind that airlines look more favorably on students who pass tests the first time and do so with high marks surround yourself with like minded students to learn efficiently one of the nice parts of integrated flight training is that you get to work with other aspiring pilots being in this kind of a setting allows you to learn information more efficiently as you ll have numerous people to work with when it comes time to study 6 x research source taking classes this way gives you a great opportunity to network with fellow students and see what kind of job openings are available when you ve completed training obtain a class 1 medical certificate before you can even think about getting in the cockpit you will have to pass a number of tests related to physical well being eyesight medical history and other important factors the doctor who administers your examination needs to specialize in aviation medicine book an appointment and complete a medical certificate application form before going in for your test the examination can take up to four hours 7 x research source there are set charges for all examinations and tests ask your medical examiner for specifics the medical certificate application form includes facts about your medical history results of previous medical examinations and whether you have ever been assessed as unfit or had a medical certificate suspended or revoked a medical certificate can be issued the same day as the exam if you meet all the requirements most class 1 medical certificates are valid for 12 months if you are 60 or older however the certificate is valid for 6 months book and pass a selection test by showing good technical and people skills many flight schools require you to pass a series of tests that gauge your suitability to be a pilot and judge your ability to be a team player the selection is made up of an english exam a math and physics exam a compass aptitude test and a personal interview the tests take about one day to complete 8 x research source an english exam is not required for native speakers each training school has its own test but they are broadly similar a compass aptitude test is a pilot specific exam that looks at a person s ability to multi task capacity for memory and hand eye coordination among other things score well on the atpl ground exams this part of training requires the student to pass 14 different tests these exams cover subjects like navigation flight planning and aviation law 9 x research source for many aspiring pilots this is the most demanding aspect of training because of the sheer amount of information they need to cover complete flight training to qualify for a commercial pilot license this is the fun part most of your flight training will take place in america or southern europe because these places offer cheaper flying and generally better weather than the uk you will need to fly for at least 150 hours to earn your commercial pilot license part of your flying will come at night as you need to qualify for this on its own earning a cpl allows you to get paid to fly which is what makes it such an important stepping stone during this process secure an instrument rating to be a plane dashboard expert an instrument rating is a gauge of how well a pilot navigates in bad weather using only their instruments in the cockpit this is an incredibly difficult rating to attain because it includes a challenging written exam and hours of instruction but it is designed to make you a sharper pilot there are accelerated courses you can take which will allow you to get an instrument rating in less than two weeks the test itself consists of at least one cross country flight performed under instrument flight rules 10 x research source you are required to hold a private pilot certificate and have logged at least 50 hours of flying to apply for an instrument rating earn a multi engine rating to master flying twin engine planes a multi engine rating qualifies you to fly airplanes with two engines an essential for people looking to make a career in this field this rating is far easier to achieve than an instrument rating you can spend one weekend taking an intensive training course and walk away with a multi engine rating in your wallet 11 x research source there is no written test for a multi engine rating a quick course can get you a multi engine rating but in order to become a proficient multi engine pilot you should take your time and go through a thorough training program show that you can work in a team setting part of training is learning how to cooperate with other members of the crew this is required for most professional pilots as the majority of their flights will be done with a co pilot 12 x research source network with your classmates to find a job in the field many aspiring pilots come to training with either flying experience or knowledge of the industry connect with as many of your classmates as possible to see who might know how to navigate the job hunt best 13 x research source remember part of the requirement of being a pilot is being able to work in a team employers love to see people who are engaging with fellow students and willing to help classmates out keep in contact with your training school to ask about openings many flight schools work directly with specific airlines so it is important to use this as an opportunity to put yourself in front of potential employers in fact training schools teach the standard operating procedures of specific airlines making the hiring process easier for the airlines 14 x research source airlines are much more willing to hire someone who is already familiar with the way they work that extra training can take a lot of time so focus on mastering the way they operate get an aviation related degree to find other work in the industry since aviation is an incredibly competitive field you may not find the job you re looking for right away having a degree in this field makes you more versatile and attractive to employers once you have your foot in the door you are one step closer to your dream job 15 x research source many training schools offer a degree alongside pilot training to make it easier for the student to break into the field an example of a non pilot aviation job is flight

how to fly a hot air balloon,hot air balloon enthusiasts can be found worldwide and may offer rides for a price or a volunteer position on their ground crew if you ve already got a taste and want to be the person pulling the strings and lighting the fire you ll need training and certification before you can fly solo learning how a balloon operates will give you a head start and can help you decide whether this hobby is for you,understand why a balloon rises hot air balloons are based on a simple concept as you heat air or any other gas it becomes less dense just like a bubble rising in an aquarium the hot air will float above the denser colder air around it 1 x research source get the air in the balloon hot enough and it can lift the balloon canvas the basket and everyone inside it as well air gets progressively thinner less dense as you travel upward because there is less pressure from the weight of the air above it 2 x research source because of this a hot air balloon only rises until it reaches the point where the density of the balloon plus the air inside it is equal to the density of the air around it know the basic structure the structure is so simple that you may already understand it but learn the terminology so you and your crew can communicate to each other the fabric balloon itself is called an envelope made from sewn panels called gores in most balloons there s a hole at the top of the envelope tightly covered by a flap of fabric this is called a parachute valve 3 x research source it is attached to a rip line that runs all the way down to the basket the bottom end of the envelope or mouth is located above a burner which produces flame fueled by the propane tanks underneath the propane tanks passengers and cargo all stand in a basket attached beneath the envelope wear protective clothing the pilot should wear safety goggles since they will be close to the flame pilot and crew should wear heavy duty gloves long sleeves and long pants and avoid nylon polyester or other materials that melt when exposed to flame everyone in the basket should keep in mind that the balloon may land in mud or rough terrain and wear comfortable clothes and shoes let out more propane to rise all it takes to add propane to the fire is opening a simple blast valve on the line attached to the propane tanks typically located just beneath the burner 4 x research source the wider you hold the valve open the more heat rushes into the balloon and the faster it rises dropping ballast or any heavy object over the side of the balloon will reduce the overall density of the balloon and cause you to rise for obvious reasons this method is not recommended above populated areas learn how to stay at a stable height like any object hotter than the surrounding environment the hot air balloon cools down over time which causes it to sink gradually in order to stay at the same height you ll need to use one or both of these techniques the propane tank themselves have a metering valve or cruise that controls how much propane feeds the burner gradually opening this as you fly is an easy way to stay at roughly the same altitude a short burst of additional propane from the blast valve will lift the balloon up when you notice it dipping too low open the parachute valve to lower the balloon remember the parachute valve is the flap of fabric on the top of the balloon envelope this flap automatically seals itself when left alone but you can pull a red cord called a rip line to lift the flap this lets hot air escape from the top keep the cord pulled until the balloon is lowering at the desired rate then let go to close the flap again the parachute valve is also called a deflation port and the rip line a deflation port line raise or lower to control direction balloons have no direct way to control the direction they travel however there are typically several layers of wind stacked on top of each other blowing in different directions raise or lower the balloon to catch a different cross stream and your balloon will change direction pilots often need to improvise the route as they go along to some extent and it takes experience and planning to catch the right wind at the right time many balloons have cords that pull open side vents or flaps on the side of the envelope but these just rotate the basket almost all hot air balloon flights are shadowed by a car or truck on the ground picking up the balloon and its passengers once it lands take a training course before you fly as the main pilot the instructions below can help you understand the duties and skills required of a balloon pilot but they cannot substitute for real experience a full balloon pilot s license and training can cost thousands of dollars but you can start by volunteering to be part of a ground crew once you have on the ground training you ll only need about 10 to 15 hours of total flight training to pass the certification test although this varies by country 5 x research source check wind conditions knowing when to cancel a flight is extremely important flying in strong winds is dangerous and should not be attempted beginners should stick to the first few hours after sunrise and the first few hours before sunset when wind is usually predictable and low speed 6 x research source check for vital equipment at the least the basket should contain a fire extinguisher a first aid kit a topographic map an aviation map an altimeter and a log book to record the details of your flight check the propane tank s fuel gauge so you can be sure there s enough fuel for the flight typically about 30 gallons 114 liters per hour 7 x research source for longer flights you ll also need radio equipment and possibly electronic navigation equipment as well inflate the balloon for lift off almost all balloons require several people to get off the ground first the burner is attached to the basket frame and laid down sideways with the envelope attached and unfolded along the ground the envelope mouth is lifted open and inflated using a powerful fan for about ten minutes then heated using the burner the basket is typically held down by crew members and or tied to the ground car until the balloon is ready for lift off the basket is righted the passengers and pilot get in and the pilot releases a steady flame from the burner to lift off the ground stay alert during liftoff as the pilot you should stay alert and watch the inflating envelope and the ground crew s hold on the lines until everything is steady and proceeding as planned briefly but methodically check in all directions for all trees or other obstacles the balloon might hit on its way up once you feel the first breeze as lift off begins immediately fix your eyes at the obstacle closest to your flight path and do not look away until the balloon is safely above it 8 x research source this makes it easier to notice a deviation in direction and to react to it by rising faster know your weather phenomena prospective balloon pilots must pass a meteorology test to gain certification including a basic understanding of how temperature altitude and humidity interact and what different types of clouds can tell you about air conditions while these aren t all covered in this guide here are a couple examples of common phenomena a significant change in wind direction as you rise or fall is called wind shear and requires special focus as it can speed up or slow down your motion if strong wind shear blows out your burner s pilot light relight it and heat the balloon as soon as possible to avoid crashing if the balloon is responding more slowly to your actions or you notice air pollution trapped instead of rising you may be in an inversion where the surrounding air is hotter the higher you go compensate by increasing the amount of heat added or let off when you want to change altitude check for wind direction and speed learn how to read a weather map and use them to plan around the general wind speed and direction in different areas to test for local wind conditions below you spit or squirt shaving cream over the edge of the basket know how to navigate balloon pilots are trained to use a topographic map and altimeter to plot their course and altitude throughout the flight obtain an aviation map from your regional aviation administration and use it to stay out of the path of aircraft a gps unit magnetic compass and pair of binoculars are also useful but not always necessary for short flights unless required by law in your area avoid turbulence or thermals if you experience any turbulence or if charts clouds or other weather phenomena lead you to expect it land as soon as you can similarly if you feel any circular motion or unexpected ascent land immediately before the rising thermal of warm air sends the balloon out of control vent air rapidly once you land out of a thermal or it could tug the basket along the ground be prepared for emergencies practice relighting the pilot light so you can do so rapidly in mid flight during an emergency if the pilot light does not relight there may be a fuel clog this requires relighting the propane above the blast valve which should be taught under experienced supervision in the worst case scenario when the envelope fabric is torn burn as much propane as possible to minimize the speed of your descent 9 x research source land the balloon it can take a surprising amount of practice to develop the ability to tell the precise direction of travel in mid flight let alone select a landing site and successfully guide the balloon to that destination 10 x research source there are several approaches and techniques you ll need to learn to land in various conditions and an experienced teacher is vital begin by practicing in best conditions with a large landing space that you can glide across at a gentle downward slope vent the air slowly and keep your eye on the tallest nearby obstacle even if it s slightly to the side once you ve cleared the obstacle you can vent as needed but aim for a steady controlled glide 11 x research source as you touch ground and prepare for a bumpy ride vent the rest of the air off to deflate the envelope congratulations you now know the basics of flying a balloon,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to board a plane,airports can be stressful so it s helpful to know how to board a plane efficiently grab your ticket id and passport if necessary get through security once through security find your gate wait for boarding to begin this usually happens 30 minutes before scheduled departure check your ticket to find your gate number if you have a gate number low numbers board first while higher numbers board last if you or someone you are traveling with is very young elderly or a veteran you may usually board first regardless of your gate number first business and priority classes always board before coach,print your boarding pass and check your luggage although many airlines allow you to check in and print your boarding pass online if you re not checking luggage you can also choose to do so in person at the airport enter the airport in the section of your airline carrier and locate their counter when you get to the front desk simply tell them your name and give them id and they should automatically print your boarding pass and ask about checked luggage 1 x research source if you have multiple flights due to layovers ask the attendant to print your boarding passes for all flights some do this automatically but it is good to ask if they don t checked luggage must typically weigh less than 50lbs and costs about 25 to start this varies from airline to airline though so check your specific airline s requirements online if you don t want to worry about checking bags you are allowed one carry on item and one personal item one that goes under the seat in front of you and one stored in the overhead bins above your seat ask the gate attendant if your bags are small enough to bring with you as carry ons if you print your boarding pass online and are not checking luggage you can bypass stopping by the airlines counter head to security if you have your boarding pass in hand and your carry on luggage prepared you can head to security have both your boarding pass out and a form of id either your driver s license or your passport it must be your passport if you re heading out of the country readily available a tsa agent will check your boarding pass to your id and then you must successfully pass through the security check all of your belongings will need to be placed in bins and sent through an x ray machine while you are being checked over in a separate machine that is able to scan the body or being examined by a wand scanner for those with known medical devices 2 x trustworthy source u s transportation security administration u s government agency responsible for ensuring safety by setting and enforcing travel protocols go to source airports are very picky about security but they will also be very vocal about it check for signs about what to do in order to successfully pass through security and if you re still not sure ask someone for help liquids and laptops must be in their own bins separate from other items any items including gum and unused gum that are found in your pockets must be placed in the bins to be scanned by the x ray also all airports will want you to place any metal objects in the bins as well and that includes metal earrings and jewelry some security checkpoints require you to remove your belt shoes and jackets look for signs to see if your airport does as well some airports may ask you to remove your socks as well but this varies a tsa agent will guide you through the process if there happens to be an issue with something in your luggage or on yourself find your gate terminal get your bags re packed and put your shoes back on so that you can go wait for your plane in the correct terminal check your boarding pass for your terminal typically a letter and your gate a number there should be plenty of signs directing you to this area but if you can t seem to locate your gate and terminal simply ask an airport or airline employee for help 3 x research source if your boarding pass does not have the terminal number and very few don t these days find a monitor with the flight schedules and check that instead hang out and wait for your plane it s always good to arrive at the airport early so that you have time before boarding the plane just in case you need it run to the bathroom grab something to eat or use your last few minutes of freedom to connect to the airport wi fi boarding the plane typically begins half an hour before takeoff so you may have plenty of time to kill be careful not to stray too far from your gate so that you don t miss an important announcement about your flight or early boarding opportunities if you want you can speak to a flight attendant at the counter of your gate about changing your seats this is the only opportunity you have to grab a different seat or to upgrade to business or first class 4 x research source wait for the announcement to board about half an hour prior to takeoff the gate attendant will announce the boarding time boarding is done in sections either by group sections designated with a letter or by rows seats check your boarding pass to see if you belong to a group and if not wait for your row or a section of rows to be called first class always boards the plane first followed by business class and people with disabilities or infants although it is not always the case it may be beneficial to try to snag a place in line early on so that there is still room in the overhead bins for your luggage otherwise if storage space runs out your bags will have to be checked get your boarding pass checked after waiting in line for boarding there will be a gate attendant next to the entrance waiting to check your boarding pass if you are flying nationally hand your boarding pass to the gate attendant who will scan your boarding pass in by placing it down on the terminal but you will not need your id out at this point if you are flying internationally you will need to show your passport again at this point keep your boarding pass out after having it checked as you may need to show it to an additional flight attendant on the plane walk down the hallway that leads up to your plane while most hallways are short there are some gates who may have line hallways much longer and curvier than others enter the aircraft there is typically a buildup of passengers after the boarding pass check so you may have to wait in line again before boarding the plane check your seat to make sure you are headed in the right direction and keep a lookout for your row number if you need help finding your seat ask others around which seats are for which row and later which seat letter is for which seat there is no one size fits all for explanations here most flight attendants are busy getting their supplies ready for your flight if you still require more help finding your seat step into an open seat near the row and once the flight attendant comes around to check on your seat belt you can ask them then 5 x research source stow your carry on items when you have located your seat place your smaller bag under your chair and look for available space in the overhead bins for your larger carry on this isn t always the easiest task so turn to a flight attendant for assistance in searching or placing your bag if necessary when you re finally able to get in your seat place your smaller carry on under the seat in front of you 6 x research source get settled in you re all done now it s time for you to sit back and relax while you are carried away to your destination in luxury during the flight you will sometimes be offered a free drink and food depending on the carrier and length of the flight if needed there are restrooms in the front and back of the plane any other questions can be directed

how to take your guitar on a plane,if you re worried about whether or not you can take your guitar on a plane or whether it would survive travelling as checked luggage don t worry it s actually your legal right to carry a guitar in the cabin of a plane with no extra fees provided that you follow some guidelines regarding size and safety in order to avoid any at gate arguments you can print out and carry sec 403 of the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 which describes how you are allowed to travel with a guitar on a plane note that there will always be exceptions such as when you re flying on a small plane that just simply doesn t have room onboard for your guitar,book a seat at the back of the plane in order to board first people at the back of the plane usually get to board first so you re less likely to have problems finding space in the overhead bins choose a seat as far back in the plane as is available when you re purchasing your ticket to make the process of storing your guitar onboard easier 1 x research source if you re purchasing an extra seat for your guitar instead of storing it in an overhead luggage compartment it doesn t matter whether the seats are towards the back or not bring your guitar as standard carry on luggage if it fits in an overhead bin sec 403 of the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 permits passengers to carry guitars and other instruments in a plane s cabin as long as it will fit in normal luggage storage bins ensure your guitar is not longer or wider than the airline s overhead bins before you travel with it if you want to carry it on at no extra cost 2 x research source you can call an airline s customer service line to verify the exact overhead bin size for your flight note that there must be space in the overhead bins at the time you board the plane or the airline can require that you check it at the gate flight attendants won t remove other luggage to make space for your guitar try to carry your guitar as discreetly as possible when you re boarding your flight to avoid getting hassled by the agents at the gate ask a flight attendant if you can store your guitar in a coat closet there are often coat closets at the front and back of a plane that flight attendants store things in politely explain to a flight attendant that you re worried about your guitar getting damaged during the flight and ask if there is any extra room in a closet to store it upright 3 x research source you can also try this option if there s no overhead room when you re boarding your flight and the gate attendants are telling you that you can t take your guitar on keep in mind that flight attendants are not required to store your guitar in a closet so if they do so they re doing you a kind favor don t fight with the flight attendants if they won t put it in a closet for you you won t achieve anything this way place your guitar carefully into an overhead bin if you can t put it in a closet head to your seat and put your guitar horizontally into the closest available overhead bin place it on top of other passengers overhead luggage if the bins are already filling up and keep an eye out to make sure nobody puts anything on top of it 4 x research source if you re having trouble fitting your guitar into partially filled luggage bins politely ask nearby passengers if you can accommodate their luggage differently in order to fit your guitar in buy a ticket for your guitar if you can t take it as carry on luggage purchase an additional ticket for an adjacent seat and take your guitar on the plane as if it s a person in the seat next to you this is the only way you re allowed to take a large guitar on a plane with you that is too big to fit in an overhead bin 5 x research source if you aren t sure whether your guitar will fit in an overhead bin this is the safest way to avoid problems when you re boarding the flight naturally this isn t always going to be realistic especially if your flight is expensive other options you can consider are getting a smaller cheaper guitar just for travel or shipping your guitar to your destination use a soft case to make your guitar fit into cabin storage more easily place your guitar in a soft gig style case to minimize its footprint for travel these types of cases don t usually add a lot of bulk so your guitar will still be able to fit into an overhead bin 6 x research source these types of cases will also make your guitar less conspicuous when you carry it on you re less likely to get hassled by a gate attendant or flight attendant while you re bringing it onboard that way if you want a little extra protection you can get a fortified gig case these are still soft but have a little more form and structure to help pad your guitar during its journey keep in mind they are also a little bulkier than totally soft cases your guitar legally must be covered in order for you to take it on a plane as carry on luggage this is required in order to prevent injury to other passengers put your guitar in a hard travel case if you have to put it in the cargo hold choose the hardest sturdiest case possible for your guitar if it s too big to put in an overhead bin and you don t want to pay for an extra seat this will provide the most protection while it s being tossed around by baggage handlers and stored in the hold with other luggage 7 x research source for example if you called your airline and found out that your guitar is too big for your flight s overhead bins or if you re flying on a small commuter plane put it in a hard case if you plan to fly with your guitar a lot invest in a heavy duty flight case these cases are expensive but they are made of very hard reinforced materials and have a lot of foam padding for maximum protection pack your guitar with paper to fill extra space and stop it from moving loosen the strings slightly and put crumpled up newspaper or packing paper in between the strings and the fretboard wrap newspaper or packing paper around the headstock neck and heel to protect them fill in any empty spaces in the case with paper as well 8 x research source you could also use soft items of clothing like t shirts instead of paper doing so can even save you a little room in your other luggage bubble wrap would also work well for this avoid putting any prohibited objects inside your guitar case with the guitar remove anything from the case that is not allowed inside a plane s cabin don t put anything in the case that you wouldn t put in a normal piece of carry on luggage to avoid problems with airport security 9 x research source for example anything sharp bottles of liquids over 3 oz 88 7 ml and lighters are things that are prohibited from plane cabins ensure the total weight of your guitar is within the airline s limit the standard cabin luggage weight limit is 165 lb 75 kg so your guitar won t be overweight for a standard commercial flight weigh your guitar in its case to make sure that it falls under the airline s weight limit if your flight has a lower limit 10 x research source you can call your airline s customer service line ahead of time or look on their website to find the exact weight restrictions for your specific flight you are probably only likely to have problems with weight if you are flying on an extremely small plane since no guitars weigh anywhere near 165 lb 75 kg,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to dress for airplane travel,let s face it nobody wants to wear their best outfit on a stuffy overcrowded airplane all most people want to wear is something comfy but chic so if you want tips on dressing to fly read on,dress with practicality in mind the airport not a catwalk airports and airplanes are full of tired holidaymakers who have no desire to look their very best you can look clean cut and fashionable without wearing your best outfit 1 x research source mix and match you could wear your comfiest maybe slightly worn bottoms and your favourite more dressy top or vice versa your whole outfit doesn t have to be high fashion but one piece could be wear a comfy outfit and dressier accessories like a fashionable carry on bag or nice jewellery 2 x research source try to think about things like going through security if you can avoid it don t wear a belt as you ll have to take it off wear shoes that are easy to take off and put back on not the ones that take ages to lace up don t wear awkward things like high heels as stepping onto the plane might be pretty tricky and you ll have less chance of escape if you have to get out in a hurry 3 x research source wearing or carrying things with offensive slogans or images isn t recommended you might not get an easy time from other passengers if you re wearing a t shirt with a racist joke or a picture of a middle finger there will be thousands of different people with different beliefs be respectful of that 4 x research source wear a tracksuit and trainers if you don t want to use these tips nobody will judge you for looking slightly sloppier than usual they ll be too busy rushing around to know or care what other passengers are wearing,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to travel by air,whether you re taking a long awaited vacation or meeting with potential clients traveling by air can sometimes be quite a hassle this is especially true in the post 9 11 world by making just a few sensible preparations before you board that plane you can be less stressed and more comfortable in fact you can even make things easier on your fellow travelers,pack what you need just like for any holiday only pack the things you need a crucial thing you should do before flying is to check the airline s baggage allowances so you get a rough idea of how much stuff you can bring if necessary buy a luggage scale to help with an accurate measurement of how much your bags will weigh 1 x research source pack for a trip bring important documents bring your visa if needed passport tickets and other documents you may need when you are on this trip be sure to bring these in your carry on or pockets not in your checked luggage the best thing to do would be to bring your important travel documents in pockets with zips as it reduces the chances of the documents falling out of the pockets and you having a very hard time explaining to security 2 x research source photocopy important documents keep one copy of your documents with you but separate from the original leave another copy to a trusted friend at home these copies will help in replacing your documents if you lose your luggage try to check in online or on your phone as this means that you have the chance to make multiple copies of boarding passes as backups and makes it a lot easier quicker and a lot less stressful when you get to the actual airport 3 x research source dress appropriately for safety and security though rare airline accidents do happen should it become necessary to evacuate the plane by using the inflatable slide or worse walking out onto the wing the last things you want to be wearing are shorts a tank top or spikey heels keep it simple cotton or other natural fiber clothing synthetics are more flammable long sleeves and pants sensible shoes preferably sneakers if you don t wear sneakers wear sturdy comfortable shoes that are easy to put on and remove for security slip on athletic or walking shoes are a good choice 4 x research source keep your footwear on at all times on the plane you ll be able to evacuate more quickly in an emergency and it s just polite keep clothing loose but warm don t wear tight clothing unless you are wearing airplane socks that specifically help with circulation many people swell during a flight due to the altitude and air compression and tight clothing may become uncomfortable air conditioning can get cold especially sitting still for so long on a long flight so long pants and top is ideal 5 x research source keep carry on items to a minimum most airlines allow only two 2 carry ons nowadays and that includes a personal item such as a purse or backpack pack necessities in your carry on this can include medications reading materials information pertinent to your trip your passport if traveling outside your home country a small travel kit in case your luggage is lost or delayed a snack and anything else you feel you can t do without such as your digital music player also choose a small carry on bag that will fit into the overhead compartment and keep the already limited foot space free 6 x research source take your own pillow and blanket long flights particularly overseas can be almost unbearable without these essential comfort items this doesn t mean you need to bring your bed pillow and your down comforter check out travel stores and websites for neck pillows and blankets that fold to the size of a dvd case you never know who might have used the airline s pillows and blankets before you or what their hygiene practices are or aren t 7 x research source bring a few health items gum may help keep your ears clear earplugs soften the drone of the engine even if you don t usually get airsick dramamine can be a lifesaver if you hit some rough turbulence 8 x research source if you have a cold or sinus problems take a decongestant well before you board the plane but bring nasal spray just in case when you are traveling overseas on a night flight sleep you will want to eat and watch the movie but when you get there it may be morning depending on where you are going and having jet lag is no fun 9 x research source to make it easier when you get to your destination on the plane instead of tuning into the time of the place you left tune into the time of your destination so you can sleep and get your body clock ready for the destination before even landing this means that when in your destination it is time to sleep you should try to sleep or at least close your eyes bring your own meal or snacks many airlines have eliminated this frill and the packed meals they provide for a charge are often pretty bad make sure you avoid liquids drinks soups etc which might not pass security inspection and are messy to deal with instead try foods like sandwiches chips cookies and cut up fruits and vegetables stay hydrated air in airplanes is often very dry you can take an empty water bottle through security and fill it once inside or you can purchase a bottled drink inside security if dry skin is a problem you may also wish to use plenty of moisturizing lotion or cream avoid consuming excessive amounts of alcohol and salt as these will dry your mouth and just add to the dry atmosphere 10 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to visit the cockpit of an airliner,are you an aviation enthusiast travelling on an intriguing new aircraft or are you just a family with an excited young child regardless many people are fascinated by the operation of airliners and this article will offer suggestions on how to visit the cockpit,if you are boarding a small off peak flight try asking the ground crew before the flight for a quick peek into the cockpit beware that this is highly unlikely and that your best bet is probably boarding or disembarkation try to ask a member of the cabin crew or cockpit while on the ground once again this may be a struggle during busy flights when boarding the aircraft have a look toward the cockpit if a member of the cabin crew or cockpit crew notices that you would like to visit the cockpit and invites you over then hooray if not continue reading if you once again miss the opportunity wait until the flight has landed try to be one of the last to disembark as you leave the jet ask a member of the cockpit crew to see the cockpit given how busy the cockpit crew are before a flight you re far more likely to be accepted after landing you re in if you do manage to be allowed into the cockpit have a chat with the pilots and ask to take pictures videos to retain this memory,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to offset the carbon footprint of flying,air travel although a relatively small industry has a very negative impact on the global environment in comparison to other modes of transportation such as cars or trains airplanes have the greatest climate impact per passenger kilometer planes produce a lot of carbon and are a major contributor to your annual carbon footprint in order to offset the carbon footprint of flying you can purchase a carbon offset although this is one way to help the environment it is not enough individuals should also actively reduce their carbon footprint as well as offset it as a result consumers should make eco friendly flying choices and reduce their annual air travel as much as possible,book with an airline that offers carbon offsets quite a few major airlines including air canada lufthansa united airlines and delta offer passengers the option to voluntarily offset the carbon footprint of flying when booking your next flight choose an airline that offers to offset carbon emissions typically these airlines will calculate the co2 emissions of your trip and then charge a fee to remove that amount of carbon from the atmosphere 1 x research source the money will be given to a third party who will either plant trees invest in energy efficiencies help to prevent deforestation etc some airlines such as united airlines will even allow customers to offset the carbon by using air miles 2 x research source use a carbon offset calculator if the airline you have chosen does not offer a voluntary carbon offset you can still offset the emissions yourself by partnering with a company that specializes in carbon offsets for example you can use a carbon offset calculator to determine your personal carbon footprint as a result of the flight the calculator will translate the co2 emissions into a dollar amount that you can then donate to a carbon offset company 3 x research source for example climatecare org will calculate co2 emissions for air travel and allow you to donate money to offset the emissions the site also offers the ability to offset your car household and business carbon footprints determine the type of offset you want to purchase there are a variety of different types of carbon offsets that you can purchase and whether you are purchasing through an airline or independently you will be given a choice in order to choose the most effective way to offset your carbon you will want to consider the type of offset 4 x research source for instance planting trees can help remove co2 from the atmosphere but they are not permanent and they do not address the global dependence on fossil fuels instead you may want to invest in renewable energy research or energy efficiencies in developing countries make sure the offset is certified with a recognizable standard such has the gold standard cdm or vcs select an eco friendly airline newer planes are often more fuel efficient and as a result newer airlines often have lower carbon emissions in order to compare the carbon emissions of different airlines use google s ita matrix software although the site was developed to find cheap flights it also provides consumers with the carbon emissions for each flight you can simply choose the airline with the lowest carbon emissions 5 x research source combine trips a great way to reduce the carbon emissions of air travel is by combining trips if you are required to go to new york city for business you could schedule multiple meetings in order to save trips alternatively if you need to go to shanghai for business you could try extending your trip and adding some personal time this way you can avoid revisiting the same place twice once for business and once for pleasure take direct flights take offs and landings use the most fuel as a result you should always take the most direct route possible when travelling by air even though you may be able to find cheaper flights with layovers you are actually increasing the carbon emissions significantly fly in economy class if you have to fly make sure that you purchase economy class tickets these seats are closer together allowing more people to fit on each flight ultimately reducing the carbon emissions per passenger this also means that you should avoid flying on private planes which only transport a few people but still burn a lot of fuel similarly you should avoid any unnecessary air travel such as a helicopter ride while on vacation find other means of transportation flying is often considered more convenient because you can travel vast distances in a fairly short period of time before you take your next flight consider if there are other modes of transportation available taking a train bus or car can reduce carbon emissions considerably and is ideal when traveling over shorter distances for example opt to take a train if you are travelling from london to paris vacation close to home one way to reduce carbon emissions is by travelling close to home many people from around the world likely vacation to an area near you look into regional destinations when planning your next vacation for example if you live in toronto try vacationing to northern ontario and take advantage of the outdoor activities available similarly if you live in san francisco vacation in the surrounding wine region use video conferences for meetings businesses can also reduce costs and consequently carbon emissions by using video conferencing for meetings rather than flying employees across the country for a meeting hold a video conference this will save the company money and will help to reduce carbon emissions video platforms such as skype and facetime can allow you to communicate with friends family and business associates as if you were in the same room drive less or carpool although this will not offset the carbon emissions of an entire flight you can take steps to reduce your carbon footprint in other areas of your life this is a great idea for people who are required to fly for instance you could drive less frequently or carpool whenever necessary one way to reduce your car based emissions would be to ask your employer if you can work from home one day each week this can help to decrease your carbon footprint and offset emissions related to flying 6 x research source use energy efficient lightbulbs install energy efficient lightbulbs throughout your household these bulbs will reduce your household carbon footprint and can help to offset the emissions associated with flying not only will you be reducing your carbon footprint but led lights can save you approximately 90 of your lighting costs 7 x research source hang dry your laundry drying clothes using a tumble drier uses a lot of energy you can reduce your carbon footprint and help to offset flights by hanging clothes to dry set up a clothes line in your yard or house and hang dry your wash for a family of four this can actually save about 153 kg of co2 per year assuming you do approximately 150 cycles of wash year 8 x research source eat local foods purchase local meats fruits and vegetables in order to help reduce your carbon footprint and offset the co2 emissions of flying instead of getting all of your groceries at a supermarket try shopping at roadside stands local butchers farmers markets or pay particular attention to food labels to ensure they are locally sourced this can significantly cut the carbon costs associated with transporting foods vast distances 9 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

know was on board a crashed flight there are some things that you will need to consider keep abreast of the news as to victims the news stories will change frequently and there may be a lot of

that your feelings are real but are not to be given free rein to make you feel worse ask yourself what is to be gained by taking on board all the sorrow do something else to distract your mind go for a walk a run visit a cafe and don t read the papers or go to the gym talk to someone else you know about your feelings make sure that it is someone who connects well with you and understands that you can be easily upset by such stories ask them to help you work through your feelings of sadness and upset if other people start talking about the crash around you excuse yourself expect some people to react badly to your voyeuristic grief if you try to voice your concerns to someone who doesn t understand that you are highly sensitive to such information or if you leave a tweet or forum post about how upset you are and someone reacts with negativity to your pain walk away from them you do not need to add other people s irritability or insensitivity to your very real feelings of sadness try not to identify so heavily with the situation the majority of planes reach their destination and flying commercial aircraft is far safer than traveling in a car if you re worried about the safety of planes and whether you ll ever catch one again keep in mind that the odds of crashing are low and the reality is that many people survive crashes but the press isn t so excited about reporting those ones seek professional help if you find that you cannot work through your upset easily you might need to learn some coping techniques for dealing with highly negative news stories to learn to separate and distance yourself from other usually unknown people s pain and loss that you re trying to take on board,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to identify an airbus a320 family aircraft,the airbus a320 family consists of short to medium range narrow body twin engine passenger jet airliners by airbus they have become icons within the aviation community for their quietness effectiveness and price they are very common in our skies however with a large amount of aircraft flying it may be hard to identify one of these birds so you may wonder how do i identify one well read on,identify the nose the most noticeable part of the a320 family is the nose the nose unlike a boeing 737 is rounded and slightly smaller than its boeing counterpart the nose can of course be found at the front of the aircraft just below the flight deck windows make sure that it is not pointed and is much rounder than surrounding aircraft it also points out in front of the main flight deck window identify the wings and winglets the wings of an a320 family aircraft are slightly curved back they start out going straight out of the fuselage however then angle back slightly towards the back of the aircraft continue by identifying the flaps there are two flaps on the back of the wings a long one and a short one they can be found by looking at the back fo the wing and extend and retract upon landing and take off there are two types of winglets of an a320 family aircraft standard winglets and sharklets the standard winglets are small and are on the end of the wing they have an arrow like shape and point at certain angles up and down sharklets are longer and bend out of the end of the wing and point up at a slight angle they are much longer than the arrow splits it is very rare however some a320 family aircraft can lack winglets of any kind however there are very few of them identify the engines the a320 family can use two main kinds of engines for the a319 a320 and a321 the aircraft uses two cfm56 turbofan engines they can be found under the wings on either side of the fuselage for the a318 and sometimes a319 two pratt whitney pw6000 engines are used when in reverse thrust the pw6000 is more noted for its flower or blooming engine spoilers there is one on all four sides of the engine and they bloom out or extend into a flower like shape identify the type of a320 family aircraft in the a320 family there are four basic types the small and discontinued a318 which is mostly used for private use the slightly bigger a319 used for passenger and private use the main size the a320 used for passenger use and is the main type of a320 family aircraft finally the a321 the elongated version of the a320 in order to identify the type of a320 look at the size of the fuselage if the fuselage is small and short it is either an a318 or a319 an a318 s fuselage is 32 meters 104 feet long while an a319 is 33 80 meters 111 feet long if the fuselage is around medium size it is most likely an a320 the fuselage of an a320 is 37 5 meters 123 feet long if the fuselage is elongated or long and thin then it is an a321 the a321 is 44 5 meters 146 feet long identify the operator there are several operators of the a320 family ranging from every continent on the planet start by finding out if the operator operates the a320 a list of operators can be found here major operators of the a320 family include the following note there are several more however these are some of the biggest british airways united airlines delta airlines easyjet all a320 fleet alaska airlines china eastern and china southern find the registration this is one of the most important parts about identifying the aircraft because the registration should tell you what the aircraft is start off by finding the registration which can typically be found on the back of the fuselage just in front of the tail once you have the registration jot it down in a notebook or on a document when you finish search up the registration online services like flightaware jetphotos or flightradar24 can help you with that identify the engines the a320neo family looks practically identical to the standard a320 family however there are some major engine differences to identify the neo family can be powered by two different kinds of engines varying to customer specifications the two kinds are the purepower pw1100g jm made by pratt and whitney and the leap 1a made by cfm international both of which are turbofan engines the purepower is larger and decently bulky it is shaped like a cylinder it may be marked as the engine varying on if the operator leaves the engine info on their livery the leap 1a is slightly smaller than the purepower and curves into a much smaller shape towards the back of the engine identify the sound the sound of an a320neo family aircraft is much quieter due to the engines record the sound of the aircraft and compare it with the sound of a regular a320 family aircraft if it is the same or slightly louder than it is probably a regular a320 aircraft if it is quieter than it probably is an a320neo family aircraft identify the operator there are a few different operators of the neo family once you have the operator jot it down for research later as stated there are quite a few operators of the neo family and a list can be found here they can include the following but not limited to spirit airlines air china easyjet air india identify the registration this is simple the registration can be found on the back of the plane right in front of the tale make sure to jot it down and then research it as stated above you can simply look it up online or use one of the services provided above,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

the type of plane is evident there are still many other elements worth noting including country of origin age and any special modifications things to note as an aircraft spotter include 4 x research source noting the type of plane its make size colors and country of origin can all be of interest noting the plane s registration details this might enable you to discern the delivery or launch dates of the particular aircraft depending how much detail you want to go into noting any interesting artwork or insignia features on a plane for example some airlines like qantas paint the tail wing or the whole aircraft using special artwork from renowned artists on certain planes for military aircraft camouflage markings are important and these will differ from country to country there might also be squadron badges and code letters noting engine noise vapor trails placement of wings is it a monoplane biplane or triplane how are the wings placed in relation to the fuselage and how much do they sweep rearwards is it a recent aircraft or a vintage model noting whether it has retractable wheels or a fixed undercarriage or is it a seaplane noting the speed noting cockpit placement noting the landing or take off pattern of the plane get some good gear here is your excuse to indulge in good quality gear guaranteed to enhance your aircraft spotting experience some items to consider include decent binoculars for checking out incoming aircraft angles for noting registration numbers marks and details for outdoing your mate at seeing things first good binoculars are a must you can also purchase a spotting scope instead of binoculars if preferred digital camera plus telescope lens tripod etc for photographic records of the aircraft you have spotted this is especially important if you are keeping a personal digital album record of your spots or if you re contributing your spots to a website fold up chair thermos flask snack container rug and warm clothing if cold sunscreen and hat if hot snacks and drinks it s important to be comfortable and to keep well hydrated and fed manuals or guides if you want to work out what the aircraft is you will need to consider both commercial aircraft manuals or guides and military aircraft manuals or guides unless you re not likely to see military aircraft in which case only commercial aircraft manuals will be needed ask at your local library or look online some online auction sites can be a good source of such manuals or sites dedicated to aircraft spotting a dedicated notebook and decent all weather pens for writing down the information you glean from spotting a weatherproof notebook available from camping stores is a good idea a safety jacket while not essential if you are able to spot somewhere that could potential be hazardous for you if you re not seen consider getting a safety jacket this might be useful even if your only hazardous element is crossing a very busy main road to get to your spotter s paradise take a buddy it s a lot more fun if you re doing this with someone you know and who appreciates your enthusiasm for aircraft spotting too if you have a buddy both of you can chat and set up your own spotting competitions between you take walkie talkies and sit in different locations to see who can spot the registration first award yourself points with the winner or loser shouting a meal or drink after the day s spotting depending on how you like to play it prepare yourself for an aircraft spotting trip initially it is a good idea to team up with somebody who has already done aircraft spotting so that they can take you to the best places and give you pointers throughout the session if not look online or ask around to find suitable places to go aircraft spotting some airports or aviation associations are very helpful and suggest spotting places for enthusiasts 5 x research source always consider safety first don t go where you re not allowed there are strict rules about getting too close to airports even if they re not fenced off on the whole those rules are for your own safety but they re also about security particularly in more security conscious countries set up your spotting area with consideration for existing spotters if you are somewhere used traditionally for spotting it s probably not wise to just assume it s ok to sit just anywhere ask for advice from the other spotters and they ll usually be very happy to make suggestions for you start spotting if you ve already worked out from the previous steps what you re looking for then start observing for those elements as you re spotting otherwise you might to ease yourself into the aircraft spotting experience by simply observing everything initially and deciding from this experience which elements interest you most this is why it can be helpful to have someone already well versed in spotting nearby to give you hints and guidance so that you don t feel overwhelmed by the initial spotting experience record your experiences once back at home while on your outing you will be taking notes and photos which will need sorting once back home plan to set aside some time to tidy up collate and reference your findings this might include selecting the best aircraft photos for uploading to a website noting significant features or things of interest that you saw during the aircraft spotting exercise tallying up the aircraft spotted marking down the aircraft you ve not spotted before as well as making notes of aircraft you still would like to be able to check off in the future decide how far you want to take your new hobby there are many possibilities and some of them may be more appealing than others for starters it is a good idea to consider how you feel about the following ideas as forming a part of your hobby or not as the case may be competing with other aircraft spotters this can include joining a club or association and aiming to spot all types of aircraft in a class that is determined by the club or association creating your own website and uploading your photos of spots onto it along with commentary uploading your photos of spots onto one of the many aircraft spotting websites already online this can be a combination of competition and hobby if wished or just serve as a source of displaying your photos as wished if you do this be sure to keep note of the date time and place of your spot as many sites record the last spot of each aircraft as a way of keeping track of the aircraft for all interested viewers joining spotting mail lists there are a number of these that you can join to be kept informed 6 x research source there are now also twitter accounts you can follow to keep up with spotting information 7 x research source for example see the twitter page for nycaviation find out if your local club or association or your favorite aircraft spotting websites have twitter accounts that you can follow broadening your hobby to include what are ancillary activities such as listening to air traffic transmissions this can be done using radio scanners but only where it is legal to do so packing your bags and getting on a plane to go and spot more planes somewhere else in the world if you have spent time cultivating friendships with other aircraft spotting enthusiasts around the world this can be a fun and exciting way to make holiday plans and to

how to identify a boeing from an airbus,boeing and airbus are the two largest aircraft manufacturers their aircraft used worldwide is the backbone of the aviation industry however if you ever come across an airplane at the airport you might have some trouble identifying if it s an airbus or a boeing in this wikihow you will learn some easy techniques to tell them apart,look at the cockpit windows the cockpit windows are easy ways to identify whether an aircraft is a boeing or an airbus take a look at the side of the windows especially the angle of the last window pane 1 x research source check to see if the side point of the conjoining of the last two window panes are angular if the conjoining angles of the two side windows are wide and less square it is probably a boeing check if the side of the last window pane has a sharp angle if the window pane has a right angle 90º or is close to a right angle at its intersection with the body of the aircraft it s probably an airbus look at the nose of the airplane the nose or the tip of the airplane is another good sign to see if an airplane is boeing or airbus 2 x research source check to see if the nose of the airplane is sharp and not round boeings have sharper and more pointy noses compared to an airbus so if the nose of the aircraft is sharp it s probably a boeing check to see if the nose of the airplane is round if the nose is round and resembles a semi circle it is probably an airbus look at the engines engines of boeing and airbus greatly differ from each other their size and shape are very different and is a telltale sign to identify whether a plane is boeing or airbus 3 x research source check to see if the engines have a flat bottom boeing engines tend to have a very flat bottom and a more circular top check to see if the engines are circular all the way airbus engines have a very circular engine almost a perfect circle look at the placement of the engines on their aircraft boeing and airbus engines are placed differently 4 x research source check to see if the engines are mounted forward a boeing s engine is placed at the front of the wing not in the middle or under check to see if the engines are mounted under the wing an airbus s engine is placed fully under the wing so the engine is more visible if you sit closer to the rear of the plane look if the tail or the fin at the back of the plane has a slope when it reaches the plane s body 5 x research source check to see if the tail of the plane reaches the plane s body with an extended slope if the tail of the plane reaches the plane with an extension causing the tail to connect with the plane less sharply it is probably a boeing check to see if the tail of the plane connects with the plane sharply this means that the tail reaches the plane s body with no extended slop if it doesn t have a slope it is an airbus look at the back gear retraction of the airplane this is difficult to examine since this only works when a plane is taking off check to see if the back gears do not have a compartment and are visible from under the plane boeing back gears retract into the plane but are not covered up check to see if the back gears retract into a compartment an airbus s gear retracts into the plane and is soon covered up so the gear is not visible after they retract take a look at the cockpit if possible although this might not be permitted it is sometimes possible to take a look at the cockpit check to see if the airplane has a control column also know as a yoke a yoke is similar to a u shaped steering wheel located at the front center of both seats in the cockpit 6 x research source check to see if a plane has a control column if the plane doesn t have a control column it is most likely an airbus take a look at the right side of the right seat or the left side of the left seat to see if there is a sidestick a sidestick looks very similar to a joystick look at the design of the emergency exits there is a major difference between the way boeing s emergency exits are designed and an airbus s design check the handle of the emergency exit if the airplane s emergency exits have a big spinning latch it is probably a boeing check the handle of the emergency exit if the plane s emergency exits don t have a big handle but a vertical push handle it is probably an airbus take a look at the space inside of the cockpit if possible boeing and airbus cockpits differ in their size 7 x research source examine the space between the captain s and first officer s seat a boeing tends to have less space between the two seats as well as the overall space in the cockpit examine the space between the captain s and first officer s seat an airbus has a greater amount of space between the seats and their cockpits are more spacious than a boeing s estimate if your airplane is a boeing or an airbus depending on your location this is only a way to make a prediction since your location does not say for sure the type of aircraft you are on boeing tends to be much more popular in north america and some parts of asia while airbus tends to be more popular in europe and some parts of asia,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

but many airlines do a visual assessment looking at weight in proportion to height in the 1960s flight attendants were required to be females of a certain weight and to retire before they reached a certain age some airlines continued these discriminatory practices through the 1980s and 1990s now men can be flight attendants there is no numerical weight requirement and people may continue working

how to become an alaska bush pilot,to be employed as a pilot for any alaska air taxi operator regulated by federal aviation regulations part 135 almost all of them you would need to have at least a commercial pilot single engine land license with an instrument rating 1 x research source most alaska air taxi companies are authorized to fly under visual flight rules vfr only but most company policies dictate having an instrument rating a single engine seaplane rating is good but unless you have a minimum of 200 hours on floats you wouldn t be hired to fly float planes there is a possible

originally posted by the office of the chief counsel faa cross country flight time is defined as time acquired during a flight that includes a point of landing that is at least a straight line distance of more than 50 nautical miles from the original point of departure not the original point of any flight leg there is no requirement that any specific leg must be 50 nm moreover a cross country flight may include several legs that are less than a straight line distance of more than 50 nm from the original point of departure nevertheless at least one leg of the cross country flight

procedures for dealing with in flight emergencies 1 x research source 2 x research source you should expect to participate in a range of educational situations that will challenge you in different ways some example topics include medical emergency response first aid this will likely involve a combination of in class and hands on training you will need to know what to do if a passenger needs assistance of this kind during a flight airplane evacuation procedures some cabin simulators are built with large pools next to them so water landing and evacuation procedures can be practiced this kind of training will be all hands on and will require that you perform the actual duties you would for the real event theory of flight and plane aerodynamics since this is a theory based subject you will probably learn about it in the classroom without much physical demonstration this is the kind of learning you would expect in a more traditional educational setting you could also be expected to demonstrate how you would handle an unexpected situation in a cabin simulator with several other flight attendants and involving actors playing passengers these training exercises are intended to test your problem solving and group interaction abilities show up on time if you are late to your flight attendant training sessions you will feel distracted and unprepared for class this will also be distracting to your fellow trainees and the instructor punctuality is a top requirement of flight attendants on the job so it s best to get in the habit of being early or on time now your training program serves the additional purpose of being an extended interview you will be constantly judged on everything you say and do during training and you need to be able to impress your instructors you are almost guaranteed to not be hired if you can t be punctual you are sure to perform better and absorb the material more effectively if you are in your seat or at your assigned location as the case may be and ready to learn when class begins get to know your trainers and classmates becoming acquainted with your trainers at the start of the program will ensure that they know you by name and will make you feel more comfortable with the training process since you will be interacting so closely with your classmates for so long up to 2 months you have the opportunity to initiate long term friendships or at a minimum form study groups to help you pass your training exam s if your training is not being held near where you live you will be staying in a hotel and probably rooming with another flight attendant trainee you will have lots of opportunities to get to know your roommate well and it is in your best interest to be friendly and courteous toward her training is a grueling and stressful process you should remain open to the idea of bonding with your fellow trainees and supporting each other throughout the program flight attending is a people oriented career you should get into the habit of being friendly and talkative with people you meet since you will have to do this in your daily line of work take lots of notes on everything you will be given a lot of information during training much of which you will have to commit to memory for your flight attendant exam at the end of the program be sure to take notes on everything you can even during your practical hands on training sessions so you can study them again later much of what you learn will not be available in written format for you to read at another time so don t count on that possibility be sure to have extra notepads and writing utensils with you while in class training you wouldn t want to run out in the middle of the day and have to ask someone else to borrow some your preparedness will also be judged heavily by your instructors taking good notes does not mean writing down every word your instructor says focus on understanding what you are being told and taking notes that will allow you to remember the key points you ll especially want to make note of any specific safety protocols you will be expected to know or at least where they can be found in detailed written form find time to relax and exercise flight attendant training days can be long up to 12 hours so it is important to focus on other things or nothing at all every now and then even though you will need to devote almost all your free time to training and studying you should not forget to take breaks when possible 3 x research source late night laps in the hotel pool 10 minute tv breaks or early morning jogs workouts can be very effective at recharging your mind and relieving stress 4 x trustworthy source harvard medical school harvard medical school s educational site for the public go to source you are likely to study more effectively if you don t try to slog through 4 straight hours of reviewing notes take a break every hour or two even if it s only for a few minutes to relax or do something else since your training involves carrying out procedures as well as knowing airline policies and regulations mix up your study sessions so you alternate between book note learning and going through the motions of more physical tasks enlist your roommate or other fellow trainees to help motivate you to balance your studies with leisure activities once in a while if you make a plan to go for a run with a classmate in the morning you re more likely to keep the appointment than if you have no one else to hold you accountable study in the morning training days will be long and exhausting and your brain will likely be fried by the time you get back to your hotel each evening don t try to study when you are tired you won t learn much and will only wake up feeling groggy the next morning especially if you sacrifice sleep this will be especially problematic if you are surprised with a quiz on something you learned earlier in the week go to bed early enough to wake up a few hours before training begins use this time in the morning to review your notes from the day before while your mind is rested this strategy will help you retain the information as well as possible if you have a hard time waking up early you can find an alternative study time that works for you just keep in mind that late night studying carries the risk of making you tired for your next day of training don t bank on your ability to use days off to catch up on studying depending on your training program you may be required to participate in weekend ride alongs or demonstrations that could take all day quiz yourself often you will have to commit a lot of information to memory such as federal aviation regulations far and potentially hundreds of airport codes 5 x research source you should get in the habit of creating quizzes for yourself in order to test your comprehension and retention of the material you are learning you may find it helpful to do this with a fellow trainee flashcards are a great way to memorize lots of information and are especially useful when studying without a partner create flashcards for terms and their definitions airport codes or any other short bits of information you need to know make a note of the topics or definitions you have trouble remembering and set aside extra time to focus on these this is a great benefit of quizzing yourself you will identify your areas of weakness before being officially tested on them match your studying to the exam format airlines differ as to the style of the training program s final exam your exam could include written and oral components and might even involve simulated flight scenarios in any case the final exam passing requirement is usually set very high around 90 some airlines will not allow you to retake the final exam so you will have to pass it on the first try do not fail to study for your final exam because a few small mistakes could end up making your training essentially worthless if you do not know the format of the final examination find an appropriate time and situation to ask one of your instructors they may choose to keep this information secret in which case you should prepare yourself for all possible exam formats if your exam will involve a simulated flight practical you will find it especially useful to study with a group this way your study partners can play other roles in the scenario such as an unruly passenger and evaluate your performance you will have a broad range of topics to know for your exam many of which are required in order for the training program to be federal aviation administration faa certified these topics will likely include cpr and first aid aerodynamics and theory of flight air traffic control principles airplane evacuation procedures faa emergency protocols in flight announcements helping disabled passengers and many more 6 x research source choose a study location free from distractions unless you are studying with a group pick a spot in your hotel such as a meeting room or business center if this is an option where you are unlikely to be disturbed if you study in your room make sure you are not watching tv talking to your roommate using your phone etc while you are supposed to be focusing on your work if you have trouble focusing at your hotel go to a coffee shop or other public place nearby 7 x research source if you have trouble reading with noise make sure you go somewhere quiet to do your reading if you choose to study away from your hotel pick a location that is easy to get to and that has hours of operation that will accommodate your schedule feel free to switch up your study locations if need be some nights studying in your hotel room might work fine but on others perhaps there is too much going on it can also be nice to get a change of scenery now and then understand that training does not guarantee you a position even if you are accepted to and pass a training program for a specific airline you are not guaranteed a position with that airline this is a preliminary step in the process of securing a job as a flight attendant 8 x research source if you sign a contract of conditional employment when you are accepted into an airline s flight attendant training program then you are guaranteed a position if you pass your training course if you wish you can take a course on general airline procedures from an outside company before applying to an airline training program to improve your chance of success these courses cover general procedures that apply to all airlines and airports this may include airport codes airline terminology federal aviation administration faa regulations first aid and cpr these classes are not a substitute for airline specific training programs plan to devote 4 to 8 weeks to training the exact duration of your training will depend on the airline but most are over a month long and very intense training programs are conducted on location so you will have live away from home for its duration unless you happen to already live near the training facility you will stay in a hotel paid for by the airline and which is also likely to provide breakfasts and dinners at no cost to you training days are very long up to 12 hours so don t expect to have much free time during training although you will have days off you will probably want to use that time to study some airlines pay their trainees but this is uncommon it is safer to expect to receive no income during training study before training begins your potential employer will send you a packet with lots of information a few weeks prior to the start of training this packet might include a list of things you need to already know by the time you start training typically training will be 95 procedures and safety here are a few things you should plan to learn or at least introduce yourself to before training airport codes you may be tested on your knowledge of these as soon as your very first day of training and you ll need to know a lot of them quiz yourself on them often until you have committed a large portion of them to memory your airline s dress code most airlines have extremely specific rules about flight attendant attire you should plan to know what you can and can t wear as a flight attendant and dress accordingly during training your airline s grooming guidelines this can include anything from makeup dos and don ts to required and prohibited hairstyles to facial hair rules for men which are most likely that you can t have any accept that company specific training is required although there are many good flight attendant training programs out there that are not affiliated with an airline this alone is not sufficient to secure a flight attendant job with an airline if you complete a general training program on your own time be aware that you will have to repeat the process with your new employer if you are selected 9 x research source think of generalized training as a good way to boost your likelihood of doing well in your next training course by doing this you won t be going into the second class without any experience or knowledge however don t expect this to be an advantage in getting selected for training in the first place airline training programs are only good for a specific type of aircraft if you are hired by your airline and later assigned to different aircraft you will have to undergo training for that specific type of plane if you train or have experience for one company in a specific plane and later switch airlines you will have to re train even if you ll be working on the exact same model of aircraft arrive at training well prepared be sure to consider what you might need during your several week training program in order to make your training period as comfortable and stress free as possible you will likely be away from home for the entire training period so a little planning will go a long way although you may get a list of suggested items to bring to training in your introductory packet it may not be totally comprehensive bring plenty of school supplies such as notebooks paper spare writing utensils a book bag etc although flight attendant training can be unconventional in some ways you are still a student and you will need to study like one plan for the climate you are traveling to your training may be held in a place very different from your hometown so consider the typical weather there during the time of year you will be training if you are from las vegas and your training is in chicago in december you ll need to prepare for much colder wetter weather than you are used to consider your comfort during training although you will be limited by the airline company in terms of how you are allowed to dress do not bring clothing or shoes that you can t be comfortable in for 12 hours at a time,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to become an alaska bush pilot,to be employed as a pilot for any alaska air taxi operator regulated by federal aviation regulations part 135 almost all of them you would need to have at least a commercial pilot single engine land license with an instrument rating 1 x research source most alaska air taxi companies are authorized to fly under visual flight rules vfr only but most company policies dictate having an instrument rating a single engine seaplane rating is good but unless you have a minimum of 200 hours on floats you wouldn t be hired to fly float planes there is a possible way around this 200 hour requirement and that is to find a job with a company that operates on both wheels and floats after flying the company wheel planes for a while and pretty much proving yourself in several ways i e good judgment work ethic winning personality excellent customer relations etc and of course stick and rudder skills they might start you flying floats on an insurance waiver until you have met the time required by their insurance company,log 500 hours of flight time to fly as pilot in command under fars part 135 requires a minimum of 500 hours of flight time of that 500 hours 100 hours has to be cross country time and of that 100 hours 25 hours has to be night cross country time 2 x research source how does the faa define cross country time the explanation below was originally posted by the office of the chief counsel faa cross country flight time is defined as time acquired during a flight that includes a point of landing that is at least a straight line distance of more than 50 nautical miles from the original point of departure not the original point of any flight leg there is no requirement that any specific leg must be 50 nm moreover a cross country flight may include several legs that are less than a straight line distance of more than 50 nm from the original point of departure nevertheless at least one leg of the cross country flight however long by itself must include a point of landing that is at least a straight line distance of more than 50 nm from the original point of departure 3 x research source in other words each cross country flight used to meet the aeronautical experience requirements under 14 cfr 61 1 b 3 must include one leg that includes a landing that is at least a straight line distance of more than 50 nm from the original point of departure 4 x research source be aware that different companies have different requirements the reality is that there are some alaska operators who will hire a pilot with just the part 135 minimums of 500 hours but most alaska operators require 1000 hours or more in a new hire many of them also prefer to see some alaska time or equivalent i e mountain time and or pacific northwest time for the most part insurance companies are responsible for these pilot employment requirements build time by giving flight instruction if you re a low time commercial pilot and want to build flight hours toward an eventual alaska flying job the best way is to give flight instruction there are several flight schools in alaska a couple of them specialize in bush flying techniques the others are geared toward gaining the desired licenses and ratings with cfi or cfi i certification you could land a job with an alaska flight school this is a great way to build up some alaska time if you decide to acquire cfi or cfi i certification from an alaska based flight school there is the possibility that the school would hire you to give flight instruction teaching at an anchorage based flight school might be the best route toward your getting a regular flying job the reason being that the anchorage area has the biggest aviation community in the state and you would get to know people who would be in a position to help you find that job when you have logged enough flight time you would also learn a bunch more than you already know by giving instruction and as you got to know more fellow aviators you might also learn a lot about which companies are really cool to work for and which ones may not be so cool start your first alaska flying job in bethel the town of bethel is one of the alaska locations where pilots new to alaska obtain their first flying job there is a fairly high turnover of pilots in bethel because it is not an ideal place to live for most pilots nevertheless bethel is the main aviation hub for more than 50 eskimo villages within the greater yukon kuskokwim delta area 5 x research source flying out of bethel is busier during the winter months than in the summer and is consequently a year round job most of the flights in and out of bethel are not tourism related but primarily provide mail cargo delivery and transportation for villagers travelling to and from other villages during the summer months many villagers are employed in other parts of alaska i e commercial fishing mining operations and other alaska industries take the additional actions necessary if you re a foreign pilot pilots from countries other than the usa would be required to have federal aviation administration faa commercial license and a work visa to be legally employed as a pilot in alaska or anywhere else in the us under current faa regulations a jaa pilot license of any level private commercial or atp will convert only to a faa private pilot certificate to convert a jaa commercial license or atp license to the equivalent faa license requires passing faa written oral and practical test 6 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source begin a serious job search with face to face interviews and trim your cover letter and resume to one page when the time comes to begin a serious job search the most effective way is face to face meetings with chief pilots owners or directors of operations whoever does the hiring of pilots in a face to face interview for an alaska flying job you should dress neatly but not in a suit and tie this would require a trip to alaska if you re living elsewhere and would require some careful planning to optimize your time and expense anchorage or fairbanks would be the best places for launching a face to face job hunt if you are unable to plan a trip to alaska then the next best method is by sending out cover letters and resumes a one page cover letter should be tailored specifically to each company you re contacting if possible it should include words indicating that you know quite a lot about the company be prepared for interviews by doing your homework first company websites are good sources of information your one page only resume can be more generic but you might consider tailoring your objective to each individual company 7 x research source do some research on effective resume writing 8 x research source alaska air taxi operators are mostly interested in your flying experience and in any previous employment as a pilot so unless you think it is truly relevant to a prospective employer your previous work history that is not related to flying is best excluded or at

how to fly a cessna 310,now that you have mastered the single engine aircraft it s time to advance and get your multi engine rating the following steps should provide enough information to help you pass your multiengine exam flight test and get your multiengine certificate these steps provide a realistic and achievable guide this article focuses on taking you through all the basics of the instruments in a cessna 310 one of the most common light twin aircraft to be illustrative of all similar types of aircraft if you would rather begin by flying the cessna 172 single engine plane visit fly a cessna,learn the differences between the cessna 172 and the cessna 310 the obvious difference is not just that the 310 has more controls to operate the engines it also has many more features in all parts of the aircraft covered later a first glance inside the cockpit at the 310 panel will reveal many more instruments and controls and more modern ones get to know the additional instruments added to the 310 instrument panel two tachometers two manifold pressure gauges two sets of engine temperature and pressure gauges notice the center pedestal with dual controls become familiar with the added controls in the 310 the most noticeable difference for this article is in the dual control pedestal the controls from left to right are two throttles two propeller controls two fuel mixture controls two fuel tank controls under the pedestal learn the twin panel differences this panel has the newer glass panel which has all the instrumentation of the six pack panel but concentrated into one glass panel in a different format where airspeed and altitude are in vertical bar displays note that three round gauges below the glass panel were kept for backup in case of glass panel failure airspeed indicator artificial horizon altimeter remember the three critical speeds there are a few more critical speeds to worry about in a twin memorize these speeds you are sure to be asked about them in the oral test these speeds vary with each aircraft check in the manual of your aircraft vmc 93 knots minimum control speed the airspeed below which the aircraft cannot be controlled in flight with one engine out vyse 106 knots best rate of climb the speed giving the best climb on one engine vxse 95 knots best angle of climb the speed giving the best climb to clear a 50 feet 15 2 m airport departure obstacle on one engine understand the faa multiengine rating requirements some of the faa requirements are as follows have your instructor show you the current list you must currently hold at least a single engine pilot s certificate must have a minimum of 10 hours of flight time with an faa qualified flight instructor in a twin engine aircraft must have made at least 5 take offs and landings in the last 90 days in a twin sufficient training to master flight with one engine shut down ground training in performing a more complicated pre flight walk around know all the special speed and other requirements with operation on both engines and with one engine off pass an oral exam with an faa inspector in all the items above pass a flight check with an faa inspector demonstrating all of the above become familiar with the walk around the walk around is more complex on a twin the following is an example of most check items use the checklist from your aircraft manual remove all control locks internal and external if installed check condition of elevator rudder trim tabs hinge bolts and actuator rods check static pressure holes for obstruction check baggage compartment and door check ailerons in same manor as elevator check main and auxiliary fuel tank filler caps are secure check landing gear for damage check engine oil minimum 9 us quarts 9 000 ml full 12 quarts drain some fuel from strainer and check for water or contamination check main landing gear tire and gear door secure check propeller and spinner for nicks or scratches check oil filler cap check cowl doors secure check nose gear check pitot tube for obstruction check taxi light be sure to perform the same checks both sides of aircraft remove tie downs perform before takeoff checklist use your aircraft check list landing gear switch in down position before turning power on elevator and aileron trimmed for takeoff check throttle friction knobs for proper friction set mixture to full rich prop controls to full forward set flaps at recommend position some use 10 degrees check your manual do not confuse flap switch with landing gear switch fuel selector valves set to main tank carburetor heat to cold full forward check fuel gauges for sufficient fuel boost pumps on controls free and movement correct cowl flaps open check your fuel the following procedures are just an approximation of what to expect your instructor may show you but not as an exact procedure for following without an instructor check all 4 fuel gauges for full tank if appropriate the 310 has 4 fuel tanks two 50 gal wing tip tanks and two 15 gallon 56 8 l aux tanks giving you a possible range of 1000 miles the total fuel weight is 1170 lbs so beware of over loading the aircraft you may have to leave some fuel behind start engines if in a clear area follow your aircraft manual start the left engine first since the battery is located there start the right engine check both engine instruments in the green altimeter set to field elevation gyros set doors and windows properly locked seat belts on including passengers no passengers allowed until getting your multiengine certificate perform engine run up a 310 run ups will be the same as a complex single engine run up per engine check magnetos carburetor heat prop controls per your 310 aircraft manual calculate the start stop runway required before taking off from any airport in any aircraft calculate the required runway length for your aircraft fully loaded see your aircraft manual with a multiengine aircraft you have to check not only the required runway length but the start stop distance for your aircraft start stop distance is the distance required for this aircraft to accelerate at full speed to vmc then bring the aircraft to a full stop on the runway the distance should be approximately 2400 feet of runway in the average 310 some pilots like to double this number to 5000 feet and use that as the minimum runway for this aircraft single engine service ceiling of a later model turbo 310 is approximately 17000 ft but an early model 310 is only about 7700 ft check your manual and memorize your maximum service ceiling best not to land at an airport elevation above 7000 ft if you have an early model 310 start your takeoff roll apply both mixture controls to maximum or as stated in your manual apply both propeller controls to maximum or as stated in your manual apply both throttle controls to maximum or as stated in your manual stay on runway centerline with rudder as required verify max propeller to be at least 2600 rpm or as per manual check engine gauges are in the green as required watch airspeed for vmc velocity minimum control do not rotate until vmc 96knots or as required establish best rate of climb if you need to clear a 50 ft obstacle use best angle of climb maintain best rate of climb 106 knots establish stabilized climb at 106 knots verify rate at least 500 fpm vertical climb indicator once positive climb is established gear up ease flaps up if any flap used maintain climb at 25 inches manifold pressure at 2400 rpm until reaching desired altitude level off at cruise altitude lower nose slightly and reduce power throttle to 23 inches manifold pressure set prop control to 2300 rpm for best cruise power of 65 power maintain this power setting and hold altitude with small adjustments of yoke and throttle trim as desired to maintain cruise altitude demonstrate engine out recovery you ll be tested by an faa inspector on engine out recognition and recovery have your instructor walk you through engine out procedures first at a safe altitude the instructor will show you how to tell which engine failed and how to fly the aircraft on one engine the instructor may kill one engine when you least expect it you ll have to demonstrate your ability to perform the following procedures recognize the loss of one engine the cockpit will suddenly get a little quieter and the aircraft will yaw in the direction of the dead engine this is more difficult at night practice this at a safe altitude and at night try using a needle ball it may help by showing the sudden change of yaw determine which engine is out first verify the throttles are both on full power both prop controls in full forward and mixtures in full rich some pilots use the dead foot dead engine procedure meaning if the left engine failed you ll have to push a lot of right rudder to fly straight if the left foot isn t needed then the left engine must be dead some say that s simple the prop will stop and the rpm will drop well in actuality the prop continues to spin at the same rpm a windmilling prop has the same drag as a solid disk of the same diameter so you need to get the prop feathered and stopped immediately add full power to the good engine now that you ve identified the dead engine verify full power is applied to the good engine feather the bad engine reduce the drag from the bad engine prop by putting the prop into the feather position prop control all the way back feathering puts the prop edgeways to the wind to eliminate drag and stop the prop from rotating you don t need the extreme drag of a windmilling prop which will cause the aircraft to be un controllable setup the aircraft for the flight on one engine get the aircraft flying straight ahead with no loss of altitude try to maintain straight ahead flight raising the dead engine side wing higher to balance out the good engine power and dead engine drag and yaw conditions always practice dead engine procedures at a safe altitude always hold the dead engine wing high until landing but only if you really have a dead engine prepare for the latest in aviation safety ads b or automatic dependent surveillance broadcast is a cornerstone of next generation air traffic modernization mandated soon by the faa for all aircraft operating in airspace that now requires a mode c transponder must be equipped with ads b this new system when properly installed and operated will allow the pilot to see and be seen and avoid all other aircraft in the vicinity in addition to aircraft traffic in flight services and weather information can also be sent

how to land a cessna 172,impress your friends on your aviation knowledge landing a plane is the most important part of a flight fly safe these instructions assume you are approaching a towered airport for landing in a left traffic pattern and the winds are calm and visibility is good,get the atis automatic terminal information service make sure you tell the control tower what happened if it is an emergency 10 miles 16 km out from entry into the airspace 1 x research source atis will give you a code such as information alpha to give to tower contact the control tower or approach control for that airport and state the following tower approach name aircraft tail number location altitude landing with information whatever atis code you received above the tower will give you instructions this guide assumes they instructed you to take left or right traffic for runway x and to report on 45 45 degree downwind entry to runway being used this is a rough guideline it s missing some specific information that tower sometimes asks for do your pre landing check with your checklist brakes checked undercarriage down locked mixture fully rich fuel selector on both flaps as required propeller pitch fixed suction indicating oil temps and press ts ps in green master on mags on both carb heat to hot if rpm is below 1500rpm hatches harness locked and latched landing lights on plane clear to land 2 x research source apply carb heat and make your descent to where you reach pattern altitude for that airport by the time you reach the 45 entry leg you can be a little higher on the 45 let s assume the pattern altitude is 1 200 feet 365 8 m msl try to descend at 500 feet per minute that will be easier on your ear drums reach the 45 and contact the tower and tell them how many miles you are out on the 45 and your altitude the tower might clear you to land or will acknowledge remember that when you reach 1 4 mile 0 4 km from the runway turn downwind 3 x research source by now the tower should have cleared you to land you should have slowed the plane to 80 to 85 knots and powered the engine to around 2000 rpms know that when you are abeam the downwind runway numbers turn on your carburetor heat on power back to 1500 rpm hold the nose level until the airspeed drops into the white arc then extend 10 degrees of flaps pitch for 75 knots using outside visual reference then confirm with the airspeed indicator make sure you coordinate your turns with the rudder pedals be especially careful not to use excessive inside rudder however skid stall spin when the threshold of the runway is 45 behind you turn left base and apply another 10 degrees of flaps this should bring your airspeed down to 70 knots do not add flaps while in the turn only after turn is complete you are now perpendicular to the runway be especially careful not to overshoot your final turn at an airport with parallel runways because the parallel runway might have landing traffic 4 x research source turn final when the field is made you would reach it even if the engine were to quit extend the next 10 degrees of flaps again after the turn is complete the spot on the ground where you will land will appear stationary use pitch to maintain approach speed usually 60 70kias use power to control altitude be careful to keep airspeed above 60kias but do not fixate on the airspeed indicator use the ailerons to correct for any crosswind and the rudder pedals to keep the plane aligned with the runway center line when you are a few feet off the ground gently power back and level off keeping level will require increasing amounts of back pressure on the yoke and increasing amounts of aileron in a crosswind after touchdown keep the yoke pulled all the way back and to whichever side is needed for crosswind only apply the brakes if necessary for field length or to avoid holding up other landing traffic continue on the runway centerline until you reach taxi speed a fast walking pace then turn off at the nearest taxiway and do not stop until you have passed the hold short line 5 x research source complete your post landing checks then call tower if they have not called you already 6 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to fly a cessna,this article focuses on taking you through all of the basics for the six instruments in a cessna 172 one of the most common aircraft the cessna 172 is illustrative of all similar types of aircraft moreover if needed you will be able to understand the more complex glass panel instruments and controls of newer and larger aircraft the framework for piloting an airplane consists of learning the most used instruments and controls becoming familiar with communication and navigation performing the pre flight procedure obtaining clearance and taking off in flight maneuvering obtaining clearance and landing mastering the below steps will take you a long way to passing your pilot s ground school exam flight test and getting your pilot s certificate,study a cessna 172 aircraft instrument panel it is a standard aircraft panel with six round basic flight instruments often called the six pack these are the ones in the center directly in front of the pilot s seat 1 x research source familiarize yourself with the six pack the six instruments are located on the instrument panel in the following order 2 x research source top left the airspeed indicator shows aircraft airspeed usually in knots a knot is one nautical mile per hour about 1 15 mph or 1 85km hr top center the artificial horizon shows the aircraft attitude and whether the plane is climbing or descending as well as whether it is in a bank to the left or to the right top right the altimeter shows the height altitude of the aircraft in feet msl feet above mean or average sea level lower left the turn and bank indicator is a dual instrument which tells what angle of bank you are in during a turn rate of turn and also whether you are in co ordinated flight and feeling the proper down in the seat g force from the turn this is also called the turn and slip indicator or needle ball lower center the heading indicator shows the aircraft s current compass heading this instrument needs to be calibrated on a regular schedule lower right the vertical speed indicator tells how fast the aircraft is climbing or descending note the two round instruments directly to the right of the six pack are dual vor vhf omni directional range instruments and to the right of them are two identical vor radios used for communications and vor navigation study the aircraft controls the necessary controls for flying this plane are 3 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source throttle a black knob when pushed forward the engine speed increases and when pulled back the engine speed decreases full back is idle speed 4 x research source fuel mixture a red knob pushed full inward is the richest mixture used for sea level takeoffs and landings full back will shut the engine off only pull the red knob fully out when you are on the ground and ready to shut down the engine 5 x research source carburetor heat used to warm the engine air intake in icing conditions notably on long descents with the engine at low power or idling conditions which result in a cold engine paired cold air which often cause icing 6 x research source note for all practical purposes this has to be either full on or full off flaps a flat handled switch used to select the wing flap positions flaps are usually deployed to slow the aircraft to a safe speed in preparation for landing note that the flaps should be advanced notch by notch one position 10 at a time fuel tank select a cessna 172 will almost always be set on both tanks yoke steering wheel this sets the attitude climb and turn and the speed of the aircraft use small pitch adjustments in and out for pitch to climb or descend turn the yoke left and right to bank the aircraft rudder pedals these are operated by your feet press the top edge of the pedals and the brakes are applied pressing the lower part of the pedals allows steering while on the runway control trim there are two trim wheels in the panel one trims the aileron and the other trims the rudder thereby reducing the control pressure required to operate the respective controls trimming allows you to more easily maintain your direction of flight take care not to over trim when landing as you may then not have enough pitch control to gain altitude quickly in case of a go around aborted landing learn the instruments and controls sit in the aircraft and spend time there just studying each instrument 7 x research source quiz yourself on each of the instruments you should be able find and name each instrument at a glance even in a darkened cockpit environment and also describe the information you get from each instrument look at the gauges and see if you can describe the instrument and know how you would use its readings to adjust your flight path it is highly recommended that you spend enough time in the aircraft to be comfortable with all of the instruments and feel like you have them mastered become familiar with the communication equipment purchase an aviation sectional chart before you begin purchase the chart at your local airport online or at a pilot s store then study the chart carefully find your local airport taking particular note of your airport s required communication and navigation frequencies find a radio manual and set up the radios at the required frequencies to communicate with the following order is an example for most cross country flights atis automatic terminal information system airport ground control airport tower airport departure control flight service stations atc air traffic control airport approach control the aviation emergency frequency commit the emergency frequency to memory but do not test it listen to these frequencies if you re not yet a pilot don t talk on them however if you are a new student you can tune in to the ground control frequency and ask ground control for a radio check alternatively your flight instructor will provide you with this information make sure to ask questions about anything you are unsure of practice changing between frequencies you should practice switching among the frequencies you need to use at your airport until this becomes second nature and you can switch and tune frequencies easily and naturally learn the vor vhf omni directional range 8 x research source vor a dual navigation system that will guide you from your departure to your destination accurately and reliably vor navigation is most important in ifr approaches but is no longer the only option when visibility is poor gps has been taking the place of vor in some aspects like vfr flights and even ils type approaches look at your sectional chart for your local airport and or nearby vor stations if you have the vor manual you should be able to listen to the vors and even test your vor instruments for accuracy by viewing them on the aircraft panel alternatively your instructor will show you how to set up the vor instruments and provide you with the required vor frequencies practice setting up your local airport vor frequency while you re on the ground some day it might be handy when you have to return to your airport after takeoff because you suddenly encounter poor visibility most airports have a vor test spot on the field called compass rose refer to airport diagram below taxi over to the compass rose test area and turn on the vors in your aircraft your vors should each be within 4 degrees of the required heading depending on where you intend to fly however you will need to master the gps learn the gps global positioning system 9 x research source gps is a navigation system that will guide you from departure to destination accurately and reliably now that gps systems have waas wide area augmentation system making gps as accurate as vor ils systems 10 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source most aircraft now have gps and some experienced pilots even a carry on handheld gps these hand helds not legal for guiding the aircraft but it still comes in handy from time to time turn on the gps and you ll see a display similar to your car gps however the aircraft version is such that you ll probably have to spend many hours to become really good at programming and interpreting the gps display and this should be your goal learn the adf automatic direction finder 11 x research source the adf system is a great backup system that will show you where you are using a system that seeks out any local adf ground station or any public am radio signal and points to the signal source if you turn and fly the direction the needle points it will take you directly to the ground station you will know when you fly over the station the needle will switch 180 degrees and point directly behind the aircraft this system makes an accurate and simple navigation aide become familiar with the transponder the transponder is a panel mounted instrument for sending your aircraft position and altitude to atc so they can track your aircraft for safety to you and to other aircraft 12 x research source atc may ask you to turn on your transponder and set it to send squawk 1200 pronounced squawk one two zero zero 1200 is the code for just a general vfr flight cruising around or in a practice area for instance if you should have a radio failure in flight squawk 7600 pronounced seven six zero zero so atc will know your problem atc will give you a code to enter into your transponder based on the type of flight you ll be making study the manual on this transponder and learn all the other modes of operation there are get to know the dme distance measurement equipment 13 x research source accurately measures and displays in nautical miles the straight line distance to your destination this is most useful in landing approaches learn the marker beacon system marker beacons are a three light radio beacon system 14 x research source this gives you a flashing light on your panel with a beeping sound when your aircraft is exactly over each of the markers showing your exact positions in the final approach to an airport the three markers are called outer marker middle marker and inner marker placed in three spaced positions down the centerline of the ils instrument landing system this system is designed to not waste any time of the pilot having to look for the instrument prepare for the latest in navigation safety ads b or automatic dependent surveillance broadcast is a cornerstone of next generation air traffic modernization 15 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source mandated soon by the faa for all aircraft operating in airspace that now requires a mode c transponder must be equipped with ads b this new system when properly installed and operated will allow the pilot to see and be seen and avoid all other aircraft in the vicinity in addition to aircraft traffic in flight services and weather information can also be supplied to the pilot perform the pre flight inspection before taking off it is important to perform a walk around examination this is a visual inspection of the aircraft to verify that the airplane components are in good working order your instructor should provide you with a more detailed and highly useful operating checklist not just for the walkaround but for all the specific airplane procedures that cover the other phases of flight 16 x research source complete a thorough walkaround follow the pre flight check list in the aircraft manual or one obtained from your instructor the most important required items will be listed in the pre flight checklist some are 17 x research source check control surfaces remove any control locks and make sure your ailerons flaps and rudder are moving freely and smoothly visually check your fuel tanks and oil make sure they re filled to the specified levels to check the fuel level you ll need a clean fuel measuring rod to check oil there s a dipstick in the engine compartment check for fuel contaminants this is done by draining a small amount of fuel into a special glass container and looking for water or dirt in the fuel your instructor should show you how if not ask look for nicks dings and any other type of body damage these small imperfections might inhibit your aircraft s flying ability especially if the prop is compromised always check props before an engine start and make sure to use caution around airplane props if there are electrical issues with the plane the prop could turn over unexpectedly causing severe injury fill out a weight and balance sheet calculating a weight and balance helps ensure that you are not flying outside the capabilities of your airplane 18 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source if you need to complete the weight and balance sheet because you have additional weight in the aircraft your instructor will show you how if it s just you and your instructor in the aircraft and you verify that there is no extra weight in the aircraft you normally won t have to complete a weight and balance sheet prepare the aircraft for flight work with your instructor to prepare the cockpit for flight your instructor will show you how to get the aircraft prepared there is a lengthy procedure to get the aircraft cockpit area set up and ready for starting the engine take your time work through this procedure and be sure not to miss anything the following procedures are just an approximation of what your instructor will ask you to perform this will show you what to expect but follow the directions of your instructor get clearance to taxi once the aircraft is set up and running turn on your strobe lights 19 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source you can now get clearance to taxi out any time you re in motion turn on your taxi lights also call ground control and ask for clearance to taxi out 20 x research source specify the runway and direction for example request a south departure on runway 20r pronounced two zero right or whatever direction and runway you prefer for departure listen to the clearance and write it down all pilots are required to read back all clearances to ground or any instructions given in all phases of flight follow the route given to you exactly as stated do not cross any runways until you re specifically told to do so by ground control always stop and ask if you re not sure if your stopping for an engine run up let ground control know perform the engine run up as described in your aircraft manual or by your instructor contact ground and request clearance to continue taxiing to the assigned runway continue taxi to the runway hold position sign and stop there do not let your aircraft be on or over any part of the hold position markings get the control tower instructions for takeoff if tower says line up and wait which means line up behind any aircraft ahead of you if no aircraft are in front of you then you may enter the runway but hold there for the final cleared for takeoff order from tower then read that back the command to line up and wait and the hold position sign are the most critical instructions in aviation and need to be completely understood by all pilots if in doubt stop and ask when on a runway always turn on strobe lights landing lights and nav lights 21 x research source then apply power and go after checking for any other aircraft on final approach or an aircraft or vehicle on the runway start your take off run 22 x research source push the fuel mixture knob fully inward and advance the throttle to full throttle as the aircraft gains speed it will pull to the left and you will have to add a little right rudder to stay on the runway center line pull gently back on the yoke when your speed reaches 55 knots this will cause the aircraft to slowly lift off the runway when the aircraft reaches 70 to 80 knots maintain that speed throughout the climb keep the wings level and showing only a few degrees of climb at the same time continue holding back on the yoke as needed to maintain 70 to 80 knots the required climb speed for a cessna 172 make the exit turn at about 500 ft 150m of altitude make your required exit turn most airports have a requirement of making a 45 turn to exit the airport area or you may request a straight out departure stay in coordinated flight by using the needle ball turn coordinator this gauge has a little airplane with a level line and a black ball that rolls back and forth along the line keep the black ball in the center by adjusting the rudder so your turns feel smooth coordinated pilots say step on the ball to know which rudder pedal to step on to center the ball and maintain a coordinated turn note that the ailerons control the bank angle and work in conjunction with the rudder when turning coordinate the rudder and ailerons by keeping the turn and bank ball centered maintain steady flight level out and setup cruise flight at this point departure control may ask you to turn on your transponder and set it to send squawk 1200 pronounced squawk one two zero zero the transponder is a panel mounted instrument for sending your aircraft position and altitude to atc so they can track your aircraft for safety to you and to other aircraft maintain your speed every airplane has an engine power setting optimized for the cruise phase of flight once you ve reached your desired altitude cruise power should be set between 2100 rpm and 2900 rpm the faa requires that all pilots must maintain an altitude at least 500ft above the highest object within 2000 feet horizontal in other words keep at about 1000ft agl at all times 23 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source at this point some pilots setup the automatic pilot and relax but most would prefer to fly the aircraft in any case the auto pilot is a very valuable instrument and will come in handy many times may even save lives so take time to study and learn how it works for future needs 24 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source if you choose to not use the auto pilot use vertical trim to maintain your desired altitude to fly you will seldom need to use aileron turn trim in this aircraft but verify that the aileron trim is set to zero get clearance to land using the communication radio 25 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source an essential part of flying is staying in touch with atc air traffic control approach control and tower in that order during approach and landing procedures you can find the correct frequencies on your sectional chart or on an approach chart as shown above atc may inform you of air traffic in your area faa s aim airman information manual requires that you respond by saying traffic in sight if you see the traffic or no contact if you don t be sure to respond promptly the tower will tell you something like report entering downwind for runway 25l pronounced two five left so set up your aircraft so you will approach runway 25l at the expected 45 degree angle so that you will enter the airport area about 500 ft 150m above the runway if given clearance to land runway 30 pronounced three zero that will always be a straight in approach see airport chart above the runway numbers refer to the compass heading of the runway the letters r l refer to the left and right runways when there are parallel runways as shown above there is a procedure called lahso land and hold short this requires you at some airport runways to land but hold short at the lahso sign at the runway crossing point ahead if you feel you can t handle this procedure tell tower and get another runway the above airport has such a procedure refer also to aviation phonetics chart below memorize this chart you will need to know them at all times that you are pic pilot in command reduce your airspeed to do this reduce power by backing off on the throttle but do not deploy the flaps yet only lower the flaps when you reach your entry point again do not lower the flaps when airspeed is excessive do so only when the airspeed is within the white arc on the airspeed instrument 26 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source stabilize the airspeed and rate of descent with a combination of yoke power and flaps down maintain your speed at 80 knots with a descent rate of 500 ft min 150m min until you reach about 1000 ft agl you may reduce the throttle to idle now if you prefer or later in the landing as long as you maintain your speed at 60 to 70 knots and hold that speed until you reach about 10 ft 3m above the runway you ll learn this with practice verify throttle at idle and raise the nose slowly by pulling back on the yoke try to hold the aircraft at a couple feet off the runway until the two main wheels touch down continue holding the nose wheel off the ground it will settle to the ground safer by itself apply some judicious braking once the nose wheel has touched down this will slow the aircraft for safely exiting the runway never stop on a runway unless told to by tower or ground control exit as quickly as possible using the off ramp specified by the tower you ll see runway boundary markings on the taxiway in front of you taxi quickly over this line to a point where the tail of your aircraft has also crossed the lines at this point stop and call ground control for permission to taxi to the parking area read back the instructions as always and follow the instructions back to the parking spot practice handling night approaches runway approaches at night show you a lot of helpful indicators about the runway approach area for safety reasons the row of lights across the runway end are called rail runway alignment indicator lights 27 x research source note also that the runway markings and side lights are white taxiway lights however are always blue learn and memorize aviation phonetics practice these phonetics you will need them constantly and at a moment s notice atc and all other aviation flight service stations will always use these phonetics don t make up your own study runway signs runway signs are very important all pilots need to learn what they mean 29 x trustworthy source

how to prepare to fly an airplane in an emergency,in the event that the pilot has a medical emergency the following steps should provide enough information to help you get the aircraft safely to the nearest airport these steps provide a realistic and achievable guide provided you keep two things in mind it will not be easy so preparation ahead of time is essential you will have to concentrate 100 on flying the plane and leave the pilot s medical condition alone job 1 is getting the plane on the ground safely newer aircraft have a very elaborate glass panel instrument system but that will not be covered in detail by this article if needed you will be able to understand the more complex glass panel instruments and controls by becoming intimately familiar with the basic six instruments in a cessna 172 one of the most common aircraft,study a cessna 172 aircraft instrument panel it is a standard aircraft panel with six round basic flight instruments sometimes called the six pack these are the ones in the center directly in front of the pilot s seat note too that some aircraft will also have a set of instruments and controls in the co pilot position familiarize yourself with the six pack the six instruments will be located in the following order top left the airspeed indicator shows aircraft airspeed usually in knots a knot is one nautical mile per hour about 1 15 mph or 1 85km hr top center the artificial horizon shows the aircraft attitude that is how the plane is inclined in all directions whether the plane is climbing or descending and how it is banking left or right top right the altimeter shows the height altitude of the aircraft in feet msl feet above mean or average sea level lower left the turn and bank indicator is a dual instrument which tells how fast you are changing the compass heading rate of turn and also whether you are in co ordinated flight feeling the proper down in the seat gs from the turn this is also called the turn and slip indicator or needle ball lower center is the heading indicator which shows the current compass heading keep in mind that small amounts of friction in the heading gyro dictate that this instrument be calibrated on an ongoing basis this is explained below in the calibration procedure lower right is the vertical speed indicator which tells how fast you are going higher or lower it gives the rate of descent or climb in feet per minute zero means that you are maintaining altitude and are neither climbing nor descending test your knowledge of the six pack using the 172 panel photograph above can you tell by reading the six pack panel instruments what the aircraft s current situation is your answer should have been the aircraft is in a slightly climbing left turn cruising at a speed of 110 knots about 3 100 feet 944 9 m above sea level on a heading of 178 almost due south study the the aircraft controls the necessary controls for this mission will be as follows throttle a black knob when pushed forward the engine is at full throttle and when pulled full back the engine is idling fuel mixture a red knob pushed full inward is the richest mixture used for sea level takeoffs and landings while full back is engine off only pull the red knob full out when you are on the ground and ready to shut down the engine carburetor heat used to warm the engine air intake in icing conditions and on long descents with engine at idle conditions where a cold engine with cold air could cause icing note that for all practical purposes this has to be either full on or full off flaps a flat handled switch to select the wing flap positions this will be used for slowing the aircraft to a safe speed in preparation for landing the aircraft note that the flaps should be advanced notch by notch one position 10 at a time fuel tank select a cessna 172 would almost always be set on both tanks steering wheel yoke this sets the attitude climb and turn and the speed of the aircraft use small pitch adjustments in and out for pitch to climb or descend turn the yoke left and right to bank the aircraft engine rpm is used for setting engine speed power for climbing descending and or landing rudder pedals these are operated by your feet press the top edge of the pedals and the brakes are applied of course this only has an effect when you are on the ground pressing the lower part of the pedals allows steering while on the runway and helps do quality turns in the air you will also use the lower part of the rudder pedals to stay lined up with the runway while on final approach control trim there are two trim wheels in the panel which when adjusted properly give you almost hands off control you will not be using these in an emergency be aware too if you do try to use them to trim for landing you may not have enough pitch control to gain altitude quickly in case of a go around you would have to re trim in case of a go around but it is way better to just stay away from these controls and consider them off limits become familiar with the navigation and communication equipment the radio or nav com equipment is used to navigate the plane and importantly to talk to the tower or atc air traffic control in an emergency call them as soon as you get the aircraft under control get someone to show you how to set or change radio frequency in order to communicate with atc the airport tower changing frequency may not be necessary but you should know how to do this and should take the time to practice before you are in an emergency situation so that you will not get hung up on this when an emergency does arise communication is a critical aspect of surviving an emergency situation there is little chance that you will be able to land safely without the tower and their guidance ask your pilot for the emergency frequency commit the emergency frequency to memory just in case you may need it practice changing frequencies work until this becomes second nature and you can switch and tune frequencies easily and naturally know when not to change frequencies if you are already talking to atc then stay on that frequency as long as you can atc will tell you when to change frequencies do not go to emergency frequency just tell atc that you are declaring an emergency they will help you get home safely do whatever they ask of you and be sure to get confirmation about anything you are not sure of before you take action learn in an actual aircraft it is best if you reinforce what you learned about the six pack and the basic controls in an actual plane preferably in a cessna 172 solidify your understanding of the instrument panel and controls while in the aircraft using a printout of the above steps see if you can point to and touch every instrument and control listed at the same time say aloud what each is used for quiz yourself on each of the instruments not only should you immediately be able to name each instrument at a glance but also describe the information you get from each instrument look at the gauges and see if you can determine the normal operating ranges then ask yourself what basic actions you would have to perform to correct for certain conditions for example if you were slightly descending and wanted to get back to level flight what would you have to do take a few moments to deeply think about the scenarios you imagine and visualize the correct action you might take this will prime your mind to absorb further lessons it is highly recommended that you spend enough time doing this to feel like you have it mastered up to this point you should at a minimum have a good feel for what information each instrument gives and how it relates to the plane position and near term flight path target and master each of the instruments and controls the airspeed indicator top left has arcs colored in green yellow white and red normal airspeed will of course be in the green and the lower edge of green indicates the flap up stall speed try your best to keep the instrument in the green arc while cruising use the yoke to adjust nose up and nose down pitch to set the airspeed do not use the throttle to adjust airspeed the red line is the never exceed speed line stay out of there the white range is safe flap lowering speed and the lower end of white is the stall speed for full flaps down only used when on final approach for landing the artificial horizon has a miniature aircraft in the center in straight and level flight it should stay there if it starts to drift use the yoke to re center and or level the small airplane on the horizon line the altimeter may start to wind or unwind if you seek to maintain level flight use the yoke to stabilize your altitude you can see that you will have to scan these six instruments to maintain control of the aircraft that s why the six are right together in front of the pilot scan them often the needle ball should stay centered when you are in level flight and turning the aircraft when turning the needle ball graphically shows you the quality of the turn you re making strive to keep your turns very shallow less than 10 this will keep you out of trouble which is what you are after whenever you fly a plane particularly for the first time and particularly in an emergency the heading indicator should be on the heading you are trying to fly if not use the yoke to make one or a series of very shallow turn s to stay on course don t chase the heading too much just make very small corrections and patiently wait for the reading to settle that will feed back on how you re doing and you can correct a bit again if needed the vertical speed also should be centered at zero in level flight if not make small pitch corrections with the yoke don t chase the rate of change of ascent or descent make one small correction same as above and continue scanning the instruments develop the mindset and habit of making only the smallest of corrections when you incorporate all of the six pack in your scan routine the scanning will get a little harder to do the small corrections procedure is the same for all changes you will perform to control the aircraft get this thoroughly in your noggin and ingrain it in your being learn how to calibrate the heading indicator it is critical to calibrate this instrument on an ongoing basis usually 3 5 times an hour if the heading indicator is off only a couple of degrees you will not arrive at the airport where you intend to land therefore it is critical to take hands on instruction in the calibration of this instrument it is normally adjusted to agree with the magnetic compass before takeoff and re adjusted periodically in flight to correct for gyro precession errors set the heading indicator only in stabilized straight and level flight learn the phases of normal flight straight and level flight climb descent work hard to understand straight level flight in this phase you use the yoke to maintain level by keeping the small airplane level and centered on the artificial horizon line during daylight hours this can be done just by looking out the windshield at the real horizon alternatively you can scan the six pack and use the feedback to maintain level in either case always make sure to look outside and to scan the six pack when possible do not rely on one or the other when both are available ensure that the rpm gauge is indicating a cruise setting of between 2100 and 2700 rpm when you are in straight and level cruise flight you can adjust the rpm using the throttle understand the mechanics of the climbing phase climbing is normally done under full throttle but if only a gradual climb is necessary you can pull back on the yoke to raise the aircraft nose about five and no more than ten degrees above the horizon while advancing the throttle slightly remember to also continually scan the six pack at all times and make very sure that nothing else is changing scanning the six pack will let you know if you start into a turn start to bank the aircraft or the airspeed starts to drop if an unwanted bank starts gently turn the yoke the other direction and if the airspeed diminishes level off for a bit and advance the throttle a little more next time you try to climb the cessna 172 can stall in a turn at approximately 65 knots no flaps so keep your turns shallow and avoid any speed below 80 knots to allow yourself a margin of safety remember to boost the speed by lowering the nose slightly and or adding a little throttle when necessary again use gentle corrections and stay well out of the danger zones that are indicated on the instruments get a good feel for what transpires during descent phase there are two scenarios one for landing at an airport that is near your current position and one for landing at one that is farther away a descent to land at a nearby airport is done by reducing the throttle to an engine speed of about 1800 to 1500 rpm while setting the air fuel mixture at full richness red knob fully inward if the descent will cause you to be a long time at low engine power then you may have to use carburetor heat to prevent icing at reduced rpms the engine will not be producing as much heat and you may have to kick on the carburetor heat do so only if the weather indicates possible icing conditions here the tower can give you guidance so ask if you aren t sure if you re descending for a landing at an airport further away reduce throttle to 2000 rpm to descend while maintaining a higher airspeed however don t get going too fast watch the airspeed indicator and avoid going very far into the yellow arc become intimately familiar with the landing phase this will be the most critical part of your maiden flight again there are two main ways to approach landing at any airport the standard traffic pattern 45 angle to the runway and the straight in lined up with the runway emergency approach we will assume that you have clearance for the emergency approach after all that is what this is an emergency practice in a high quality simulator or under the direction of a qualified flight instructor the landing phase is the hardest to do successfully ideally several landings should be practiced in a simulator or in an actual aircraft if at all possible practicing landings ahead of time is highly recommended know the appropriate conditions for a straight in approach the straight in approach is preferred in an emergency so maintain a higher altitude until you have the airport runway in sight then you can start your descent keeping the runway in sight be sure to ask for the airport with the longest runway and preferably for an airport where atc uses radar plan to be about four miles from the chosen runway at an altitude of 1 000 feet 304 8 m agl above ground level hopefully you will be in contact with tower by then and they can advise you with the aid of their radar if not then you have to make the approach yourself descend toward the 1 000 feet 304 8 m level above the runway and slow the aircraft set the throttle to 1500 rpm with a vertical descent rate of 500 feet 152 4 m per minute and an airspeed of 80 knots lower the flaps a notch at this point remember to move the flaps only one notch at a time plan on full flaps down by the time you are five miles out if your altitude is at least 1 000 ft set the throttle to idle at this point with the mixture at full richness red knob in use carburetor heat only if weather indicates possible icing conditions each time you lower the flaps a notch 10 push forward on the yoke a little to counteract the tendency of the flaps to raise the nose add more pitch down to keep your speed at 75 knots if necessary you can slowly reduce your speed to 65 or 70 knots now stabilize the plane in line with the runway at four miles out the airspeed should be 65 knots with full flaps and a descent rate of 500 feet 152 4 m per minute check to ensure the throttle is still at idle use the rudder pedals to stay in line with the runway not the yoke use the yoke only for pitch control nose up and down at this point unless there is a crosswind then you may have to use the yoke to bank slightly into the wind use only the rudder pedals to continually line up with the runway and stay on course hold that attitude and airspeed keep everything the same all the way to about three to four feet above the runway then start slowly raising the nose as the aircraft settles to the runway called the flare continue to hold the nose wheel off the runway after the main gear touch down apply brakes as soon as the nose wheel touches the runway if you re coming in a bit hot going a little too fast you can also raise the flaps to get better braking remember that the lower part of the rudder pedals help you to steer while you are on the ground while the upper parts do the braking pilots say any landing you can walk away from is a good landing nice job know how to perform an emergency go around if need be the go around is a very dangerous maneuver even for experienced pilots and is not recommended for a beginner however if at any time in your approach or landing you see or anticipate major problems where things are not lining up as planned a go around is required apply full power smoothly and increase the pitch nose up to climb make sure the carburetor heat is off and the fuel mixture is full rich do all this simultaneously while raising the flaps slowly a notch at a time re trim pitch for a climb this action helps reduce the yoke pressure hopefully you noticed the advice about considering the trim wheels off limits and heeded that advice so this step will not be needed it is only included here as a part of a complete checklist for the go round maneuver climb out at 80 knots once your airspeed reaches 80 knots do not raise the nose any further and if the airspeed drops below 80 knots lower the nose a bit to prevent a stall level off at 1 000 feet 304 8 m above ground level agl make a wide arc gently turn the aircraft in a wide circle until you are lined up on the runway still at 1 000 feet 304 8 m agl attempt the landing all over again be alert to the danger the mechanics of the human inner ear allows you to detect a change in motion or a change in velocity in any direction realize that your body senses only changes and also be aware that your mind has been trusting what the inner ear says each day of your life for a long long time this is a hard thing to break away from but it is absolutely critical to be able to ignore what your body is telling you because it may be wrong instead when you do not have supplementary visual input rely solely on the instruments switch to total reliance on the instruments once you lose your ability to see clearly once you lose the ability to determine your plane s spatial orientation by using visible cues either the horizon a beacon or a landmark you must compel yourself to rely solely on the instruments and force yourself to discard what your body is telling you understand the nature of the danger the tendency of untrained pilots is to fly by the seat of the pants and to enter the death spiral a series of actions which inevitably leads to a crash if you enter a banking turn and stay there in co ordinated flight for twenty seconds or so your body gets acclimated to the turn and thinks you are flying straight and level when you are still in a banking turn in the dark or when visibility is limited you have no visual cues to correct the impression your body has picked up the death spiral starts when you notice you are losing altitude common in banking turns and pull up on the yoke to gain altitude the problem comes from being in a banking turn pulling back on the yoke results in tightening the turn and a further loss of altitude not in gaining altitude the natural tendency is then to pull back even more on the yoke and that makes things even worse moral of the story trust the artificial horizon refer to the little plane s exact attitude within the artificial horizon before you attempt any altitude correction make sure you are in straight level flight before you make an altitude correction this will be apparent on the artificial horizon provided the heading indicator is relatively constant be highly aware that any loss of altitude might be the result of entering a banking turn without realizing it this will be evident on the artificial horizon and on your heading indicator if your heading is changing you are turning rely only on the instruments if you have little or no visibility resist the urge to fly by the seat of your pants trust your instruments try to engage the autopilot in instrument meteorological conditions imc this is your best chance for a safe landing,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to start the engine of a cessna 150,you ve finished your pre flight inspection and you re ready to start your engine however starting the engine of a cessna 150 is a little more complex compared with starting the engine of a car follow these simple steps and you ll be in the air in no time,mixture rich push the mixture knob in fully allowing maximum amount of fuel into engine carburetor heat cold push the carburetor heat knob in fully master switch on turn the master switch in the upward position 1 x research source prime as required in summer or when engine is already warm there is no need to prime if the engine is cold priming may be necessary before the engine will start to prime simply pull out of the priming knob and push it back in repeat this step two or three times as needed 2 x research source throttle open 1 4 inch 0 6 cm push the throttle in toward the control panel 1 4 of an inch 3 x research source note you may use your eye for this step it does not have to be exactly 1 4 of an inch propeller blast area clear make sure there is no one behind you before starting the engine 4 x research source ignition switch to start turn the key all the way to the right hold it in this position until the engine has fully started begin pre take off check list 5 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to execute a go around in a cessna 172,safety in flight sometime requires you to execute a go around while on final approach to landing several reasons may exist that would necessitate a go around runway incursion overshooting the touchdown point or if the tower instructs you to do so,know that when you find it necessary to go around or if the tower instructs you to go around immediately apply full power move carb heat to cold and climb as you would just after takeoff push hard on the yoke to keep the nose from rising too quickly if your flaps are fully extended you will have to exert a lot of force as you retract the first 10 degrees of flap immediately then in 10 degree increments retract the flap when you have a positive rate of climb do not retract your flaps all at once you will sink and crash fly slightly off the runway center line an offset to the right is preferred so you are able to see the runway and any aircraft that may be a hazard remain your assigned pattern until you are cleared to land follow normal landing procedures,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to refuel a cessna 175 at a self serve fuel pump,whether you are beginning the day with a flight somewhere new or just arrived at your destination you will eventually need to refuel your cessna 175 refueling an airplane is more complicated than refueling a car these instructions will walk you through the process of refueling your cessna 175 from start to finish these instructions are meant as a starting point for student pilots and should be used in addition to a licensed flight instructor s advice these instructions are intended to be performed on a cessna 175 high wing aircraft however these steps can be used for most other aircraft as well be sure to learn the refueling process specific to your aircraft,use safe taxi practices airports can be busy places you must use safe taxi practices to ensure you do not damage your plane other planes property or someone on the grounds 1 x research source airport diagram using one whether printed on paper or an ipad or similar device allows you to know where you are located on the airport correct control inputs wind can make taxing a struggle and making sure your control inputs are correct will keep your plane from being damaged the same can be same for taxiing on a soft field surface such as gravel or grass communicate with radio regardless of whether an air traffic control atc tower is present it is essential to communicate your intentions to other traffic at the airport keep a watchful eye out ensure you are not getting distracted by things in the cockpit such as talking to passengers this will keep accidents from happening line up the front edge of the wing with the fuel pump hose this will make it much easier to pull the fuel hose out and be in the best refueling position follow your aircraft s checklist for shutdown each aircraft has a different shutdown procedure be sure to follow each step of your aircraft shutdown checklist 2 x research source master switch ensure that the master switch of the aircraft is turned off magnetos take extra caution to ensure that the aircraft s magnetos in the off position and that the keys are in your pocket and not still in the airplane this will ensure that the propeller will not accidentally start place chalks on the nose wheel of the aircraft the ground at the airport is often uneven and you do not want the plane to roll away also keeping the wind from pushing the plane in any direction is necessary 3 x research source nose wheel make sure that the chalks are placed on the not wheel this will keep the plane from rotating around one wheel and getting damaged by hitting something ground the aircraft this is important because the ground cable will discharge any static electricity around the aircraft and keep any static spark from being created and igniting a fire around both your plane s fuel tanks and the giant fuel tanks 4 x research source ground wire each airport has a ground wire at its self serve fuel tanks ensure that this is connected to a metal portion of your aircraft open the fuel tank on each wing each fuel tank on the cessna 175 has a fuel tank opening using a ladder or step stool depending on which is available open both tanks 5 x research source place the ladder next to the furthest fuel tank to make your life easier leave the ladder or step stool by the furthest wing fuel tank once everything is open this will give you a much easier time when fueling begins as you will start fueling here 6 x research source pull the hose out pulling the fuel hose out before you start to fuel will make everything much less difficult pull it out past your farthest fuel tank so that you have slack in the hose when you get on the wing also make sure the hose locks so that it is not continually pulling 7 x research source follow the refueling instructions each airport has a different system for turning on the fuel pumps and paying for the gasoline each with a slightly different instruction follow the instructions on the screen for your airport s self serve fuel system 8 x research source fill the fuel tanks after payment you can start filling the tanks of your aircraft 9 x research source do not use the automatic stop these do not always work correctly and can cause a spill it can also keep you from filling up your fuel tanks fully be sure you can see the fuel level visually when filling up close both fuel tanks when your done fueling up you will want to close your airplane s fuel tanks ensure that they are correctly closed 10 x research source shut off the fuel pump once done refueling shut off the fuel pump once this is done the refueling process is done and you can collect your receipt if you had chosen to get one 11 x research source retract the hose the fuel hose that you pulled out will need to be retracted if it was not it could prevent someone from using the self serve fuel pump and possibly damage their airplane 12 x research source secure nozzle the nozzle will need to be stored so that it doesn t get contaminated with debris or other substance 13 x research source disconnect the ground wire the ground wire that is connected to your plane needs to be disconnected and stored correctly if not just like the fuel hose it could get in the way and possibly damage your aircraft or someone else s 14 x research source sump fuel tanks this is important because not all fuel is perfect it can have contamination in it such as water or other debris each fuel tank is designed to have contamination sink to the bottom portion of the tank where the sump it it is important to sump all tanks to ensure no contaminated fuel gets into the engine and causes damage or engine failure during flight 15 x research source pre flight your aircraft if you walked out of sight of your aircraft pre flight your airplane before flying again this will ensure that nothing damaged your plane during the time you were away and that everything still works 16 x research source remove the chalks remove the chalks from the aircraft s nose wheel so that when you start the engine your aircraft can move 17 x research source start the engine use your aircraft s checklist to properly start your aircraft s engine 18 x research source carefully move away from the self serve fuel tanks safely taxi your plane away from the fuel tanks watching out for the self serve tanks other planes and other people 19 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to enter and recover from a power off stall in a cessna 150,a stall is a loss of lift and increase in drag this occurs when an aircraft is flown at an angle of attack greater than the angle for maximum lift this in simple terms in when you are flying too slow and you have the nose pitched up too high and as you keep pitching the nose up and losing airspeed the wings stall when an aircraft stalls the plane starts to sink and loose altitude rapidly accompanied by the nose dropping,before performing any advanced upper air work what s known as a hasel or the 4 a s check check should always be completed h height you want to be at a safe altitude to ensure that you can recover in time by law you are supposed to have recovered by 2000 agl above ground level a area you want to be in a safe rural unpopulated location s security seat belts secure doors secure check for loose items in the baggage area e engine you want to make sure your fuel is on mixture full rich carb heat on hot gauges green l lookout do a complete lookout all around you with 180 degree turns and look above and below you to make sure there is no other traffic around you pull power smoothly to idle avoid abrupt pull back to avoid harm to engine the nose will want to drop maintain altitude and attitude by pitching back on the controls continue pitching back through the slow flight range and gradually increase back pressure while stall horns starts to sound once you get to the point of the stall the nose will drop and you will start to rapidly lose altitude you are stalled the nose of the airplane will tend to yaw quite a bit control all yaw with rudder and absolutely no aileron control ailerons always neutral slowly ease the nose down to break the stall and start gaining airspeed wait for airspeed to climb back into the green zone once airspeed is in green simultaneously regain straight and level flight and add full power climb back to original altitude trim if necessary,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to enter and recover from slow flight on a cessna 150,knowing how to control an airplane is a great thing to accomplish whether for recreational purposes or career involvement with this set of instructions an individual will learn how to control an airplane when entering and recovering in slow flight speeds,before entering slow flight the pilot needs to maintain the airplane in cruising speeds and keep the same altitude after reaching cruising speeds of about 90 kias and about 2500 rpm a hasel check is required a hassle check consists of a few steps to be safe while in flight and making sure a pilot can follow through with their intentions check for h eight a rea s ecurity e ngine l ookout including 2 clearing turns perform 1st clearing turn perform pre flight check list seatbelts shoulder harnesses fuel shut off value fuel mixture turn carb heat on progressively bring the throttle back to 1500 1700 rpm to decelerate slow flight speeds once airspeed indicator is in white arc move flaps to 10 degrees pull back on controls nose up to maintain altitude perform second clearing turn during turn move flaps to 20 degrees pull back on controls nose up to maintain altitude once wings are level move flaps to 30 degrees pull back on controls nose up to maintain altitude add power to approximately 2000 rpm whenever getting close to 55 kias or as needed to keep altitude while in flight the left hand controls the airspeed and the right hand controls the altitude movements are exaggerated e g turns rudder etc slow flight is usually around 55 kias and the slow flight signs are low airspeed unresponsive aileron and possibly stall horn to perform power off stall lower nose as if looking at a runway for landing purposes progressively begin nose up attitude flare and wait for stall to recover from stall immediately add power and pull up nose to level plane simultaneously carb heat cold and slowly incrementally return flaps to 0 degrees to recover put the nose down plane faces the ground add full power carb heat cold nose up climb back to initial altitude at 70 kias,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to do a circuit in a cessna 150,a circuit is the path an aircraft flies in the traffic pattern around an airport these instructions are for a normal circuit which is left hand so all the turns are left turns better for the pilot sitting on the left to see what he s turning towards the speeds and check list are for a cessna 150 this circuit is controlled so there is an air traffic control tower the circuit height is 1 500 feet 457 2 m asl in ottawa,get clearance to take off from tower and takeoff stay straight on runway heading climbing at 70 knots once you are at a safe height above 500 feet 152 4 m lift the left wing up to look for traffic before you make your turn turn left 90 degrees in a climbing turn with no more than 10 degrees of bank this leg is called crosswind you still should be climbing at 70 knots once you are at a 45 degree angle from the runway lift the left wing up and look for traffic turn 90 degrees in a climbing turn to the left this leg is called downwind on the downwind you should be parallel with the runway once you reach 1 500 feet 457 2 m above sea level then level out and then reduce the power to 25 rpm your airspeed will be around 90 knots once you are levelled out call air traffic control tower with the radio tell them your indent your position what runway in use if you want to land or touch and go ex ottawa tower this is alfa bravo delta tango on the downwind for runway 04 touch and go do pre landing checks ex for the cessna 150 they are fuels on mixture rich throttle set carb heat hot mags on both master on primer locked oil pressure and temperature gauges in the green brake pressure check landing light on doors and seat belts secure once you are 45 degree angle from the runway lift the left wing and look for traffic turn 90 degrees left this leg is called the base cut the power when you think you can glide to the runway with 70 knots descending from 1 500 feet 457 2 m look out the window judge when you should turn final when you think it s time lift the left wing up and turn 90 degrees to turn on to final approach line up with the runway and add power if you think you re too low to the ground once you have clearance to land or touch and go ex victor lemma mike tango cleared to land on runway 04 land or do a touch and go on the runway you are cleared for,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to perform a short field landing in a cessna 150,landing an aircraft is one of the most essential skills a pilot learns when learning how to fly landing is a difficult skill to master and to make it worse there are various forms of landing all of which a pilot needs to be proficient at these instructions will however allow the most beginner pilot to safely perform a short field land in their cessna 150 with little to no prior knowledge of how to do a short field landing,the first instruction begins after the majority of the circuit has been flown and you are on final approach to the runway the approach speed should be 70kts and you can control this speed by pitching either up to decrease speed or pitching down to increase speed next a minimum of 20 degrees of flaps needs to be lowered however if winds permit fully extend the flaps to 40 degrees a guide line to go by is if the wind is more than 15 knots only take 20 degrees of flaps if the wind is between 10 and 15 knots use 30 degrees of flaps and if the wind is less than 10 knots use 40 degrees of flaps when you are short final approximately 200 feet away from the threshold of the runway the air speed needs to be decreased to 65 knots this can be done by further decreasing power and pitching the nose of the aircraft up by pulling back on the control column the plane should be over top of the runway at this point approximately 10 to 15 feet 3 0 to 4 6 m above the ground and the rpm needs to be at 1200 plus or minus 100 the rpm is controlled by the throttle reduce the power to idle by pulling the throttle all the way out you should be approximately 3 5 feet 0 9 1 5 m above the ground and in line with the center line on the runway at this point as pulling the power to idle will decrease your height begin to flare pulling back on the control column and pitching the nose of the plane up this will cause you to lose your remaining altitude the main landing gear should touch down at this point apply full brakes the brakes are applied by pushing on the tops of the rudder pedals bring the flaps all the way up and put the carburetor heat back to cold continue to hold the control column back to minimize any vibrations congratulations you have successfully completed a short field landing in a cessna 150,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to prepare to exit a cessna 172 in the event of an emergency landing,if you plan to use an aircraft as a means of transportation it is important to know and follow all safety related information and directions particularly in a small aircraft because such safety related information may be overlooked the following sets of instructions are to be used as standard procedures in the event of an emergency landing in a cessna 172 these instructions are very similar to many other small aircraft such as a cessna 150 172 182 206 and the cessna 340 in the event of an emergency aboard one of these aircraft you can refer back to what you learned here,stay calm upon notification of a failure and the potential for a crash landing remain calm and listen to all commands given by the pilot ensure that your lap and shoulder belt if installed are tight to fasten your seat belt pull down on the end of the tether confirm the lap belt is around your hips and not your abdominal area if your aircraft is equipped with a shoulder belt secure it beside your hip and confirm that the belt runs from your hip across to your opposite shoulder make sure that your seat is in the most upright position and that it is locked in place look around you is there anything that could present a potential hazard stow or jettison any articles that could cause harm to either you or the aircraft if you are wearing eyeglasses take them off and stow them in a pocket locate your closest exit in a c172 there are two main doors one located on each side of the aircraft identify the additional emergency exits there is a cargo door located on the left side if seated in a forward facing seat of the aircraft that can be kicked out if needed both the front and back windows in a c172 are made out of plexiglas both these windows can be kicked out locate a heavy sweater or coat this item will be folded into a square and placed in front of your face for cushion just prior to touchdown open the door before you land if you are sitting in the co pilot seat the pilot will request at 200 feet 61 0 m above the ground that you open your door and lock it open do not be worried you will not be sucked out and the door will just bang against the cabin resume the brace position for the seat you are in on the final approach or approximately 100 ft above the ground clasp your hands together and hold your head in between your knees with your elbows pointing towards the floor of the aircraft note this position if for seats without shoulder belts for positions with shoulder belts simply cross your arms across your chest as if making an x and hold each shoulder with a hand maintain the brace position as the aircraft contacts the ground hold the position until the aircraft comes to a complete stop exit the aircraft you have already noted your closest exit but confirm there are no hazards outside before exiting it is extremely important that you get out of the aircraft quickly but you do not want to step out of the aircraft into fire or oil grab the medical kit and fire extinguisher on the way out if you are able bring them with you meet the other passengers at the back of the aircraft this is the meeting spot where everyone will go to confirm who s made it out and co ordinate the rescue effort move away from the aircraft call the emergency services for help turn on the elt which is normally located in the back of the aircraft simply flick the switch to the on position,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to take off in a cessna 150 and climb to cruising altitude at best rate of climb,this article aims to in a few simple steps show you how to take off in a cessna 150 and climb to a cruising altitude using best rate of climb vy this article in no way replaces the need for lessons from a certified instructor,complete all safety checks including walk around ensuring you have sufficient fuel and oil for your planned flight after your have followed the specific checklist to your aircraft taxi to the runway and hold short come to a complete stop at the yellow line check that there are no other aircraft on final approach when the way is clear make a radio call to ensure that the tower and other traffic know your intentions when you have received clearance or provided other traffic with your intentions taxi onto the runway and align with the center line apply full throttle to the aircraft push throttle all the way in ensure that the airspeed indicator comes alive by checking that it shows an increasing reading of airspeed when the aircraft reaches the targeted airspeed of 50 knots no x winds gently apply back pressure on the control column to rotate the nose gently off the runway be sure not to pull back too far and cause the aircraft to lose too much speed accelerate and maintain 65 70 knots as the aircraft gains some altitude make adjustments to the amount of back pressure applied on the control column so the airspeed indicator reads 68 knots this is the speed where the aircraft will gain the most altitude for the amount of time if the aircraft is going too slow gently lower the nose slightly until the airspeed rises to the targeted airspeed of 68knots to alleviate the need for constant back pressure on the control column in order to maintain the targeted speed you can trim the aircraft once the aircraft is stabilized into a climb at 68 knots trim the aircraft using the trim wheel to trim the aircraft so the nose points more towards the ground rotate the wheel upwards rotate the wheel downwards to raise the aircraft nose this may take some adjustment after you have trimmed the aircraft correctly it will maintain the targeted speed every 500 feet 152 4 m of altitude you gain gently lower the nose by pushing forward on the control column so that you have a good view of what s in front of you perform a lookout for any conflicting aircraft or terrain that may cause a problem to your flight once the lookout has been performed and it is safe to continue the climb allow the aircraft to bring its nose back up remember that it is still trimmed so this should take little effort from you when you have reached your desired altitude lower the nose so that the plane is no longer gaining altitude by pushing forward on the controls when the climb has stopped decrease the amount of throttle so the rpm indicator shows between 2300 2400 rpm trim the aircraft using the trim wheel so that the aircraft no longer wants to climb by itself this will most likely require you to rotate the trim wheel up so the nose of the aircraft comes down,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to rivet an 470 ad 4 4 rivets,the fuselage of an aircraft is kept together by rivets for this reason it is extremely important that when the skin is put together the mechanic has great training on how to shoot rivets one of the most common rivets that is used in aircraft maintenance is the an 470 ad 4 4 a universal head rivet with a dimple it s an important part of the maintenance process and a critical skill to learn,drill out holes with the number 40 drill head where needed always start with a small drill head to make sure the holes are more accurate gauge the holes with the drill head needed for the job in this case the number 30 will be used hold a bigger drill head with your hand and de burr which means to get rid of the excess of material and to make the hole smooth to ensure less stress this will prevent the material from cracking get the rivet gun ready make sure the head of the gun is just a little bigger than the head of the rivet find the rivet needed in this case the an 470 ad 4 4 lock the piece that is going to be riveted with the help of a clamp put the rivet on the hole and the gun at the top of the rivet with the bucking bar at the bottom making sure that the gun and the bucking bar are on a straight position press the trigger and start the riveting process any lines or bends on the rivets are unacceptable and rivets with this problem have to be removed repeat the process for every hole on the piece to remove a rivet take a drill with a number 30 drill head and drill a hole at the middle of the head of the rivet make sure not to make it too deep or it might damage the piece place a pin punch in the hole made on the head of the rivet and hit it with a ball pein hammer to avoid damaging the piece,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to navigate using a vor,vor short for vhf omni directional range is a type of radio navigation system for aircraft vors broadcast a vhf radio composite signal including the station s morse code identifier and sometimes a voice identifier and data that allows the airborne receiving equipment to derive the magnetic bearing from the station to the aircraft direction from the vor station in relation to the earth s magnetic north at the time of installation this line of position is called the radial in vor parlance pilots then use this information to determine their exact position and navigate to their destination this article assumes you already have some basic working knowledge of flying an aircraft,tune and identify tune the vor frequency in the navigation radio it will be listed on vfr and ifr charts as well as instrument approaches if it is a part of the approach identify that you have the correct station and the signal is reliable by listening to the morse code identifier 1 x research source if you see a red nav or vor flag barber pole or off instead of a to fr indication the signal is unreliable you are overhead or roughly 90º from the selected radial the signal is unreliable when you cannot hear the morse code identifier a red gs flag is not a vor indication get your bearing determine which radial you are on by turning the obs omni bearing selector knob until the cdi course deviation indicator needle is centered and you have a from indication looking at the picture above you can see that the needle is centered and the instrument gives a from indication as a small white triangle is showing and pointing down so the aircraft is on the 254 degree radial it doesn t matter what the heading of the aircraft is it is located somewhere along a line 254 from the vor station in order to fly to the vor station you would first twist the obs knob until the needle is centered and the white triangle appears next to the to designator in the opposite direction or up from the fr designator note that this will be 074 degrees exactly 180 from the current radial now turn the aircraft to this new heading and keep the needle centered this will take you to the vor station fly the direction of the desired radial you can find the direction of an airway on either a vfr or ifr chart set the radial s direction into the obs and turn the aircraft to fly that heading once established on the heading note the position of the cdi if it is to the right your radial is to the right likewise if it is left the radial is left intercept the course turn 30 degrees in the direction of the cdi to intercept the course although 30 is most common and easy to use you can use any intercept angle for instance if you are far enough from the desired course it may take more than 30 to intercept the course before reaching your destination 2 x research source track the radial as the cdi moves close to the center turn your heading to match the radial keep the needle centered to stay on the radial if the needle starts drifting left turn left to get back on course 3 x research source tracking inbound towards the station and outbound away from the station radials is exactly the same except you should get a to indication when flying inbound and a from indication when flying outbound on a radial aircraft heading opposite the direction of the radial will experience reverse sensing which is the cdi indicating right when the radial is to the left and indicating left when the radial is to the right adjust for wind if you find yourself blown off the radial by the wind note the amount of deflection then intercept the radial by turning the aircraft towards the radial twice as many degrees as the deflection when the needle centers turn only halfway back to the original heading to provide a wind correction angle wca 4 x research source tune and identify both vors just as before two vor receivers are best but you can still identify an intersection with one vor by switching the frequency and comparing the radials of both vors 5 x research source set the obs use the obs to set the correct radials from each vor the radials will be displayed on vfr and ifr charts if they are victor airways but any two intersecting radials may be used on vfr charts the arrows identifying the intersection point to the vor while the arrows on an ifr chart point from the vor toward the intersection wait for both cdi needles to center while tracking the course on one vor watch the other vor to see when the cdi centers when both needles are centered you are on the intersection if dme equipped and using a vor dme or vortac use dme to eliminate the need for a second vor while tracking the vor radial use the dme to find your distance from the station dme distances will be displayed on ifr charts when it can be used to identify an intersection for example waric intersection is defined by the 238 radial from the vor and the 21 nm dme fix,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to fly a holding pattern,if you re a frequent flyer you have probably had to hold at one time or another holding is when an airplane makes several 360 turns to avoid other aircraft or wait for a clearance to land although not as common now as it used to be you may still encounter a holding request especially if you are a pilot working on an instrument rating with that in mind the following article is written from a private pilot standpoint and foolishly assumes you know how to use aircraft navigation equipment such as vors dme and ndbs,determine the holding fix air traffic control atc will give you instructions to hold north of skier intersection as published or give you specific holding instructions such as hold south east of falcon vor on victor 366 left turns the holding fix can be identified on an instrument flying chart and will usually be an intersection of victor airways pre established flying routes between vor navigational aids a vor very high frequency omnirange station or an ndb nondirectional beacon 1 x research source visualize the holding course this is the position in relation to the holding fix that atc would like you to hold at they may say hold west on victor 8 or hold on the kremmling 260 radial you should be very familiar with vor and ndb radials and bearings before flying holding patterns the holding course is the course to fly to the station this will always be the reciprocal of the radial or bearing from the station eg the 260 radial would result in a 080 holding course to quickly identify this take a piece of paper and put a dot for the holding fix and draw a line in the direction of the radial or airway to hold on place an arrow pointing to the station to identify the holding course 2 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source draw the holding pattern once you have the fix and course mentally or physically draw a picture of the holding pattern you will need to determine if it is standard or non standard a standard pattern turns are to the right while non standard turns are to the left if the pattern is non standard it will be published on the chart as left turns or atc will say non standard pattern or left turns starting at the holding fix draw a 180 turn in the direction specified left or right continue the line paralleling the holding course and draw another 180 turn to bring you back to the holding course this is the famous racetrack or holding pattern 3 x research source determine the correct entry procedure depending on where you enter the holding pattern you will need to follow an entry procedure if you are coming from 70 to the left right for non standard patterns of the holding course use a teardrop procedure coming from 110 to the right or left if non standard use the parallel procedure and from the remaining 180 fly a direct entry the entry procedures are outlined below 4 x research source parallel procedure when approaching the holding fix from anywhere within sector a turn to a heading to parallel the holding course outbound on the non holding side for the appropriate time see step 5 turn in the direction of the holding pattern through more than 180 degrees and return to the holding fix or intercept the holding course inbound teardrop procedure when approaching the holding fix from anywhere in sector b turn outbound to a heading 30 from the holding course on the holding side for the appropriate time then turn in the direction of the holding pattern to intercept the inbound holding course direct entry procedure when approaching the holding fix from anywhere in sector c fly directly to the fix and turn to follow the holding pattern time the legs the pattern should be flown so the inbound leg is one minute long if you are flying at or below 14 000 feet 4 267 2 m mean sea level msl or one and a half minutes above 14 000 feet 4 267 2 m msl at the holding fix make a 180 standard rate turn 3 sec in the direction specified for the pattern standard or non standard when you are abeam the holding fix or after rolling out of the turn if you are unable to determine abeam the fix start timing the outbound leg after a minute 1½ minutes above 14 000ft make another 180 turn in the same direction to intercept the holding course time the inbound leg until reaching the holding fix if there is little or no wind it should be one or 1½ minutes as appropriate if not you will need to adjust the outbound leg to make the inbound leg the appropriate time for example if you are flying at 12 000 feet 3 657 6 m and find that it takes 45 seconds to fly the inbound leg after flying outbound for one minute make your outbound leg 1 minute and 15 seconds next time similarly if the inbound leg comes out as 1 minute 30 seconds shorten the outbound leg by the extra 30 seconds remember not to start timing the outbound leg until you are directly abeam the holding fix watch your speed unless otherwise depicted on a chart or directed by atc maximum holding airspeed between the minimum holding altitude and 6 000 feet 1 828 8 m is 200 knots indicated airspeed kias between 6001 and 14 000 feet 0 0 m don t fly faster than 230 kias and above 14 000 feet 4 267 2 m maximum airspeed is 265 kias adjust for wind to make the inbound leg the appropriate time if the inbound leg is shorter than it should be lengthen the outbound leg by the difference if the inbound leg is too long shorten the outbound leg by the excess time for example flying below 14 000 feet 4 267 2 m if the inbound leg takes one minute 45 seconds to complete time the outbound leg for 15 seconds one minute minus the extra 45 seconds from the inbound leg 5 x research source triple your crosswind correction on the outbound leg if you have a 10 crosswind correction to hold your track on the inbound leg fly the outbound leg with 30 correction maintain standard rate turns some holding patterns require the use of distance measuring equipment dme or gps along track distance atd the basics are the same as above except a dme distance is used as the holding fix 6 x research source enter the pattern as appropriate teardrop parallel or direct 7 x research source start the turn to the outbound leg at the specified dme atd fix end the outbound leg and turn to the inbound leg at the required distance instead of timing the leg for example if you are holding on the 10dme fix to the navaid and flying 5 mile 8 0 km legs as directed by atc you would end the outbound leg at 15 miles 24 km dme see diagram above if you are holding away from the navaid subtract the length of the legs from the holding fix for example if you are holding on the 20dme fix and flying away from the navaid end your outbound leg at 25dme 8 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to communicate with an air traffic control tower,this is a short tutorial on the basics needed in order to communicate with an airport control tower,mentally go over exactly what you will say before touching the radio and keep it in mind determine your position if you are on the ground you will need to tell the controller exactly where you are eg alpha taxiway general aviation ramp gate 5 runway 20 parking spot 2 look for the black and yellow position signs if you are in the air and approaching the airport determine the distance msl altitude and bearing east north southeast northwest etc from the field make sure you contact the tower and establish two way communications before entering class d or c airspace and obtain a clearance before entering class b airspace acquire necessary information if you are calling tower approaching the field or talking to ground control with a request to taxi you will need the current atis information if available also prepare the frequencies you will need ahead of time atis awos clearance delivery ground tower approach control departure set the next frequencies in the standby radio or write them on a paper easily accessible to you in the cockpit communicate your request in a professional and organized manner the standard format is who you re calling who you are callsign where you are and what you want for example heathrow ground cessna golf echo golf november romeo on west apron with information tango request taxi for v f r flight departing to the south read back any important information to ensure you received the correct message this includes all hold short instructions takeoff landing clearance include specific runway frequency changes ifr clearances etc for example los angeles tower mooney niner one seven victor cleared to land runway two five left remember this,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to takeoff and land on a soft runway,as a pilot you may have to land on a runway that is not paved this could be a dirt gravel or grass strip and requires a different technique than a paved runway the basic idea is to stay off the runway as much as possible most of the techniques in this article will apply to any airplane but since each plane is different it is important to be familiar with the procedures for the aircraft you will be flying for simplicity this article will focus on smaller aircraft such as a cessna skyhawk,while taxiing apply full back pressure on the yoke pull it towards you to relieve the pressure on the nose wheel keep the braking to a minimum as much as possible so you can keep your inertia depending on conditions you may want to lower your flaps to 10 at this point if you can don t stop at the hold short line only if you have permission to do so and traffic conditions allow for it always obey the controller if at a towered airport look for traffic approaching to land lower the flaps to 10 if you haven t already when all is clear radio the tower or announce your intentions on the common traffic advisory frequency ctaf ctaf is used at non towered airports or when the tower is closed once you have obtained clearance only at towered airports taxi onto the runway and align on the center line do not stop as soon as you are lined up smoothly apply full power and continue to hold the yoke back the nose will begin to rise continue to hold back pressure to keep the nose wheel off the ground the cowling should be aligned with the horizon the plane will takeoff on its own quickly but smoothly apply forward pressure to lower the nose the plane is off the ground but does not have enough lift to fly this is called ground effect it feels as if the plane is flying on a cushion of air between the wings and the ground although this is not really the case at all that feeling is caused by the ground interfering with the wingtip vortices down wash reducing overall drag and therefore increasing airplane performance if you go too high you will lose this cushion the drag will increase thus decreasing airplane performance and lift and you may crash try to keep you altitude above the runway approximately equal to your wingspan as the speed increases you will need to apply even more forward pressure on the yoke you will feel like you are flying in a nose low pitch attitude and you are once you reach a safe airspeed usually the best rate of climb also known as vy raise the nose and climb maintaining vy this information can be found in your pilot s operating handbook poh enter the pattern as you would at any airport after contacting the tower or announcing your position on the ctaf fly the standard traffic pattern beginning your descent on the downwind leg abeam the touchdown point of the runway don t forget to lower 10 of flaps when the runway is 45 over your shoulder turn base and lower another 10 of flaps turn final to align the plane with the runway and lower flaps completely 30 or 40 depending on the aircraft once you have the runway made pull the throttle to idle once you are a couple feet above the runway gently flare and add a little bit of power adding a little power at this point allows you slow your decent rate and keeps you from slamming into the ground and flipping the plane it also allows you to touch down at a slower airspeed making for a softer landing as soon as the main gear touches the runway pull the power back to idle apply full back pressure on the yoke to keep the nose wheel off the ground allow it to settle on its own holding full back pressure taxi off the runway to make room for other traffic you may need enough speed to avoid settling and getting stuck use caution,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to navigate in flight using an automatic direction finder,an automatic direction finder adf is used for exactly what it says to find the direction of not only a radio source i e a radio tower but also to use the bearings locations of two radio sources and the headings directions of travel of their signals in order to pinpoint the location of the aircraft receiving them 1 x research source an example of one type of adf indicator is the rmi radio magnetic indicator pictured in figure 1 which is the version discussed in this article an rmi consists of a magnetic compass backing with two indication needles one generally double bared or thicker and another thinner needle both of which are tuned via the adf to home into the signals being transmitted from two separate radio stations as the aircraft approaches them from the air the small orange symbol at the center along with the orange arrow aligned with it and set into the compass degrees indicate the current orientation of the aircraft in relation to the signals being received 2 x research source andrew herd flight simulation tutorial understanding approach plates october 20th 2010 by faa definition it is electronic navigation equipment that operates in the low and medium frequency bands used in conjunction with the ground based non directional beacon ndb the instrument displays the number of degrees clockwise from the nose of the aircraft to the station being received for the beginning pilot particularly those flying in aircraft without more advanced navigation systems an adf system represents a component for in flight navigation over long distances for an ame aircraft maintenance engineer particularly one specializing in an aircraft s electrical systems it is a system that leaves no room for missteps in its upkeep and repair where even the smallest of mistakes on their part could result in a margin of error literally miles wide however in both cases before either can progress to using it for themselves or to learning to maintain it the essential first step is to understand the fundamentals of how the system functions and how it is designed to be operated the following are steps in the basic operation of an rmi adf system in a typical aircraft as they would begin once lift off has been achieved and the aircraft is on a steady level flight path,begin with locating a single radio source by looking first to the adf control panel figure 2 to select the proper setting push the button labeled adf next select the radio station you wish to locate based on those selected for your flight path in your previously determined flight plan and utilize the tuning knob seen on panel in figure 2 in order to tune into that station s frequency at this point in aircraft where it is automated as it is in the majority of newer models the aircraft s loop antenna figures 3 4 contained in a casing often found on the underside of the aircraft will receive the signal being projected from the station it is tuned into and produce an audio output for the you or your navigator to hear in the form of morse code the designation for the station being received comes through as a series of short and long beeps representing the dots and dashes involved in morse code which you or your navigator must interpret with the purpose of confirming the station once this is confirmed the one interpreting the signal must look to the rmi which will at this point indicate on the compass the bearing of the station in degrees with regards to the aircraft s relative position figure 5 once the bearing is read record it on a navigation chart for further reference in order to continue on to find the aircraft s position you the pilot or your navigator must then select the frequency of a second station using the same method as with the first the setting needed to read both frequencies at the same time varies based on the system installed in a given cockpit determine the bearing of the second station the thinnest needle will remain tuned into the first frequency and the second and thickest needle on the rmi will indicate the new bearing also in degrees read the bearing then be plot it onto the navigation chart with the first with the bearings of both stations determined you must now draw straight lines from both locations to indicate the headings of the radio signals the point in which they intersect will be the location of the aircraft in flight in order to track the positioning of the aircraft throughout flight repeat the above steps in the same manner accounting for the change in frequency with each new radio station,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to pre flight an aircraft,preflighting an airplane is the process of inspecting it prior to takeoff this is a general outline of steps to assure the airworthiness of your aircraft for takeoff actual preflight requirements may vary from one type aircraft to another and these steps would not be appropriate for military or commercial aircraft,use a preflight checklist if you have one many rental or fleet aircraft have one which may have all recent service inspection and maintenance information updated for each aircraft here are some things you may see flight hours because aircraft maintenance is usually scheduled at flight hour intervals the actual hours flown are logged to accommodate scheduling service dates for these activities pilot observations when more than one pilot is likely to operate an aircraft it is beneficial to have input from each pilot as to the flight characteristics of the plane one pilot may notice a vibration shudder or other physical anomaly or unusual readouts from gauges while in flight that the next pilot should be aware of service schedule if a component airframe engine etc has a scheduled 100 hrs inspection due after 5 more flight hours a longer flight could be postponed until the service is performed or another aircraft utilized begin your preflight in the cockpit since before flying you will need to make sure all cockpit equipment is operating and the fuel tanks have sufficient fuel for your flight make sure the aircraft registration certification and other paperwork is in the cabin and up to date make sure the ignition switch is in the off position turn on the master power switch check the fuel gauges if the fuel is low call for the service truck to bring your fuel out while you continue to do the rest of your checks listen to the sounds of equipment powering on radio cooling fans instrument gyros and other equipment make noticeable sounds and when unusual sounds are heard it may be a warning an instrument or radio could fail in flight check flaps landing gear lockdown levers and other flight controllers for smooth normal function exit the aircraft as you climb out of the cabin take a look at the seat support rails on small aircraft to make sure the seat is anchored securely and all fasteners are in place check the cabin door to be sure it operates smoothly and shuts securely worn hinges or latches that do not secure properly can cause an inflight emergency if the door does not move smoothly into open and closed positions it may indicate the airframe and internal structure are damaged walk around the aircraft looking for damage cause by impacts or cracks and seams separating from airframe fatigue hard landings or other mishaps begin at the right wing after exiting the aircraft and look at the forward wing surface for nicks loose fasteners dents or other damage look at the flight control surfaces flaps and ailerons make sure that items are secure and have no loose fasteners remove the fuel cap for wing fuel tanks and visually confirm they have sufficient fuel to make your flight replace the fuel cap securely check stall indicator depending on which wing it is mounted on struts if applicable and other features on the right wing move down the right side of the aircraft continue looking at the aircraft surface be particularly careful to observe defects or loose fasteners in the aircraft surface move to the tail assembly while at the tail you may remove the wheel chock or tail tie down look at the elevators and the rudder as with all control surfaces these should be tight with no loose motion or free play look at the antennae assembly which is usually located at the tail as well as the tail wheel to be sure no lubricants or brake fluid is leaking and that the tire is properly inflated give the gear suspension a once over too making sure any boots or covers are in place and that all support cables are tight move to the opposite side of the aircraft continuing to look over the aircraft skin to the wing remove the fuel cap and look into the tank to be sure it is fueled replace the tank cap securely and check out the control surfaces again the ailerons and flaps move to the front of the aircraft and look at the exhaust looking for oil blow out and other damage check the engine oil the ignition wires magneto electrical connections and the fuel lines and other hoses to be sure they are seated properly and tightly clamped look at the alternator belt to make sure it is tight and the air intake to be sure it is not obstructed move to the propeller never place your body in the swing radius of an airplane propeller check the spinner for lubricant leaks missing bolts and pins or other problems look at the propeller itself to be sure the blades are not cracked bent delaminated or damaged in other ways check for fuel or lubricant leaks around the engine compartment cowling and fuel tank locations any leaks or appearance of fluid on the aircraft skin should be inspected by a trained maintenance person prior to flight take a look at the wheels landing gear and landing gear compartment doors look for loose fittings tires which may have tread separation low inflation pressure and other defects remove the wing tie downs and wheel chocks walk to the front of the aircraft and take a long careful look to make sure you have not overlooked anything,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to takeoff and land on a short runway,not every pilot has the luxury of a 3 mile 4 8 km long runway of course depending on the plane you re flying short is relative however the technique required to takeoff or land on a short runway is similar for many airplanes for simplicity this article will mainly focus on smaller aircraft such as a cessna skyhawk,obtain takeoff clearance from the tower or announce your intentions on the common traffic advisory frequency ctaf taxi onto the runway and align the plane with the center line taxi as close to the takeoff end of the runway as this allows you to use all the length of the runway with some very short runways it may be helpful to start acceleration at the hold short line of the runway thus arriving speed at takeoff end of the runway with ten or fifteen knots of airspeed already developed if acceleration from the hold short line is not possible taxi to the takeoff end apply your toe brakes and leave the flaps in 0 position smoothly apply full power and release the brakes once the rpm is in the green arc keep the plane centered with the rudder pedals by the point of time you reach about 20 below rotation speed set the flaps to the takeoff position once rotation speed is reached gently pull back on the yoke this speed called vr can be found in the pilot s operating handbook poh if the density altitude and gross weight are both climb at the best angle of climb speed vx which can also be found in the poh this speed will give you the most climb over distance only until energy airspeed bleeds off at that point you must reduce the angle to maintain the vx speed that is in the poh enter the pattern as you would at any airport after contacting the tower or announcing your position on the ctaf fly the standard traffic pattern beginning your descent on the downwind leg abeam the touchdown point of the runway don t forget to lower 10 of flaps when the runway is 45 over your shoulder turn base and lower another 10 of flaps turn final to align the plane with the runway and lower flaps completely 30 or 40 depending on the aircraft don t forget to lower your gear if your aircraft has a retractable undercarriage fly the approach using a point just before the threshold as your reference maintain awareness for power lines trees fences or other obstructions with short field techniques use power to maintain glide slope and elevator to maintain a speed that will not allow this point to appear to speed up or slow down a couple feet before the edge of the runway pull the power back to idle and gently flare to lose airspeed and touch down on the numbers raise the flaps and apply maximum braking without locking the wheels apply full back pressure on the yoke to keep the weight on the main gear exit the runway to make room for other aircraft traffic,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to take off in flightgear in a boeing 777,the boeing 777 200er is one of the airplanes that comes with flightgear when you download it first it is also the most complete here s how to start up and take off,put the arm rests down check that fuel payload is correct on the overhead panel make sure that the apu is running and the left and right bus cross feeds are on set the transponder to standby make sure the altimeter is set to 0 check that the left and right engines are clear turn the parking brake on set the thrust levers to idle as far back as they will go looking back up at the overhead panel turn on the left right and centre fuel pumps there are two switches for each fuel pump turn on the left and right engine cut off switches on the overhead panel again turn the power generator cross feeds on and turn the apu off taxi to the runway set the flaps to 20 turn the parking brake off on the overhead panel turn the nav lights and strobe light on turn the cabin lights off ctrl l set the speed brakes to auto and set the auto brake to rto get clearance for take off set thrust levers to 75 when above 110kts rotate when in a positive climb retract the landing gear climb to about 4 000 feet 1 219 2 m then retract the flaps,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to survive a plane crash,the chances of dying on a commercial airline flight are actually as low as 9 million to 1 that said a lot can go wrong at 33 000 feet 10 058 4 m above the ground and if you re unlucky enough to be aboard when something does the decisions you make could mean the difference between life and death almost 95 of airplane crashes have survivors so even if the worst does happen your odds aren t as bad as you might think you can learn to prepare for each flight safety stay calm during the crash itself and survive the aftermath,dress comfortably you ll need to be able to stay warm if you survive a crash even if that is not a consideration the more of your body is covered during impact the less likely you are to receive serious injuries or burns wear long pants a long sleeve t shirt and sturdy comfortable lace up shoes 1 x research source loose or elaborate clothing poses a risk as it can get snagged on obstacles in the close confines of a plane if you know you re going to be flying over cold areas dress appropriately and consider keeping a jacket on your lap cotton or wool clothing is also preferable as it is less flammable wool is preferable to cotton when flying over water as wool does not lose its insulating properties to the degree cotton does when wet wear sensible shoes although you may want to be comfortable or professional looking on a flight sandals or high heels make it hard to move quickly should there be an emergency high heels are not allowed on the evacuation slides and you can cut your feet and toes on glass or get flammable liquids on or in your sandals if you wear them 2 x research source sit in the tail of the aircraft passengers in the tail of the aircraft have 40 higher survival rates than those in the first few rows in the event of a crash because a quick escape gives you the best chance for survival it s best to get seats as close as possible to an exit on the aisle and in the back of the plane 3 x research source yes it s actually statistically safer to fly economy than first class save money and stay safer read the safety card and listen to the pre flight safety speech yes you may have heard it all before and you ll probably never need it but if you keep your headphones on during the pre flight instructions or ignore the safety card you ll be missing out on information that could be vital in the event of a crash don t assume you know it all already either every type of airplane has different safety instructions 4 x research source if you re sitting in an exit row study the door and make sure you know how to open it if you need to in normal circumstances the flight attendant will open the door but if they are dead or injured you ll need to do it count the number of seats between your seat and the exit row find the exit closest to you and count the number of seats that it ll take to get to it if the plane crashes it could be smoky loud or confusing in the cabin afterward if you need to escape you might have to feel your way to the exit which will be a lot easier if you know where it is and how far you might even write down the number in pen on your hand so you ll have a quick reference if you need to keep your seat belt on at all times every centimeter of slack in your seat belt triples the g force you ll experience in the crash so keep your seat belt properly tightened at all times you re on the aircraft push the belt down as low over your pelvis as possible you should be able to feel the upper ridge of the pelvis above the upper edge of the belt which helps to brace you in an emergency much better than your soft stomach leave your belt on even if you re sleeping if something happens while you re out you ll be glad to have the restraints in place assess the situation try to determine what surface the plane will land on so you can customize your preparations if you re going to be landing in water for example you ll want to put your life vest on though you need to wait to inflate it until you re out of the plane if you re going to be landing in cold weather you should try to get a blanket or jacket to keep you warm once outside plot out the general course you ll be on ahead of time so you ll have some idea of where you are when the plane crashes if you re flying from iowa to california you can be fairly certain you won t be landing in the ocean use the time before the crash to find your exit if the plane is going to crash you almost always have several minutes to prepare before impact use this time to once again review where the exits are prepare your space as much as possible if you know you re going to crash return your seat back to its full upright position and stow away any loose items that could become hazardous if at all possible zip up your jacket and make sure your shoes are tied tightly to your feet then assume one of two standard brace positions used for surviving a plane crash and try to remain calm 5 x research source in either position your feet should be flat on the floor and further back than your knees to reduce injuries to your feet and legs which you will need in order to successfully exit the craft after impact place your legs as far under the seat as possible to avoid breaking your shin bones brace yourself against the seat in front of you if the seat in front of you is close enough to reach place one hand palm down on the back of that seat then cross the other hand palm down over the first hand rest your forehead against your hands keep your fingers unlaced it s also sometimes recommended that you put your head directly against the seat in front of you and lace your fingers behind your head tucking your upper arms against the sides of your head to cradle it bend forward if there s no seat in front of you if you don t have a seat close in front of you bend forward and put your chest on your thighs and your head between your knees cross your wrists in front of your lower calves and grab your ankles try and remain calm it can be easy to get swept up in the pandemonium immediately preceding and following a crash keep a cool head though and you re more likely to get out alive remember that even in the worst wrecks you do have a chance of survival you ll need to be able to think methodically and rationally to maximize that chance put on your life jacket but do not inflate it in the case of a crash in water if you inflate it in the plane when it starts to fill up with water the life jacket will force you upwards against the cabin roof and it will be very hard to swim back down leaving you trapped instead hold your breath and swim out once you re out inflate it 6 x research source put your oxygen mask on before assisting others you ve probably heard this on every commercial flight you ve been on but it s worth repeating if the integrity of the cabin is compromised you have only about 15 seconds or less to start breathing through your oxygen mask before you are rendered unconscious 7 x research source while you may feel an impulse to first help your children or the elderly passenger sitting next to you you ll be no good to anyone if you don t remain conscious also remember that you can put somebody else s oxygen mask on even if they re unconscious this might help save their life protect yourself from smoke fire and smoke are responsible for the largest percentage of crash fatalities the smoke in an airplane fire can be very thick and highly toxic so cover your nose and mouth with a cloth to avoid breathing it in if possible moisten the cloth to provide extra protection 8 x research source stay low as you escape to duck under the level of smoke it might not seem like a big deal but passing out due to smoke inhalation is one of the most dangerous things that can happen during this critical period get out of the airplane as quickly as possible according to the national transportation safety board ntsb 68 percent of plane crash deaths are due to post crash fire not injuries sustained in the crash itself 9 x research source it s critical to get out of the aircraft without delay if fire or smoke is present you will generally have less than two minutes to safely exit the plane make sure the exit you choose is safe look through the window to determine if there is fire or some other hazard outside of an exit if there is try the exit across the plane or proceed to another set of exits listen to the flight attendants post crash instructions flight attendants undergo rigorous training to make sure they know what to do in the event of a crash if a flight attendant is able to instruct or assist you listen closely and cooperate to increase everyone s chances of survival ditch your stuff don t try to rescue your belongings it s common sense but still some people don t seem to get it leave everything behind rescuing your belongings will only slow you down 10 x research source if you end up needing to salvage supplies from the plane crash site worry about that later right now you need to make sure that you get clear of the wreckage and find some safe cover get out now get at least 500 feet 152 4 m upwind from the wreckage if you re stranded in a remote area the best thing to do usually is to stay close to the aircraft to await rescuers you don t want to be too close though fire or explosion can happen at any time after a crash so put some distance between you and the plane if the crash is in open water swim as far away from the plane wreckage as possible 11 x research source stay in one place but pay attention to what needs to happen while it s essential to stay calm after a crash you also need to recognize when you need to act and do so swiftly help out people who are struggling and tend to people s wounds using basic first aid available attend to your own wounds if at all possible check yourself for cuts and other abrasions and apply pressure if necessary stay in one place to reduce the chance of exacerbating internal injuries negative panic is a strange inability to react assertively and appropriately to the situation for example a person may just remain in his or her seat instead of heading toward the exit watch out for this in your fellow passengers or traveling companions 12 x research source call emergency services and wait for rescue you stand a much higher chance of surviving if you just stay put don t wander off and look for help or try to find something close by if your plane went down there will be people on the way quickly and you want to be there when they arrive just stay put,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to survive a plane crash on a deserted island,plane crashes are one of the least likely accident to occur with the number of accidents being less than 1 accident per million flights in the unlikely situation that you find yourself on a deserted island it is essential to know a few basic steps to survive the days that are to follow read on to find out how,tend to the injured if one of your fellow passengers is a trained professional like a doctor or nurse do what they say if not you will have to take matters into your own hands use the process of triage assess the status of each survivor a person who is screaming or moaning is obviously alive but a silent person is not they are likely to have more severe injuries and should be attended to first when tending to an injured person check their pulse first put your ear against the person s mouth to hear feel if they re breathing if they re not attempt cpr if they re bleeding find a rag or rip off your own clothing apply pressure and tie the cloth around the wound tightly to control bleeding do what you can gather food you may find berries in the forest but be careful they may be poisonous to see if they are cut the berry in half and rub it on your wrist wait if nothing happens rub a little of it on the edge of your mouth wait if nothing happens rub a little of it on your lip wait if nothing happens put it in your mouth and slowly chew there is probably food on the plane so try to rummage through the wreckage and find some make spears out of sharpened wood to hunt bury or burn someone s body in the tragic event that someone died during the crash and if rescue hasn t arrived for four days consider these measures the rotting bodies could cause disease and attract wild animals make sure you leave no remnants of the dead bodies make huge bonfires this will help rescue planes to find you make shelters use pieces of the plane wood leaves from the forest and anything else you can find build a fort if necessary find water water is most important there may be bottled water on the plane the best way to get water is to explore the island a little bit but don t stray too far from camp try to find a river stream lake or other fresh body of water if it looks foggy nothing is alive around it or it looks like there is oil in it do not drink it do not drink salt water salt water will quicken dehydration if you can t find water here are other ways get a plastic blanket and some big strong sticks and put the sticks up next tie the blankets to the sticks and when it rains the rain catcher will collect water,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to handle airplane turbulence,turbulence makes most people nervous but it s rare to be hurt by it and it definitely doesn t mean there s a problem with the plane there are lots of ways to handle turbulence calmly learning how to prepare for your flight fight nausea and anxiety and stay safe during turbulence will help you weather the bumpy ride as calmly as possible,learn about the causes of turbulence turbulence during a flight is caused by uneven air distribution it doesn t mean the plane is going to crash learning about what causes turbulence and how it might affect your plane can help you enjoy the flight and handle any turbulence calmly research turbulence online or talk to airport staff to ease your mind if you want to research online search for turbulence only and avoid articles about plane crashes this won t help calm you down talk to your doctor about anti anxiety or nausea medication if turbulence makes you sick or very anxious it s totally fine to talk to your doctor about medication that can help you many doctors offer short term prescriptions especially for patients who are about to board a flight you can even buy anti nausea medication over the counter 1 x research source choose a comfortable seat towards the front of the plane the front of the plane is somewhat less likely to be affected by turbulence so choose a seat as close to the front as you can if you prefer a window or aisle seat choose that too the more comfortable you are the less you ll be bothered by turbulence 2 x research source get to the airport early feeling calm and relaxed will help you handle turbulence more effectively and it s easier to calm down if you aren t rushed and stressed get to the airport as early as you can to have some time to relax before your flight bring along a favorite book or movie to watch to get you in a calmer state of mind before boarding 3 x research source use the bathroom before your flight the best way to avoid injury during turbulence is to stay in your seat with your seatbelt buckled make sure you go to the bathroom before you board and if you need to get up to speak to anyone on the plane do so before takeoff 4 x research source get as comfortable as possible airplane seats can be small and cramped but try to get as comfortable as you can wear loose comfortable clothes ask for pillows and blankets if you need them and adjust the seat back to get into a state of relaxation 5 x research source take deep regular breaths if you start to feel anxious during the flight practice taking deep regular breaths to prevent yourself from hyperventilating take a deep slow breath hold it for three seconds and then release it slowly repeat for as long as you need to 6 x research source meditate or think calming thoughts meditation can help you fight anxiety try getting into a comfortable position closing your eyes and concentrating on your breathing before focusing your thoughts on staying calm if you d rather not meditate try thinking of something you find soothing 7 x research source think about what you re looking forward to at your destination your favorite childhood memories or even just a movie you really like massage your pressure points rubbing your body s pressure points can help you relax you won t be able to reach all of them while sitting in an airplane seat but you can massage the ridges of your neck your wrists and the web between your thumb and index finger during the flight to stay calm 8 x research source keep distracted with onboard entertainment make sure you have lots of entertainment options to keep yourself distracted during your flight if your flight offers a media center or an in flight movie take advantage of it even if you ve already seen the movie if you don t know if your flight has in flight media bring your own a book crossword puzzle or a movie on a portable player will help keep you distracted and relaxed 9 x research source take nausea medicine before your flight if you take medicine for nausea caused by turbulence take it about an hour before you board and keep it within reach in case you need in during the flight be sure to follow the instructions exactly and ask your doctor about any side effects that might make the flight more difficult for you 10 x research source keep the motion sickness bag handy as soon as you sit down find the motion sickness bag and move it somewhere you can access easily in case of emergency practice opening it so you ll know how to do it quickly just in case 11 x research source bring your own food nausea can be brought on or aggravated by food you aren t used to if you know you struggle with in flight nausea bring your own food so airline food doesn t make it worse avoid spices dairy and anything that triggers nausea for you some foods like soups or sauces may not be allowed through security ask airport staff before you arrive or consider buying food from the grocery section in airport stores drink lots of water the dry air inside an airplane can cause dehydration which is a major contributing factor for nausea be sure to drink enough water to stay hydrated about one regular size bottle for every three hours of flight will be enough for most people 12 x research source avoid caffeine and alcohol caffeine and alcohol can both aggravate nausea so try to avoid them on your flight if you do have a coffee or a beer sip them slowly to avoid upsetting your stomach 13 x research source keep your seatbelt on pilots usually know in advance if there s going to be turbulence but sometimes it takes them by surprise keeping your seatbelt on even when the seatbelt light is off will help keep you safe and secure in your seat if the belt is uncomfortable try loosening it a little enough to let you shift positions but not enough to let you stand up or lean into the next seat avoid getting up during the flight most turbulence injuries happen to people who were moving around in the plane during flight try to take care of bathroom visits staff questions and chats with friends in different rows before the flight takes off if you do need to get up during the flight return to your seat as soon as possible 14 x research source if there s a long line for the bathroom wait in your seat instead of standing in line stow all loose items if you have anything sitting loose on your seat or the floor it can go flying during turbulence and injure someone make sure everything you bring with you is stored in the overhead compartment or the seat pocket ask the flight attendant to dispose of food wrappers and dishes as soon as you re done with them if there s sudden turbulence while you re holding something grip it as tightly as possible keep your tray table folded when you re not using it hitting the tray table during turbulence can be pretty painful if you aren t eating or resting a computer on it keep the tray table closed sit in the closest seat if you re up during turbulence if you re in the aisles during severe turbulence don t worry about finding your way back to your seat just sit in the first empty seat you can find and buckle yourself in even if someone else s stuff is there as soon as the turbulence stops you can return to your regular seat 15 x research source if turbulence hits while you re in the bathroom grab the side handles and stay put staying in a small space like an airplane bathroom is much safer than walking through the main cabin obey the flight crew s instructions the flight crew might ask you to remain seated assist other passengers or put items away in the event of turbulence if the flight attendant or pilot instructs you to do something listen to them they have your safety in mind,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to assume the brace position,the brace position is one of the key elements for survival in a plane crash unfortunately it is not demonstrated in all in flight safety demonstrations in the event of an emergency landing it is standard procedure that the cabin crew will demonstrate how to adopt the brace position before the emergency landing however crashes are often unexpected so you cannot rely on this alone fortunately this article will explain how to assume the brace position,when you hear a warning such as brace heads down stay down or you see the seatbelt sign right flash repeatedly immediately assume the brace position it is important to note that there are two different brace positions the first one is used when the seat in front of you can be reached such as when you are seated in economy coach class the second one is the brace position to assume when the seat back in front of you cannot be reached such as when you are seated in first class ensure your seatbelt is securely fastened place your hands together on top of your head do not interlock your fingers lean forward as far as possible so that your head touches the back of the seat in front of you ensure that your forearms cover the sides of your face to protect it from debris push your feet back past your knees partially under your seat keep your feet flat on the floor ensure your seatbelt is securely fastened bend your body forward so that your head is down around your knees link your arms together behind or around your legs to stop them from moving forward during impact push your feet back past your knees and keep them flat on the floor,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to be safe while flying,flying may seem scary but it s relatively a very safe way to travel however there are still some things you will need to know while flying this wikihow will teach you how to be safe during flight please refer to the safety information card located in your seat pocket and or the safety demonstration for safety information related to the particular aircraft you are on board,learn how to fasten your seat belt insert the metal tip into the buckle until it clicks then pull on the strap to tighten to unfasten lift on the flap of the buckle fasten your seat belt whenever the fasten seat belt sign is lit during this period it is dangerous to get out of your seat because of rough air or gravity if you are in an airplane lavatory wash your hands and move back to your seat fasten your seat belt whenever you are seated in the event of unexpected turbulence you will not be thrown up into the overhead compartment fasten your seat belt during an emergency this means that there is any reason that the plane needs to be grounded including a loss of cabin pressure a plane engine failure the loss of adequate fuel plane malfunction etc fasten your seat belt whenever instructed to do so this is not an exhaustive list on when you should fasten your seatbelt but if a flight attendant or the captain determines that seatbelts need to be fastened they will instruct you to put it on fasten your seat belt over blankets during long flights it may feel good to take a long nap onboard but in order to not be disturbed by a flight attendant make sure that your seat belt is visible when you are sleeping turn off your peds or place your peds in airplane flight or non transmitting mode during taxi takeoff and landing during these periods communication with air traffic control is essential for a safe takeoff and landing using such peds may cause interference with aircraft equipment putting other passengers and yourself in danger place your peds in airplane mode throughout the flight transmitting devices can be dangerous whenever the plane is airborne most air carriers and the fcc require that peds are placed in airplane mode whenever the boarding door is closed this ensures that no electronic devices are transmitting during the flight at any time accept that certain peds cannot be used during the flight depending on the device you may have to power down the device fully for part or all of the flight phones and tablets may be used in airplane mode during the flight at any time as long as they are secure if the device transmits and does not have an airplane mode then it may not be used laptops and large tablets need to be stowed away under the seat in front of you or underneath your seat during taxi takeoff and landing radio equipment including remote control toys fm am radio and walkie talkies may not be used at any time during the flight as well as any transmitting device that does not have an airplane mode understand when you can use peds peds may be used whenever the flight attendant or captain informs you in addition to the above and need to be shut off whenever the please turn off electronic devices light is lit be ready to use your oxygen mask should there be a loss of air oxygen masks will drop down from the panel above you fasten your seatbelt and pull the mask towards you to start the flow of oxygen slip the elastic band over your head and tighten using the straps on either side of the mask do not worry if the plastic bag does not inflate just breathe normally remember to put your mask on first before assisting anyone else with theirs locate your nearest emergency exit they are usually marked with the words exit or the equivalent in another language lights and strips throughout the cabin will also help guide you to them in a power loss or the presence of smoke or fog they may be behind you as well understand that if you are seated near an emergency exit you may have to assist other passengers in an evacuation if you are unwilling or unable to assist other passengers in an emergency then ask a flight attendant to reseat you know how to operate an emergency exit these exits are heavy and open by pulling a strap or a handle some emergency exits are equipped with an exit slide that may or may not be detachable other emergency exits have stairs or require you to climb on the wing know when it is safe to open an emergency exit if you see smoke fire water or anything that may endanger the passengers onboard then find a different exit learn how to put on a life vest they are usually located underneath or next to your seat tear the pouch open wrap the buckle or string around you and tighten then inflate the life vest by pulling on the tabs or blowing into the tubes some life vests are designed for young children others are equipped with water activated locator lights know how to evacuate brace yourself for landing unfasten your seat belt proceed to the nearest emergency exit and hop onto the evacuation slide or step down the stairs if on water then be sure to put on a life vest or use the seat cushions for flotation do not smoke onboard the aircraft includes e cigarettes there is the risk of fires caused by burning cigarettes it is bad for you and others since the cabin is pressurized and it is illegal tampering with smoke detectors onboard the aircraft is also forbidden and can result in large fines follow all crew member instructions posted placards and lighted information signs they exist for your own safety and as a reminder of what is legal and what is not legal onboard the aircraft do not discuss anything about hijacking explosives bombs guns knives or other dangerous weapons onboard the airplane wear headphones if you are watching a movie or playing a game with such sound effects to avoid being mistaken for a hijacker or terrorist be courteous to others airlines have no problems with removing people from aircraft who pose a nuisance to other passengers do not open nuts onboard the plane if someone has a nut allergy on board and if a passenger asks you to stop what you are doing for whatever reason stop be hygienic airplanes are one place that infections can spread because space is closed do not change babies anywhere except on baby changing tables in the lavatories and wash your hands after you are done using the lavatory you should assume that others are not were not hygienic before you so take caution when eating foods off of tables seats seat pockets and other places onboard aircraft prepare for takeoff place your electronic devices in airplane mode or turn them off and stow them away make sure that your tray tables are up your seat backs are upright your window blinds are open your armrests are down and your monitors are folded back while the flight attendants walk in,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to handle air rage,flying tends to fill people with anxiety and worry the fear of the unknown along with going through endless security checkpoints tends to spike up a person s stress levels placing all of these people together in a small area is often a recipe for disaster which is why air rage occurs you can stop yourself from acting on this rage by first understanding why it happens doing what you can to prevent it from rearing its ugly head and then calming yourself down when you begin to experience it,get a good night s sleep being tired is often the straw that breaks the camel s back in a stressful situation being tired and grumpy on top of experiencing the stress and anxiety that flying brings can make you experience rage you wouldn t normally otherwise getting a good night s sleep before your flight especially if it takes off in the early morning can stop you from seeing red improve your own sleeping habits by increasing the comfort in your bedroom at home use blackout curtains lower the temperature and ensure that your mattress is comfortable and supportive turn off electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bed to fall asleep easier 1 x trustworthy source helpguide nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free evidence based mental health and wellness resources go to source if you re taking an overnight flight try to bring the comforts of home with you on the plane place ear plugs a sleeping mask and a comfy blanket into your carry on bag and wear them when you are trying to sleep doing so may make the rest of your night more enjoyable 2 x research source strike up a conversation with a fellow passenger sometimes just talking with someone can help to quell your feelings of rage chances are the person sitting near you might welcome a distraction as well instead of flying off the handle start talking to someone around you about something positive choose a general topic that you think might be of interest to both of you doing so will make you feel better and could prevent air rage for example you could ask the person about the purpose of their visit to your destination city and share your reason for the flight as well try saying something like hi my name is rick what s yours so are you traveling for business or pleasure and what are your plans for your visit after getting to know each other this could lead to other conversation topics such as hobbies pets family etc opening up a line of discussion in this way will likely make the person laugh and feel comfortable with you then you may have the chance to talk off your stress and feel better in the end 3 x research source plan ahead part of the reason people get so stressed when flying is because something they weren t prepared for occurs delayed flights lost luggage a lack of rental cars and long check in lines can start your trip out on the wrong foot by taking care of what you can before you step into the airport and arming yourself with as much information as possible you may be able to avoid the extra stress do what you can to avoid having to deal with employees by checking in online and using a kiosk for your luggage also signing up to receive text updates about your flight status and booking your rental car ahead of time can leave you feeling prepared and confident about what lies ahead 4 x research source acknowledge and accept your discomfort it is normal to feel fear and frustration if you are feeling angry anxious restless or something else give yourself a moment to acknowledge how you are feeling say comforting things to yourself like it is okay that i am nervous and i can cope and manage my feelings ask for help if the child behind you is kicking your chair constantly or the person in front of you is being loud and obnoxious ask the flight attendant to say something to encourage them to stop part of a flight attendant s job is to keep everyone on the flight comfortable this can include attempting to stop a few rowdy passengers from ruining the flight for everyone else approach the subject quietly and politely simply tell the flight attendant that you are unable to enjoy your flight because there are a few people who are being loud or acting inappropriately and ask if they would mind encouraging them to stop chances are the flight attendant will take swift action and hopefully the passengers will heed their advice 5 x research source listen to music one of the best things about flying is that you are able to distract yourself listening to music can not only take your mind off of what is going on around you but it can help you to calm down put on your headphones close your eyes and try to get your mind off of what is angering you select your music wisely while you may love an explosive beat or a fast paced song listening to it may get you pumped up even more you may want to opt for slow and calming music to help you relax 6 x research source count and breathe deeply slowing down and counting to 10 when you re angry may seem like a cliché but it actually works additionally taking deep breaths can help to calm your mind and decrease your rage although these exercises may not remove the situation at hand they can help you handle it better 7 x trustworthy source national domestic violence hotline organization providing lifesaving tools support and resources for victims and survivors of domestic abuse go to source breathing tends to quicken and become shallow when you are stressed making a conscious effort to breathe slowly and deeply can help to reduce your anxiety to breathe deeply take a long deep breath in through your nose hold for a few seconds and then exhale through your mouth repeat this exercise several times to help calm yourself you can also try saying the word relax to yourself silently as you exhale examine the consequences antics on a plane don t just end in the air if the passengers or staff feel threatened by you they may call the police who will meet you upon landing you could face charges or get arrested for your actions before you allow your stress and anger to take over think about what may happen if you do 8 x research source book a flight with a plane that has a bigger cabin or larger seats sitting close to strangers fighting for room and feeling claustrophobic are all reasons why people in airplanes become on edge additionally dealing with inconsiderate passengers like those who kick the seat in front of them talk too loudly or have no regard for those around them can increase a person s stress level the combination of all of these factors is enough to cause someone to become so irritated they react differently to being agitated than they would otherwise 9 x trustworthy source proceedings of the national academy of sciences official peer reviewed and multidisciplary journal for the national academy of sciences go to source avoid walking by the first class section research has shown that some air rage occurs because passengers feel they are the subject of inequality people who aren t sitting in the first class section are often upset because of the amenities provided in that section aren t offered to them as a result they may lash out on other passengers or the crew because they feel like injustices are occurring you can avoid this cause of resentment by booking a flight on a plane that doesn t have a first class section select the right company to fly with and you may avoid feeling this rage 10 x trustworthy source science magazine respected multidisciplinary scientific journal go to source skip the alcohol and pills some people turn to drinking or pills before they get on the plane to help combat anxiety about flying although it is a good idea in theory doing so may actually backfire people tend to become more impulsive and let go of their inhibitions when they are under the influence of alcohol or sedatives this means you may experience rage you wouldn t normally and lash out on someone who is irritating you 11 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to fly an airplane,if you re looking to fly a plane legally and safely you ll need to sign up for thorough training and get your pilot s license but if you re curious about what a pilot does to safely fly a plane or you re embarking on flying lessons yourself this overview of the process can provide some insights it s not a simple task and a full airplane manual comprises hundreds of pages the below basics will help get you familiar with what a pilot does and as a pilot trainee what you will encounter during your first few training flights if you would like a more detailed article or for an emergency situation visit prepare to fly an airplane in an emergency or fly a cessna,perform an inspection of the aircraft before getting in before taking off it s important to perform a walk around examination called a pre flight this is a visual inspection of the aircraft to verify that the airplane components are in good working order your instructor should provide you with a highly useful operating checklist for the specific plane and this checklist will tell you exactly what to do in each phase of flight even pre flight 1 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source the basics of pre flight 2 x research source check control surfaces remove any control locks and make sure your ailerons flaps and rudder are moving freely and smoothly visually check your fuel tanks and oil make sure they re filled to the specified levels to check the fuel level you ll need a clean fuel measuring rod to check oil there s a dipstick in the engine compartment check for fuel contaminants this is done by draining a small amount of fuel into a special glass container tool and looking for water or dirt in the fuel your instructor will show you how fill out a weight and balance sheet which helps ensure that you are not flying outside the capabilities of your airplane your instructor will show you how look for nicks dings and any other type of body damage these small imperfections might inhibit your aircraft s flying ability especially if the prop is compromised always check props before an engine start use caution around airplane props if there are electrical issues with the plane the prop could turn over unexpectedly causing severe injury check emergency supplies although it is not pleasant to think about prepare for the worst there is always the possibility of something going wrong with the aircraft make sure there is a supply of food water and first aid items also ensure that you have an operating radio flashlight and batteries a weapon may be needed along with standard repair parts for the plane locate the flight control column in the cockpit when you take your seat in the cockpit all of the systems and gauges will look complicated but they ll look much simpler once you become familiar with what they do in front of you will be a flight control that looks like a modified steering wheel 3 x research source this control more commonly called the yoke works like a steering wheel in a car it controls the pitch of the nose up or down and banking of the wings get a feel for the yoke push to go down pull to go up and use left and right to roll unsurprisingly left and right don t use too much force when flying it doesn t take much to control the plane locate the throttle and fuel mixture controls they are usually located between the two seats in the cockpit the throttle is black 4 x research source and the mixture knob is red in general aviation they are usually just push pull knobs thrust is controlled by the throttle and the mixture knob adjusts the fuel to air ratio lean or rich in gas familiarize yourself with the flight instruments on most aircraft there are six primary flight instruments located along two horizontal rows these indicators are often referred to as the six pack and show among other things altitude attitude orientation of the aircraft relative to earth s horizon compass heading and speed both forward and up or down rate of climb 5 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source top left the airspeed indicator shows aircraft airspeed usually in knots 6 x research source a knot is one nautical mile per hour about 1 15 mph or 1 85km h 7 x research source top center the artificial horizon shows the aircraft attitude that is whether the plane is climbing or descending and how it is banking left or right top right the altimeter shows the height altitude of the aircraft in feet msl feet above mean or average sea level 8 x research source lower left the turn and bank indicator is a dual instrument which tells how fast you are changing the compass heading rate of turn and also whether you are in co ordinated flight this is also called the turn and slip indicator or needle ball lower center is the heading indicator which shows your aircraft current compass heading this instrument should be calibrated usually every 15 minutes to calibrate adjust the instrument to agree with the compass this is done on the ground or if in flight only in straight and level flight lower right is the vertical speed indicator which tells how fast you are climbing or descending in feet per minute 9 x research source zero means that you are maintaining altitude and are neither climbing nor descending locate the landing gear controls many small planes have fixed gear in which case you will not have a landing gear control knob for airplanes that do have a landing gear control the location varies but it usually has a white rubber handle you will be using this after you take off and before you land and taxi the plane it may deploy any non fixed landing gear wheels skis skids or floats beneath place your feet on the rudder pedals these are a set of pedals at your feet used to control the rudder which is attached to the vertical stabilizer when you want to make minor adjustments to go left or right on the vertical axis use the rudder pedals basically the rudder controls the yawing aspect of turning the aircraft turning on the ground is also controlled by the rudder pedals and or the brakes not by the yoke 10 x research source get permission to take off if you are at a controlled airport you must contact ground control before taxiing they will give you further information as well as a transponder code commonly called a squawk code 11 x research source be sure to write this down as this information must be repeated to ground control before you are given clearance for takeoff once given clearance proceed to the runway as directed by ground control making sure to never cross any runway unless you are cleared to do so adjust the flaps to the proper angle for takeoff usually 10 degrees of flaps are used to help increase lift check your aircraft manual though some aircraft do not use flaps for takeoff perform an aircraft run up procedure before you reach the runway stop at the run up area you ll have to perform the engine run up procedure here this helps insure that your aircraft is ready to fly safely 12 x research source ask your instructor to show you this procedure notify the tower that you re ready for takeoff after completing a successful run up notify the tower and wait to be cleared to continue to and or enter the runway 13 x research source start the take off run push the fuel mixture knob completely in and advance the throttle slowly this will increase the engine rpms revolutions per minute generating thrust and the airplane will start to move note though that the plane will want to go left when you do this so add proper rudder to stay on the runway centerline 14 x research source if there s a crosswind you will need to turn the yoke carefully into the wind as you pick up speed slowly decrease this correction you ll need to control the yaw twisting on a vertical axis with the rudder pedals if the plane starts doing twisting use the foot pedals to control it get up to speed in order to take off into the air the plane needs to achieve a certain speed to create enough lift the throttle should be full on in most aircraft though some will have a maximum setting to reduce over torquing you will gradually build enough airspeed to become airborne usually around 60 knots for small planes the airspeed indicator will tell you when you have reached this speed 15 x research source when the plane gets enough lift you ll notice the nose lifting off the ground a bit pull gently back on the flight control being sure to maintain the proper climb rate for the particular aircraft pull back on the yoke at this point this will cause the whole airplane to leave the runway and rise into the air 16 x research source remember to maintain climb speed and apply proper rudder when at a safe height above the ground and you have a positive rate of climb as indicated by the vsi vertical speed indicator return the flaps and landing gear to neutral position this will reduce drag and extend the safe flying time and distance line up the artificial horizon or attitude indicator this will keep the plane level if you fall below the artificial horizon pull back to raise the nose of the airplane lifting it again be gentle it doesn t need much the best way to keep the plane at the right altitude is making sure you constantly scan the attitude indicator and the altimeter as well as the rest of the six pack get in the habit of scanning so that you don t fixate on any single instrument for an extended time bank turn the plane if you have a wheel in front of you the yoke turn it if it s a stick move it to the left or right to turn stay in coordinated flight by using the needle ball turn coordinator this gauge depicts a little airplane with a level line and a black ball along it keep the black ball in the center by adjusting the rudder so your turns feel smooth coordinated a useful learning aid is think step on the ball to know which rudder pedal to step on when co ordinating a turn the ailerons control the bank angle and work in conjunction with the rudder when turning coordinate the rudder and ailerons by keeping the turn and bank instrument ball centered remembering to keep an eye on your altitude and air speed by scanning the six pack note when the yoke is turned to the left the left aileron goes up and the right goes down when turning right the right aileron goes up and the left aileron goes down do not worry too much about the mechanics of aerodynamics at this point just try to become familiar with the basic concepts manage the speed of the airplane every airplane has an engine power setting optimized for the cruise phase of flight once you ve reached your desired altitude this power should be set to around 75 trim the aircraft for straight and level flight you will feel the controls become smoother as you trim the plane you ll also find on some aircraft that this power setting is in the torque free zone where no rudder input is required to maintain straight line flight at maximum power you may find that the nose drifts laterally due to the engine torque and requires an opposite rudder correction similarly you may find that the opposite rudder input is required at flight idle power setting to keep the plane steady it s necessary to maintain sufficient airflow and speed flying too slowly or at overly steep angles can cause the plane to lose airflow and stall this is most dangerous during takeoff and landing but it s also important to keep the plane at the appropriate speed during flight just as you would wear out your car engine if you drove with your foot planted to the floor you ll do the same to the plane s engine only increase power to maintain airspeed in a climb and reduce power to descend without accelerating fly with a light touch on the controls if and when you experience extreme turbulence it is critical not to over correct sudden large changes in the control surface orientations can push the aircraft past its structural limits causing damage to the plane and potentially compromising its ability to continue flying another issue is carburetor icing there is a small knob labelled carb heat apply carb heat for short periods of time about every ten minutes or so especially at the high relative humidity levels that encourage icing 17 x research source note this only applies for planes with a carburetor don t zone out you still need to be scanning for other aircraft and keeping an eye on the six pack set the cruising engine speed once you get a constant cruising speed you can set the controls and lock them so the plane will remain at a constant power and you can focus on keeping it level at this stage reduce the power on the throttle to about 75 of where it was set for a single engine cessna this should be somewhere around 2400 rpm next set the trim the trim is a small surface on the edge of the elevator it can be moved from within the cockpit setting it correctly will prevent the plane from climbing or descending while in cruise flight 18 x research source there are different kinds of trim systems some consist of a wheel lever or crank which pulls a cable or rod attached to a trim surface bell crank another is a jackscrew and rod and yet others are an electrical system which is the easiest to use the trim setting on each plane has a corresponding speed that the aircraft will seek and hold it varies by weight plane design center of gravity and carrying weight cargo plus passengers get clearance to land using the communication radio an essential part of flight is staying in touch with atc air traffic control approach control or tower during approach and landing procedures you can find the correct frequencies on your sectional chart when changing frequencies on the communication radio it is courteous to listen for the better part of a minute to make sure no stations are in the middle of an exchange only when you are sure there are no conversations going on should you make your initial broadcast this helps to avoid the stepped on situation which occurs when multiple stations are broadcasting on the same frequency at the same time reduce the airspeed to do this reduce power and lower the flaps to the appropriate level do not deploy flaps at excessively high speeds only when airspeed is within the white arch on the airspeed instrument stabilize the airspeed and rate of descent by applying back pressure on the control wheel knowing if you re right just takes practice 19 x research source pick your aiming point and begin your descent get the right angle of descent and airspeed this is controlled by a mixture of throttle and yoke once you ve found a runway you need to have the combination exactly right to land when it comes to flying an airplane this is the hardest part a general rule is that the best approach speed is 1 3 multiplied by the stalling speed of the aircraft 20 x research source this should be indicated on the asi however always take into account wind speed too lower the nose and watch the numbers on the runway those are there for a reason they tell the pilot whether he or she is going to overshoot or land short lower the nose keeping the numbers right on your horizon if the numbers start to disappear under the aircraft nose you are landing long if the number distance themselves from the aircraft nose you are landing short as you get closer to the ground you will experience the ground effect this will be explained by your instructor in detail but basically the ground effect causes the plane to float a bit because of reduced drag near the ground reduce the throttle to idle raise the nose slowly by pulling back on the yoke until the two main wheels touch down continue holding the nose wheel off the ground it will settle to the ground by itself come to a stop once the nose wheel has touched down you can apply brakes to slow for exiting the runway exit as soon as possible on the off ramp specified by the tower never stop on a runway,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to get a private pilot s license usa,getting a pilot s license opens up doors of opportunities you may never have envisioned before in the united states under the federal aviation administration faa you can get a private pilot license ppl which will allow you to fly different kinds of aircraft and carry passengers for pleasure and personal flights you can upgrade this license to further advanced certificates and licenses there are many classes and categories for a ppl but typically the average student starts in a small single engine airplane so here are the basic steps to follow for getting your ppl for a single engine airplane,organize an orientation flight an orientation flight may be as simple as going to your nearest airport with a flight school the staff are usually as enthusiastic to get you in an airplane as you are the orientation flight exposes you to the experience of flying in an airplane and gives you a chance to evaluate yourself on how your body or mind responds i e nausea fear of heights most of these sensations and symptoms are temporary but it just depends on your body determination and your decision to continue obtain student pilot license and third class medical there is no minimum age requirement to begin flight training however you must be at least sixteen to fly solo for an airplane provided you have a license and a medical from a designated aviation medical examiner ame student pilot license to apply you must comply with 14 cfr 61 83 you must be of the eligible age and read speak write and understand the english language 1 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source third class medical like the name implies this is an examination of your physical state by an ame a list of examiners in your area can be found on the faa website organize your plan there are many ways to acquire an aircraft and a certified flight instructor cfi you could know a generous aircraft owner and a family friend who happens to be a cfi or finding a local fixed based operator fbo with planes and instructors another option in enrolling in an accredited flight training program in a college environment if you are interested in both the license and a degree there is nearly an infinite number of ways to find a plane and an instructor for you to receive flight training the average cost of flight training is 9 900 through a flight school so budgeting is very important the cost of training can be reduced if you purchase your own aircraft but buying an airplane is a large responsibility and can be very expensive how long it takes to get a license can vary for some people it can take weeks if they are prioritizing it others can take a few months if the license is not thier main priority due to school marriage work etc do your pre solo flight training before your first solo your cfi will train you to the standards outlined by 14 cfr 61 87 for a single engine land plane only paragraphs a b c d and n apply aeronautical knowledge 2 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source your cfi will administer a written test and then review the test with you and examine that you are competent to operate the aircraft by yourself he may cover the physics of flight the applicable regulations airspace procedures weather landing techniques aircraft specifications and the like maneuvers and procedure for pre solo flight training there is a list of maneuvers he is required to at least demonstrate and some to have you perfect they are specified under 14 cfr 61 87 d and include pre flight procedures taxiing and ground operations takeoff turns stalls descents landings etc 3 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source do your post solo flight training after you solo there are a few major flight training exercises left to complete at this point your cfi is now having you fulfill the aeronautical experience requirement found under 14 cfr 61 109 a this is the bare minimum experience needed for a ppl you must log at least 40 hours of flight time that includes at least 20 hours of flight training from an authorized instructor and 10 hours of solo flight training 4 x research source flight training is not a race and the average student pilot usually has 60 to 80 hours of total flight time when they apply for thier license the flying requires at least the following 3 hours of cross country flight training 3 hours of night flight training that includes one cross country flight and 10 takeoffs and 10 landings at an airport 3 hours of flight training on the control and maneuvering of an airplane solely by reference to instruments this is flying with the human equivalent of horse blinders and a taste of flying under instrument flight rules ifr as oppose to being under visual flight rules vfr as you have previously been experienced with 3 hours of flight training with an authorized instructor in preparation for the practical test which must have been performed within the preceding 2 calendar months from the month of the test this is your practice practical exam with your instructor and gives you a chance to work out any bugs 10 hours of solo flight time with at least one solo cross country flight ground school there is a written exam that

how to fly a cessna,this article focuses on taking you through all of the basics for the six instruments in a cessna 172 one of the most common aircraft the cessna 172 is illustrative of all similar types of aircraft moreover if needed you will be able to understand the more complex glass panel instruments and controls of newer and larger aircraft the framework for piloting an airplane consists of learning the most used instruments and controls becoming familiar with communication and navigation performing the pre flight procedure obtaining clearance and taking off in flight maneuvering obtaining clearance and landing mastering the below steps will take you a long way to passing your pilot s ground school exam flight test and getting your pilot s certificate,study a cessna 172 aircraft instrument panel it is a standard aircraft panel with six round basic flight instruments often called the six pack these are the ones in the center directly in front of the pilot s seat 1 x research source familiarize yourself with the six pack the six instruments are located on the instrument panel in the following order 2 x research source top left the airspeed indicator shows aircraft airspeed usually in knots a knot is one nautical mile per hour about 1 15 mph or 1 85km hr top center the artificial horizon shows the aircraft attitude and whether the plane is climbing or descending as well as whether it is in a bank to the left or to the right top right the altimeter shows the height altitude of the aircraft in feet msl feet above mean or average sea level lower left the turn and bank indicator is a dual instrument which tells what angle of bank you are in during a turn rate of turn and also whether you are in co ordinated flight and feeling the proper down in the seat g force from the turn this is also called the turn and slip indicator or needle ball lower center the heading indicator shows the aircraft s current compass heading this instrument needs to be calibrated on a regular schedule lower right the vertical speed indicator tells how fast the aircraft is climbing or descending note the two round instruments directly to the right of the six pack are dual vor vhf omni directional range instruments and to the right of them are two identical vor radios used for communications and vor navigation study the aircraft controls the necessary controls for flying this plane are 3 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source throttle a black knob when pushed forward the engine speed increases and when pulled back the engine speed decreases full back is idle speed 4 x research source fuel mixture a red knob pushed full inward is the richest mixture used for sea level takeoffs and landings full back will shut the engine off only pull the red knob fully out when you are on the ground and ready to shut down the engine 5 x research source carburetor heat used to warm the engine air intake in icing conditions notably on long descents with the engine at low power or idling conditions which result in a cold engine paired cold air which often cause icing 6 x research source note for all practical purposes this has to be either full on or full off flaps a flat handled switch used to select the wing flap positions flaps are usually deployed to slow the aircraft to a safe speed in preparation for landing note that the flaps should be advanced notch by notch one position 10 at a time fuel tank select a cessna 172 will almost always be set on both tanks yoke steering wheel this sets the attitude climb and turn and the speed of the aircraft use small pitch adjustments in and out for pitch to climb or descend turn the yoke left and right to bank the aircraft rudder pedals these are operated by your feet press the top edge of the pedals and the brakes are applied pressing the lower part of the pedals allows steering while on the runway control trim there are two trim wheels in the panel one trims the aileron and the other trims the rudder thereby reducing the control pressure required to operate the respective controls trimming allows you to more easily maintain your direction of flight take care not to over trim when landing as you may then not have enough pitch control to gain altitude quickly in case of a go around aborted landing learn the instruments and controls sit in the aircraft and spend time there just studying each instrument 7 x research source quiz yourself on each of the instruments you should be able find and name each instrument at a glance even in a darkened cockpit environment and also describe the information you get from each instrument look at the gauges and see if you can describe the instrument and know how you would use its readings to adjust your flight path it is highly recommended that you spend enough time in the aircraft to be comfortable with all of the instruments and feel like you have them mastered become familiar with the communication equipment purchase an aviation sectional chart before you begin purchase the chart at your local airport online or at a pilot s store then study the chart carefully find your local airport taking particular note of your airport s required communication and navigation frequencies find a radio manual and set up the radios at the required frequencies to communicate with the following order is an example for most cross country flights atis automatic terminal information system airport ground control airport tower airport departure control flight service stations atc air traffic control airport approach control the aviation emergency frequency commit the emergency frequency to memory but do not test it listen to these frequencies if you re not yet a pilot don t talk on them however if you are a new student you can tune in to the ground control frequency and ask ground control for a radio check alternatively your flight instructor will provide you with this information make sure to ask questions about anything you are unsure of practice changing between frequencies you should practice switching among the frequencies you need to use at your airport until this becomes second nature and you can switch and tune frequencies easily and naturally learn the vor vhf omni directional range 8 x research source vor a dual navigation system that will guide you from your departure to your destination accurately and reliably vor navigation is most important in ifr approaches but is no longer the only option when visibility is poor gps has been taking the place of vor in some aspects like vfr flights and even ils type approaches look at your sectional chart for your local airport and or nearby vor stations if you have the vor manual you should be able to listen to the vors and even test your vor instruments for accuracy by viewing them on the aircraft panel alternatively your instructor will show you how to set up the vor instruments and provide you with the required vor frequencies practice setting up your local airport vor frequency while you re on the ground some day it might be handy when you have to return to your airport after takeoff because you suddenly encounter poor visibility most airports have a vor test spot on the field called compass rose refer to airport diagram below taxi over to the compass rose test area and turn on the vors in your aircraft your vors should each be within 4 degrees of the required heading depending on where you intend to fly however you will need to master the gps learn the gps global positioning system 9 x research source gps is a navigation system that will guide you from departure to destination accurately and reliably now that gps systems have waas wide area augmentation system making gps as accurate as vor ils systems 10 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source most aircraft now have gps and some experienced pilots even a carry on handheld gps these hand helds not legal for guiding the aircraft but it still comes in handy from time to time turn on the gps and you ll see a display similar to your car gps however the aircraft version is such that you ll probably have to spend many hours to become really good at programming and interpreting the gps display and this should be your goal learn the adf automatic direction finder 11 x research source the adf system is a great backup system that will show you where you are using a system that seeks out any local adf ground station or any public am radio signal and points to the signal source if you turn and fly the direction the needle points it will take you directly to the ground station you will know when you fly over the station the needle will switch 180 degrees and point directly behind the aircraft this system makes an accurate and simple navigation aide become familiar with the transponder the transponder is a panel mounted instrument for sending your aircraft position and altitude to atc so they can track your aircraft for safety to you and to other aircraft 12 x research source atc may ask you to turn on your transponder and set it to send squawk 1200 pronounced squawk one two zero zero 1200 is the code for just a general vfr flight cruising around or in a practice area for instance if you should have a radio failure in flight squawk 7600 pronounced seven six zero zero so atc will know your problem atc will give you a code to enter into your transponder based on the type of flight you ll be making study the manual on this transponder and learn all the other modes of operation there are get to know the dme distance measurement equipment 13 x research source accurately measures and displays in nautical miles the straight line distance to your destination this is most useful in landing approaches learn the marker beacon system marker beacons are a three light radio beacon system 14 x research source this gives you a flashing light on your panel with a beeping sound when your aircraft is exactly over each of the markers showing your exact positions in the final approach to an airport the three markers are called outer marker middle marker and inner marker placed in three spaced positions down the centerline of the ils instrument landing system this system is designed to not waste any time of the pilot having to look for the instrument prepare for the latest in navigation safety ads b or automatic dependent surveillance broadcast is a cornerstone of next generation air traffic modernization 15 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source mandated soon by the faa for all aircraft operating in airspace that now requires a mode c transponder must be equipped with ads b this new system when properly installed and operated will allow the pilot to see and be seen and avoid all other aircraft in the vicinity in addition to aircraft traffic in flight services and weather information can also be supplied to the pilot perform the pre flight inspection before taking off it is important to perform a walk around examination this is a visual inspection of the aircraft to verify that the airplane components are in good working order your instructor should provide you with a more detailed and highly useful operating checklist not just for the walkaround but for all the specific airplane procedures that cover the other phases of flight 16 x research source complete a thorough walkaround follow the pre flight check list in the aircraft manual or one obtained from your instructor the most important required items will be listed in the pre flight checklist some are 17 x research source check control surfaces remove any control locks and make sure your ailerons flaps and rudder are moving freely and smoothly visually check your fuel tanks and oil make sure they re filled to the specified levels to check the fuel level you ll need a clean fuel measuring rod to check oil there s a dipstick in the engine compartment check for fuel contaminants this is done by draining a small amount of fuel into a special glass container and looking for water or dirt in the fuel your instructor should show you how if not ask look for nicks dings and any other type of body damage these small imperfections might inhibit your aircraft s flying ability especially if the prop is compromised always check props before an engine start and make sure to use caution around airplane props if there are electrical issues with the plane the prop could turn over unexpectedly causing severe injury fill out a weight and balance sheet calculating a weight and balance helps ensure that you are not flying outside the capabilities of your airplane 18 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source if you need to complete the weight and balance sheet because you have additional weight in the aircraft your instructor will show you how if it s just you and your instructor in the aircraft and you verify that there is no extra weight in the aircraft you normally won t have to complete a weight and balance sheet prepare the aircraft for flight work with your instructor to prepare the cockpit for flight your instructor will show you how to get the aircraft prepared there is a lengthy procedure to get the aircraft cockpit area set up and ready for starting the engine take your time work through this procedure and be sure not to miss anything the following procedures are just an approximation of what your instructor will ask you to perform this will show you what to expect but follow the directions of your instructor get clearance to taxi once the aircraft is set up and running turn on your strobe lights 19 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source you can now get clearance to taxi out any time you re in motion turn on your taxi lights also call ground control and ask for clearance to taxi out 20 x research source specify the runway and direction for example request a south departure on runway 20r pronounced two zero right or whatever direction and runway you prefer for departure listen to the clearance and write it down all pilots are required to read back all clearances to ground or any instructions given in all phases of flight follow the route given to you exactly as stated do not cross any runways until you re specifically told to do so by ground control always stop and ask if you re not sure if your stopping for an engine run up let ground control know perform the engine run up as described in your aircraft manual or by your instructor contact ground and request clearance to continue taxiing to the assigned runway continue taxi to the runway hold position sign and stop there do not let your aircraft be on or over any part of the hold position markings get the control tower instructions for takeoff if tower says line up and wait which means line up behind any aircraft ahead of you if no aircraft are in front of you then you may enter the runway but hold there for the final cleared for takeoff order from tower then read that back the command to line up and wait and the hold position sign are the most critical instructions in aviation and need to be completely understood by all pilots if in doubt stop and ask when on a runway always turn on strobe lights landing lights and nav lights 21 x research source then apply power and go after checking for any other aircraft on final approach or an aircraft or vehicle on the runway start your take off run 22 x research source push the fuel mixture knob fully inward and advance the throttle to full throttle as the aircraft gains speed it will pull to the left and you will have to add a little right rudder to stay on the runway center line pull gently back on the yoke when your speed reaches 55 knots this will cause the aircraft to slowly lift off the runway when the aircraft reaches 70 to 80 knots maintain that speed throughout the climb keep the wings level and showing only a few degrees of climb at the same time continue holding back on the yoke as needed to maintain 70 to 80 knots the required climb speed for a cessna 172 make the exit turn at about 500 ft 150m of altitude make your required exit turn most airports have a requirement of making a 45 turn to exit the airport area or you may request a straight out departure stay in coordinated flight by using the needle ball turn coordinator this gauge has a little airplane with a level line and a black ball that rolls back and forth along the line keep the black ball in the center by adjusting the rudder so your turns feel smooth coordinated pilots say step on the ball to know which rudder pedal to step on to center the ball and maintain a coordinated turn note that the ailerons control the bank angle and work in conjunction with the rudder when turning coordinate the rudder and ailerons by keeping the turn and bank ball centered maintain steady flight level out and setup cruise flight at this point departure control may ask you to turn on your transponder and set it to send squawk 1200 pronounced squawk one two zero zero the transponder is a panel mounted instrument for sending your aircraft position and altitude to atc so they can track your aircraft for safety to you and to other aircraft maintain your speed every airplane has an engine power setting optimized for the cruise phase of flight once you ve reached your desired altitude cruise power should be set between 2100 rpm and 2900 rpm the faa requires that all pilots must maintain an altitude at least 500ft above the highest object within 2000 feet horizontal in other words keep at about 1000ft agl at all times 23 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source at this point some pilots setup the automatic pilot and relax but most would prefer to fly the aircraft in any case the auto pilot is a very valuable instrument and will come in handy many times may even save lives so take time to study and learn how it works for future needs 24 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source if you choose to not use the auto pilot use vertical trim to maintain your desired altitude to fly you will seldom need to use aileron turn trim in this aircraft but verify that the aileron trim is set to zero get clearance to land using the communication radio 25 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source an essential part of flying is staying in touch with atc air traffic control approach control and tower in that order during approach and landing procedures you can find the correct frequencies on your sectional chart or on an approach chart as shown above atc may inform you of air traffic in your area faa s aim airman information manual requires that you respond by saying traffic in sight if you see the traffic or no contact if you don t be sure to respond promptly the tower will tell you something like report entering downwind for runway 25l pronounced two five left so set up your aircraft so you will approach runway 25l at the expected 45 degree angle so that you will enter the airport area about 500 ft 150m above the runway if given clearance to land runway 30 pronounced three zero that will always be a straight in approach see airport chart above the runway numbers refer to the compass heading of the runway the letters r l refer to the left and right runways when there are parallel runways as shown above there is a procedure called lahso land and hold short this requires you at some airport runways to land but hold short at the lahso sign at the runway crossing point ahead if you feel you can t handle this procedure tell tower and get another runway the above airport has such a procedure refer also to aviation phonetics chart below memorize this chart you will need to know them at all times that you are pic pilot in command reduce your airspeed to do this reduce power by backing off on the throttle but do not deploy the flaps yet only lower the flaps when you reach your entry point again do not lower the flaps when airspeed is excessive do so only when the airspeed is within the white arc on the airspeed instrument 26 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source stabilize the airspeed and rate of descent with a combination of yoke power and flaps down maintain your speed at 80 knots with a descent rate of 500 ft min 150m min until you reach about 1000 ft agl you may reduce the throttle to idle now if you prefer or later in the landing as long as you maintain your speed at 60 to 70 knots and hold that speed until you reach about 10 ft 3m above the runway you ll learn this with practice verify throttle at idle and raise the nose slowly by pulling back on the yoke try to hold the aircraft at a couple feet off the runway until the two main wheels touch down continue holding the nose wheel off the ground it will settle to the ground safer by itself apply some judicious braking once the nose wheel has touched down this will slow the aircraft for safely exiting the runway never stop on a runway unless told to by tower or ground control exit as quickly as possible using the off ramp specified by the tower you ll see runway boundary markings on the taxiway in front of you taxi quickly over this line to a point where the tail of your aircraft has also crossed the lines at this point stop and call ground control for permission to taxi to the parking area read back the instructions as always and follow the instructions back to the parking spot practice handling night approaches runway approaches at night show you a lot of helpful indicators about the runway approach area for safety reasons the row of lights across the runway end are called rail runway alignment indicator lights 27 x research source note also that the runway markings and side lights are white taxiway lights however are always blue learn and memorize aviation phonetics practice these phonetics you will need them constantly and at a moment s notice atc and all other aviation flight service stations will always use these phonetics don t make up your own study runway signs runway signs are very important all pilots need to learn what they mean 29 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source the runway signs shown above indicate that you re on taxiway alpha heading toward runway 21 pronounced runway two one there is an ils instrument landing system hold sign there and beyond that is a runway hold sign you need to stop at both hold signs unless already cleared to get permission to continue to runway 21 remember you must get line up and wait command before entering any runway if in doubt stop and ask whomever you re in radio contact

how to prepare yourself for your first flight,on average more than 8 million people fly every day 1 x research source every single one of them was at one time a first time flyer who had no idea what to expect but they learned how to buy a ticket get to the airport and get on the plane you will too flying can be safe and stress free as long as you are prepared and organized,buy a ticket for most people the easiest and most cost effective way to buy a ticket is through an online travel site if you prefer to talk to a person you can call the airline directly or use a travel agent once the ticket is purchased you will receive an email confirmation with the option to either print your ticket at home or link it to your phone you can also print your ticket at the airport 2 x research source if using an online site remember that not all airlines are represented to find the prices and schedules for these airlines such as southwest airlines you will have to go to their individual websites have a photo id you will need to show a current photo id card when you check in and again when you move through security check the airline website for a list of acceptable forms of id if you are flying internationally you will need a passport which is always accepted as proof of identification 3 x research source if traveling internationally be sure to find out if additional travel documents are needed some countries require visas that take several weeks to process pack efficiently most airlines charge a fee for every bag you need to check usually starting at about 25 for the first bag and going up to more than 100 for additional bags they will also charge additional fees for a bag weighing too much usually more than 50 lbs to avoid these fees pack as lightly as possible 4 x research source if you can fit everything into one carry on bag and one personal item such as a purse or small backpack you can usually avoid luggage fees altogether check the airline website for restrictions on what can be brought onboard in carry on luggage the primary restriction is that all liquids gels pastes etc need to be in 3 4 oz 100 ml or smaller containers and all your liquid containers need to fit into a clear quart bag 5 x trustworthy source u s transportation security administration u s government agency responsible for ensuring safety by setting and enforcing travel protocols go to source plan how you are getting to the airport if you are driving check the airport website to get information on where to park give yourself extra time if you are taking a cab or uber for the driver to arrive at your pick up spot confirm train or bus schedules if you are taking public transportation you do not want to add the stress of being late to your already hectic day 6 x expert source amy tan travel planner founder planet hoppers expert interview 12 march 2020 know where to go before leaving the house determine where you need to go at the airport to check in you can usually find this information on the airport website if it is not there you will see signs as you drive up to the airport complex that will direct you to the right terminal if you are parking in an economy lot away from the terminals the airport will typically run a free shuttle to and from the terminal be sure to write down where your car is parked all airport parking lots look alike and it is easy to forget where you parked if you are taking public transportation check where you need to get off and where you will pick it up again on your return arrive at the airport 2 3 hours ahead of your flight time most airlines will not allow you on the flight if you are not checked in at least 30 minutes before the scheduled departure 7 x research source if you only have carry on luggage you can save some time at the airport by checking in online at home or from your phone you will then be able to skip the check in counters at the airport and go directly to security check in follow the signs to the check in area for your airline most airlines now have self serve kiosks have your flight confirmation number ready and follow the directions on the kiosk screen the kiosk will print your boarding pass depending on the airline it might also print a luggage tag if the kiosk prints a luggage tag follow directions to tag your luggage and take it to the luggage drop off area if it the kiosk does not print a luggage tag an airline agent will call your name to come up to the desk to get your tag have your photo id and ticket ready to show them 8 x research source some airlines have curbside check in this can be a good solution if you have a lot of bags or are short on time be sure to tip the curbside agent go through security after checking in follow the signs for security when you reach the front of the line show the tsa agent your photo id and boarding pass once these items are verified grab a plastic bin and move to the conveyer belt put your shoes belongings and bag of liquids in the bin use a second bin if the first becomes too crowded use a separate bin for your laptop 9 x research source most times and at most airports the security process will take less than 20 minutes sometimes much less at some airports however especially around holiday times it can take 45 minutes or more sometimes much more to get through security be patient this is why you arrived early each country has its own security procedures but all involve showing a photo id and having your belongings scanned if the system isn t clear airport personnel are always willing to help you get through them correctly don t be afraid to ask if you have a question go to your gate check the electronic displays to find your flight and gate number gates sometimes change and the electronic boards will have the most updated information follow the signs to get to your gate if you are early feel free to wander into nearby stores or restrooms but don t go too far you don t want to miss the boarding call board your flight airlines have specific boarding procedures check your ticket to find out your boarding number or zone wait for your number or zone to be called the gate agents will explain the exact process before everyone starts boarding other passengers are also usually happy to help you navigate the system if you are flying domestically you will only need to present your boarding pass to the gate agent after your zone is called if you are flying internationally you might also be asked to show your passport as well as any needed visas at this time find your seat seat numbers are located above each row find your seat and put your carry on bag in the overhead bin nearest your seat put smaller items under the seat in front of you 10 x research source as a courtesy to other passengers airlines ask that you only put one item in the overhead bin so there is room for everyone if the overhead bins have filled before you board you can put your carry on under the seat in front of you if it fits or have the flight attendant check it there will be no charge if it is checked take your seat once you have placed your bag in the overhead bin take your seat and fasten your seat belt if you are in a middle or window seat you might have to ask someone who is already seated in your row to move into the aisle so you can get in that s ok everyone expects to do that 11 x expert source amy tan travel planner founder planet hoppers expert interview 12 march 2020 listen to the safety demonstration the flight attendants will begin a safety demonstration after all the passengers are seated listen carefully and familiarize yourself with the procedures it s extremely unlikely that anything will happen but it s good to know what to do if it does even if the fasten seat belt sign is off it s a good idea to keep your belt fastened whenever you are seated the pilot will normally let you know if the plane is entering a turbulent area but sometimes there will be an unexpected rough patch don t worry about a few bumps airplanes are built to handle turbulence enjoy the flight once you are air borne the flight attendants will begin food and drink service most airlines provide free non alcoholic beverages depending on the length of your flight you might also have the option of purchasing meals beer and other alcoholic drinks if you know you are going to want to eat on the plane bring your own food you can bring it from home if it doesn t contain liquids or purchase it at the airport most airlines now provide in seat entertainment so you can watch movies and other shows while flying many airlines now provide under seat power ports to encourage passengers to bring their own tablets and laptops for their entertainment you will also often be able to connect to a wifi system for an extra fee get ready to land toward the end of the flight the crew will make announcements to prepare everyone for landing they will ask that large electronic devices be put away and they will clear up any trash you might have stay in your seat after landing after the airplane has landed stay in your seat until the plane reaches its gate when the plane is at the gate and stopped the pilot will turn off the seat belt sign now is the time to unbuckle your seat belt get off the plane the front rows will leave the plane first followed in turn by each following row when it is your row s turn stand up collect your bag from the overhead bin and proceed down the aisle and out the door while you are waiting for your turn check to make sure you have everything you brought on you will not be allowed to get back on the plane to get your phone if you leave it in the seat pocket get your baggage follow signs for baggage claim once in the area there will be

how to get a private pilot s license general,getting your private pilot s license takes a lot of time and effort but it s worth it to be able to explore the skies while each country has different costs of training and testing the general path to getting a license is fairly similar to obtain the license you will have to study extensively either on your own or in class in addition you will have to do 40 70 hours of flight training to learn the ropes you will also have to pass several exams to determine whether or not you are ready to hold your license with determination and focus you will be able to complete all your training and testing and live out your dreams of flight,make sure you meet the basic requirements there are a couple basic requirements that you must meet to be able to get your license you must be 17 or older and you must be fluent in english this is an international requirement even if you are getting your license in a country whose official language is not english 1 x research source english is the international language of aviation a measure put in place by icao or the international civic aviation organization make sure you have enough money getting your private pilot license is an expensive process not only do you have to pay for flying lessons but most people have to rent a plane to use for lessons which is usually the highest cost in addition you have to pay for equipment fuel and test costs total costs for a private pilot s license in the united states usually run between 8 000 and 13 000 it may vary depending on what country you live in 2 x research source there are a few things you can do to cut the cost if you have multiple options of places to take lessons find lessons at the best value you can buy cheaper or used equipment study hard for your exams so that you don t fail and have to take them multiple times taking the exams costs money so you will save if you pass them the first time another thing is to consider getting a sport license which requires only 20 training hours this can save you a few thousand dollars if you have a sports license you can still carry a passenger with you but there are a few restrictions these include that you cannot fly at night and that you have limited aircraft options get a medical exam though you can start your training without a medical exam it s a good idea to get one straight off the bat if it turns out that you aren t eligible to fly you won t waste money starting your lessons you will need to find an aviation medical examiner near you to set up a physical to be able to fly in the united states you have to receive at least a third class faa medical certificate 3 x research source at the exam you will be asked your medical history along with any medication you take regularly you will get an regular physical exam and be asked to provide a urine sample if you are over 40 you will be required to take an ekg which tests for problems with electrical activity in your heart you also will need to pass an eye exam clear out time in your schedule getting your license will take time so prepare to be working on it for around six months depending on your schedule clear out at least one day a week during which you can take lessons or study if you jump into the process without a clear schedule it s easy to either get overwhelmed or to lose focus know what kind of aircraft you want to fly before taking lessons decide whether you want to learn to fly an airplane a helicopter a hot air balloon or a different type of aircraft most new pilots choose to learn to fly an airplane with a single engine but you have a few different options find the right instructor you want to find an instructor that is experienced at both flying and teaching and can communicate well try to find an instructor who has done more than 3 000 hours of teaching 4 x research source the easiest way to find an instructor is through a flight school in your area though some flight instructors do work freelance also be sure to pick an instructor that you feel at ease with flying for the first time is nerve wracking as it is so you want to find someone who will make you feel relaxed and calm start your lessons your flying lessons are the most critical part of your learning process different countries vary on the amount of time that you need to train so check your country s individual standards by researching on the internet or calling a flight school no matter what country you are in you will need to do a certain amount of hours with your instructor plus night and cross country flights as well as solo flights with takeoffs and landings in the united states the breakdown is as follows 5 x research source 20 hours of training with an instructor including 3 hours of cross country 3 night hours and 3 hours of instrument flight training 10 hours of solo time including travel to various airports with set amounts of takeoffs and landings although this only adds up to 30 hours you need 40 hours in the us to complete training most people do more than 40 hours a good estimate of the average amount of hours people generally do is 60 hours this is the amount of time that it generally takes to master all the skills you need 6 x research source fly consistently don t take long breaks between your flying sessions even a couple weeks can make you forget what you have learned so that you will have to do more hours to master flying this will cost you more money and make the entire process longer and more difficult 7 x research source let your instructor know if you need to repeat lessons on certain skills you will be learning many different aspects of flying when you learn so much at one time it can be difficult to retain it all if there is an aspect of piloting that you feel uncertain about tell your instructor that you d like to go over it again your instructor is there to help so don t be hesitant about asking them to repeat themselves some of the skills and knowledge you will learn are airport operations preflight procedures takeoffs and landings navigation flight at various air speeds stalls night operations and emergency operations 8 x research source ask your flight instructor for resources you will need to study to gain enough knowledge to pass your tests there are study guides out there for people training to get their private pilot s license which is a good way to start but you should make sure to ask your instructor for good resources your instructor has experience getting people through their training and testing and may know the best and latest resources out there to help study flight procedures in addition to practicing flight procedures in your lessons it s a good idea to study them on your own time different people have different ways of learning and many people benefit from having information presented in several different ways 9 x research source reading about what you have been learning in your lessons will reinforce the knowledge so that you will have a better chance of remembering the skills and information study aeronautics to get your private pilot s license you have to pass not only a flying test run but also a knowledge test the knowledge test includes a written and oral exam that will test your aeronautical knowledge some areas of study you will need to explore are aerodynamics aircraft systems aeronautical decision making how to read weather forecasts and reports and planning for the unexpected during flights 10 x research source take classes if you are having a hard time learning all of your ground knowledge at home or are confused about what to study consider enrolling in a class taught by a flight instructor this class will be specially formulated for providing the information you need to know to safely fly and also to pass the written test 11 x research source take a practice written exam you can find practice written exams either online or through your school taking these tests will let you know what you can expect from the real thing score your test and take note if there is a particular area of study you need to brush up on go over this subject before you take the real test take the written exam when you are confident you are ready take the written test in the united states the written exam has 60 questions and must be completed within two and a half hours you must get at least a 70 to pass the exam 12 x research source the written exam is offered in seven different aircraft categories airplane helicopter gyroplane glider hot air balloon gas balloon and ligher than air gas ship depending on what aircraft you have taking lessons on the exam usually runs for 90 in the united states 13 x research source take the oral test the oral test comes right before you take practical flight exam for this test the examiner will give you a specific hypothetical flight route and ask you plan the details including things like the time enroute the navigation the fuel burned etc you also will go over aeronautical knowledge that you have studied 14 x research source do the practical exam after the oral exam you will be asked to act as pilot in the practical examination you will be asked to start a cross country flight then plan a course to a nearby airport this will test your ability to plan on the spot and improvise which is an essential part of flying as conditions are constantly changing 15 x research source no matter what keep your focus and don t get distracted some examiners may purposefully try to distract you to see if you have the level headed temperament needed to fly the cost of the practical exam in the united states usually run between 300 and 400 16 x research source maintain your license congratulations you earned your private pilot license keep it in the back of your mind that every couple years you must complete another quick oral exam and check in make sure that the person giving you your license has told you the specifics for maintaining

how to become qualified to fly a plane,if you re thinking about becoming a professional pilot or just want to know what it takes to become one here is how to complete a successful flight you can get instruction by going to a flight school at your local airport or joining a military training program note many of the details on this page apply to the us only,pick up a copy of microsoft flight simulator or laminar research s x plane it doesn t have to be the latest version if your computer is older flight simulators will help you learn about the instruments and systems found in a typical trainer aircraft as well as make you familiar with maneuvers and procedures you will need to master for your private pilot exam thus you will need to spend less time and money on actual flight lessons which are quite expensive x plane s website truthfully says that if a flight simulator can save you an hour with a controller it will have effectively paid for itself remember that while flight simulators are good for procedures training they won t give you all of the stick and rudder skills to fly a real airplane 1 x research source check out weather products such as metars and tafs even on days you don t fly see if conditions match what those products indicate that way when you do fly you ll have a higher confidence in the weather predictions raise the nose of the airplane by pulling the control wheel toward you this will make the airplane climb or stall if you pull back too far pitch changes speed power changes altitude 2 x research source use the throttle control to help the airplane climb and control your speed push the control wheel away from you and reduce power to descend 3 x research source turn the control wheel left to raise the right wing this will cause the plane to bank resulting in a left turn you also need to add left rudder the left peddle to keep the plane coordinated same thing to turn right but use the right controls your instructor certified flight instructor cfi will probably charge for time on the ground as well as in the air this is not just a way for the cfi to generate more income if used wisely you will become proficient more quickly than by just flying for example if you study your intended flight prior to the flight lesson you will optimize the time you spend with your cfi by having smarter questions and clearly understanding what you are going to do additionally you should receive a thorough post flight debrief even if everything went picture perfect as you progress in your training these pre and post flight debriefs should get shorter 4 x research source get your class iii medical it s relatively simple to pass if you re in good health no use starting sometime if you have a health condition that will preclude you from flying www faa gov has the info to help you determine if you have any health exclusions 5 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to fly a cessna 310,now that you have mastered the single engine aircraft it s time to advance and get your multi engine rating the following steps should provide enough information to help you pass your multiengine exam flight test and get your multiengine certificate these steps provide a realistic and achievable guide this article focuses on taking you through all the basics of the instruments in a cessna 310 one of the most common light twin aircraft to be illustrative of all similar types of aircraft if you would rather begin by flying the cessna 172 single engine plane visit fly a cessna,learn the differences between the cessna 172 and the cessna 310 the obvious difference is not just that the 310 has more controls to operate the engines it also has many more features in all parts of the aircraft covered later a first glance inside the cockpit at the 310 panel will reveal many more instruments and controls and more modern ones get to know the additional instruments added to the 310 instrument panel two tachometers two manifold pressure gauges two sets of engine temperature and pressure gauges notice the center pedestal with dual controls become familiar with the added controls in the 310 the most noticeable difference for this article is in the dual control pedestal the controls from left to right are two throttles two propeller controls two fuel mixture controls two fuel tank controls under the pedestal learn the twin panel differences this panel has the newer glass panel which has all the instrumentation of the six pack panel but concentrated into one glass panel in a different format where airspeed and altitude are in vertical bar displays note that three round gauges below the glass panel were kept for backup in case of glass panel failure airspeed indicator artificial horizon altimeter remember the three critical speeds there are a few more critical speeds to worry about in a twin memorize these speeds you are sure to be asked about them in the oral test these speeds vary with each aircraft check in the manual of your aircraft vmc 93 knots minimum control speed the airspeed below which the aircraft cannot be controlled in flight with one engine out vyse 106 knots best rate of climb the speed giving the best climb on one engine vxse 95 knots best angle of climb the speed giving the best climb to clear a 50 feet 15 2 m airport departure obstacle on one engine understand the faa multiengine rating requirements some of the faa requirements are as follows have your instructor show you the current list you must currently hold at least a single engine pilot s certificate must have a minimum of 10 hours of flight time with an faa qualified flight instructor in a twin engine aircraft must have made at least 5 take offs and landings in the last 90 days in a twin sufficient training to master flight with one engine shut down ground training in performing a more complicated pre flight walk around know all the special speed and other requirements with operation on both engines and with one engine off pass an oral exam with an faa inspector in all the items above pass a flight check with an faa inspector demonstrating all of the above become familiar with the walk around the walk around is more complex on a twin the following is an example of most check items use the checklist from your aircraft manual remove all control locks internal and external if installed check condition of elevator rudder trim tabs hinge bolts and actuator rods check static pressure holes for obstruction check baggage compartment and door check ailerons in same manor as elevator check main and auxiliary fuel tank filler caps are secure check landing gear for damage check engine oil minimum 9 us quarts 9 000 ml full 12 quarts drain some fuel from strainer and check for water or contamination check main landing gear tire and gear door secure check propeller and spinner for nicks or scratches check oil filler cap check cowl doors secure check nose gear check pitot tube for obstruction check taxi light be sure to perform the same checks both sides of aircraft remove tie downs perform before takeoff checklist use your aircraft check list landing gear switch in down position before turning power on elevator and aileron trimmed for takeoff check throttle friction knobs for proper friction set mixture to full rich prop controls to full forward set flaps at recommend position some use 10 degrees check your manual do not confuse flap switch with landing gear switch fuel selector valves set to main tank carburetor heat to cold full forward check fuel gauges for sufficient fuel boost pumps on controls free and movement correct cowl flaps open check your fuel the following procedures are just an approximation of what to expect your instructor may show you but not as an exact procedure for following without an instructor check all 4 fuel gauges for full tank if appropriate the 310 has 4 fuel tanks two 50 gal wing tip tanks and two 15 gallon 56 8 l aux tanks giving you a possible range of 1000 miles the total fuel weight is 1170 lbs so beware of over loading the aircraft you may have to leave some fuel behind start engines if in a clear area follow your aircraft manual start the left engine first since the battery is located there start the right engine check both engine instruments in the green altimeter set to field elevation gyros set doors and windows properly locked seat belts on including passengers no passengers allowed until getting your multiengine certificate perform engine run up a 310 run ups will be the same as a complex single engine run up per engine check magnetos carburetor heat prop controls per your 310 aircraft manual calculate the start stop runway required before taking off from any airport in any aircraft calculate the required runway length for your aircraft fully loaded see your aircraft manual with a multiengine aircraft you have to check not only the required runway length but the start stop distance for your aircraft start stop distance is the distance required for this aircraft to accelerate at full speed to vmc then bring the aircraft to a full stop on the runway the distance should be approximately 2400 feet of runway in the average 310 some pilots like to double this number to 5000 feet and use that as the minimum runway for this aircraft single engine service ceiling of a later model turbo 310 is approximately 17000 ft but an early model 310 is only about 7700 ft check your manual and memorize your maximum service ceiling best not to land at an airport elevation above 7000 ft if you have an early model 310 start your takeoff roll apply both mixture controls to maximum or as stated in your manual apply both propeller controls to maximum or as stated in your manual apply both throttle controls to maximum or as stated in your manual stay on runway centerline with rudder as required verify max propeller to be at least 2600 rpm or as per manual check engine gauges are in the green as required watch airspeed for vmc velocity minimum control do not rotate until vmc 96knots or as required establish best rate of climb if you need to clear a 50 ft obstacle use best angle of climb maintain best rate of climb 106 knots establish stabilized climb at 106 knots verify rate at least 500 fpm vertical climb indicator once positive climb is established gear up ease flaps up if any flap used maintain climb at 25 inches manifold pressure at 2400 rpm until reaching desired altitude level off at cruise altitude lower nose slightly and reduce power throttle to 23 inches manifold pressure set prop control to 2300 rpm for best cruise power of 65 power maintain this power setting and hold altitude with small adjustments of yoke and throttle trim as desired to maintain cruise altitude demonstrate engine out recovery you ll be tested by an faa inspector on engine out recognition and recovery have your instructor walk you through engine out procedures first at a safe altitude the instructor will show you how to tell which engine failed and how to fly the aircraft on one engine the instructor may kill one engine when you least expect it you ll have to demonstrate your ability to perform the following procedures recognize the loss of one engine the cockpit will suddenly get a little quieter and the aircraft will yaw in the direction of the dead engine this is more difficult at night practice this at a safe altitude and at night try using a needle ball it may help by showing the sudden change of yaw determine which engine is out first verify the throttles are both on full power both prop controls in full forward and mixtures in full rich some pilots use the dead foot dead engine procedure meaning if the left engine failed you ll have to push a lot of right rudder to fly straight if the left foot isn t needed then the left engine must be dead some say that s simple the prop will stop and the rpm will drop well in actuality the prop continues to spin at the same rpm a windmilling prop has the same drag as a solid disk of the same diameter so you need to get the prop feathered and stopped immediately add full power to the good engine now that you ve identified the dead engine verify full power is applied to the good engine feather the bad engine reduce the drag from the bad engine prop by putting the prop into the feather position prop control all the way back feathering puts the prop edgeways to the wind to eliminate drag and stop the prop from rotating you don t need the extreme drag of a windmilling prop which will cause the aircraft to be un controllable setup the aircraft for the flight on one engine get the aircraft flying straight ahead with no loss of altitude try to maintain straight ahead flight raising the dead engine side wing higher to balance out the good engine power and dead engine drag and yaw conditions always practice dead engine procedures at a safe altitude always hold the dead engine wing high until landing but only if you really have a dead engine prepare for the latest in aviation safety ads b or automatic dependent surveillance broadcast is a cornerstone of next generation air traffic modernization mandated soon by the faa for all aircraft operating in airspace that now requires a mode c transponder must be equipped with ads b this new system when properly installed and operated will allow the pilot to see and be seen and avoid all other aircraft in the vicinity in addition to aircraft traffic in flight services and weather information can also be sent to the pilot in flight,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to become a test pilot,test pilots fly airplanes in development newly developed and retrofitted aircraft to ensure they fly according to design specifications and the standards of the airlines or militaries that buy them while test pilot connotes a daring occupation the work of a test pilot requires knowing when and when not to take risks if you re looking to become a test pilot here s what you need to know,obtain a class i medical certificate student pilot certificate before running off to flight school and spending money on flight training be sure you are physically eligible for a career as a test pilot if you cannot pass a class i medical test you cannot work as a test pilot period this means being off of most if not all medications never having had an epileptic seizure never having had internal organ issues especially with the heart never having had a history of mental issues involving psychosis no criminal convictions no illicit drug use and a host of other criteria that may be referenced in the far aim and a number of websites your first class i medical certificate may be dual issued with a student pilot certificate become a professional pilot find your nearest far part 141 ground school and enroll in flight training part 141 is preferred to part 61 because of its more stringent testing criteria aircraft certificates from private pilot to airline transport pilot atp are required as well as instrument and multi engine ratings in addition a variety endorsements and type ratings may be obtained in order to expand a test pilot s resume proficient and safe operating habits and good stick and rudder skills are a must have a background in and passion for science most if not all aircraft manufacturers require an advanced degree in aeronautical engineering for test pilot applicants this means starting early with mathematics and physics courses in high school and obtaining a bachelor s and master s degree in aeronautical engineering or a bachelor s in mathematics or physics with a minor in engineering and a master s in aeronautical engineering expect a minimum of 6 years in a university and a lot of hard work if your goal is to enter the military talk to officer recruiters and join your university rotc program be able to communicate well verbally and in writing test pilots spend as much time planning their test flights and reporting on how the plane handled after flying it as they do actually flying planes they work with engineers before the flight and are often called upon to make suggestions to improve a plane s design during its development phase based on the results of their test flights you need to be able to understand and use the correct terminology in oral and written reports and engineering papers go to test pilot school or join the military at this point being a professional pilot and an aeronautical engineer you stand an excellent chance of obtaining a pilot slot in the marines navy or air force just be aware that the cut off age for military pilot entrance is typically 27 years while at your university you should be in communication with local officer recruiters and be sure to fulfill their criteria which typically includes gpa requirements as well as physical fitness tests being able to pass the naval flight physical is a must if entering the marines or the navy going the civilian route is more difficult a test pilot certificate from the national test pilot school costs around 500 000 for the average person still deep in college debt this is impossible to become a purely civilian test pilot you must find a company to sponsor your entrance into test pilot school be on your best behavior be sociable and never burn bridges because the aviation community is a very small place network as much as possible and make sure you cultivate the image of a determined safe and brilliant pilot and eventually you will find the connection and sponsorship you are looking for go to conventions where you can meet other pilots in the industry including test pilots shake hands talk goals and exchange email addresses these connections are extremely valuable and can give you tips on company openings and requirements in order to land a seat at test pilot school,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to attend flight school,becoming a commercial or private pilot takes dedication money and hundreds of hours of hard work fortunately there are a number of different paths you can take as a prospective pilot to achieve your goals if you want to go to school full time and get your pilot s license as quickly as possible you can enroll in a part 141 school or an airline cadet program if you want to hold a job while going to flight school you can attend a part 61 school to maintain flexibility another way to get flight training is to complete military service,pick a part 141 school to finish your training quickly and efficiently this type of school is generally reserved for people who can go to flight school full time and intend on making a career out of flying part 141 schools all use the same curriculum and have a fast paced rigid structure to get students certified 1 x research source the benefit to enrolling in a part 141 school is you can finish the training within 1 year depending on how well you do in the program choose a part 141 school if you have gi bill benefits if you have gi bill benefits you can use them to pay for a good chunk of flight school you can pay for 60 of the flight training through the benefits saving thousands of dollars in the process 2 x research source you cannot pay for a part 61 school with financial aid from the government complete 190 hours of flight training in a school approved aircraft part 141 schools have more restrictions than part 61 schools and follow their syllabus to a t you ll need to do at least 55 hours of flying with an instructor as well as 65 hours of flying by yourself at minimum 3 x research source a part 141 school can only give you credit for 25 of the hours you compile outside of school that s why it s important to fly in a school approved aircraft take on site exams to graduate from part 141 school part 141 school s offer on site tests and structured class schedules the classes are lecture based and after going to class for 3 days a week you can take faa licensing tests to get through the program at a part 141 school instructors will always be on hand and ready to help 4 x research source these centers have computer labs for test taking as well as airport facilities choose a part 61 school to maintain a flexible schedule part 61 schools are for people who want to learn how to become a pilot while also working a separate job these smaller schools allow you to set your own pace and learn the material in your own way you can train around your other job and spend more time focusing on specific areas of flight school as needed 5 x research source depending on how quickly you move through the material part 61 schools can take years to complete take part 61 courses at your own pace you can take all part 61 classes online and knock out the material at your own speed there isn t a ground school requirement meaning you can study the information at home 6 x research source you can also work with a private instructor to go over the material at a part 61 school it isn t how you learn the information it s that you learn it well earn flying hours outside of school part of a part 61 school s flexibility is that you can fly various aircrafts and put those hours towards your total that said part 61 schools require more hours than part 141 schools for a private certification you need at least 40 hours in the air for a commercial certification you need 250 hours of flying 7 x research source expect to spend much more time in the air than the minimum requirement you ll need the extra hours to get as comfortable as possible with the aircrafts pick your own flight instructor part 61 schools allow you to choose your own flight instructor to complete training if you know someone in the field reach out to them and ask if they have time to train you part 141 schools already have faculty in place so you wouldn t have the same flexibility when it comes to picking your instructor 8 x research source independent flight instructors can be tough to find if you don t already know someone if you re having trouble finding an instructor speak with your school to see if they have any contacts enroll in jetblue s airline cadet program if you have zero experience some airlines offer cadet programs to train potential pilots themselves for example jetblue has a program called gateway select which takes people with zero experience and teaches them how to be a pilot in 4 years the best part of this schooling is that jetblue offers jobs as first officers to those people who complete the program you must be at least 19 years old to enroll in the program 9 x research source this route is more expensive than part 141 or part 61 schools the total cost of jetblue s program is 125 000

how to plan and perform a vfr flight,vfr visual flight rule flying is something every pilot must learn and every successful pilot must perfect it s getting in tune with the aircraft discovering its attitudes and movements navigating and avoiding obstacles and other aircraft the pilot in command pic of any aircraft is responsible regardless of outside instruction most importantly because a vfr pilot needs to keep visual reference with the earth it is crucial to know and understand when it is and is not safe to fly under weather regulations minimal being vmc visual meteorological conditions that said this is a simple guide to planning and performing a safe vfr flight happy landings and keep your nose up,be qualified before flying before flying a pilot must be qualified and hold the proper licenses or have a flight instructor lined up though excitement may get the best of a pilot s he must carefully review the pilot operating handbook poh obtain a weather briefing to ensure the entire duration of the flight will be within vfr minima and review the procedures for problematic situations in flight every pilot should plan for accurate food rations survival gear and appropriate clothing for the outside conditions including life jackets if going beyond gliding distance from shore prepare for emergencies reading and understanding the aircraft s poh can be essential in recovering from a bad situation it s much easier to follow steps already memorized than to shuffle through the book in panic safety is paramount ensure you are familiar with the procedures with regards to engine failure during take off engine failure in cruise rough engine uncertain of position being lost fires electrical failures etc plan your flight flight planning has a fairly unvarying process though the results and information will be unique every time a pilot needs to calculate the plane s gross weight and recognize if the centre of gravity is within limits this will change the airplane s performance an improperly balanced plane is an impending accident navigation for vfr flights are suited with vnc vfr navigation chart and vta vfr terminal area chart maps with indications for gravel pits golf courses waterfalls etc for location reference as well as airspace information terrain elevation and airport information vtas are larger scale maps giving more detail on arrival and departure procedures a pilot shall check out any outstanding notams notices to airmen prepare a chart and flight log file a flight plan and ensure s he will have sufficient daylight on arrival without night rating perform a walkaround the pilot of any flight should be thoroughly aware of the airplane s condition and must bring anything of concern to the mechanic or instructor on site the walkaround gives the pilot an opportunity to check for any sort of tainted exterior surfaces being bugs ice frost dirt etc as well as fuel and oil checks the importance of determining the airworthiness of an airplane cannot be underestimated frost on the wings of an airplane alone can lower the lift efficiency by 30 and increase drag by 40 walkaround checks include draining fuel samples to check for contamination ensuring there s an adequate amount of fuel for the flight as well as checking for the quantity of oil in the engine every aircraft has a checklist for the walkaround starting inside the cockpit ensuring all paperwork first aid fire extinguisher etc are there and intact lastly the pilot checks that foamies remove before flight tags and tie downs are detached preflight it s common to have everything planned out and ready to go and then have the weather to start to sink get a current weather report a professional responsible pilot will realize that if the conditions aren t right you don t fly be patient for calmer days during the preflight stage the pilot shall check to have the aircraft operating manual log charts computer pencils survival equipment clothing and sunglasses in the aircraft now that the groundwork is done the pilot may call atc air traffic control for a transponder code transmission responder for airplane recognition on radar screens passengers may be briefed at this point as well take off a pilot should avoid intersection take offs many runways require an airplane to backtrack onto to make use of the entire length of the runway keep lift off speeds and engine failure procedures in your mind and have an abort location about halfway down the runway if all systems aren t a go at that point check that the engine sounds good and the propeller is rotating at full power read and complete the checklists ensure temperature and pressure gauges are showing good readings if there is an air traffic control atc unit the pilot must request clearance for take off always use the centre line of the runway and devote all attention to the task at hand know your duties in flight a pilot has three priorities when they are flying to aviate navigate and communicate and in that order once settled in a cruise flight attitude a pilot should read his her map and follow it to the ground anticipating landmarks as outlined with vfr flight a pilot must stay below 500 from the cloud base in controlled airspace so as to have clear visual contact at all times on a cross country flight the pilot or co pilot should be calculating the fuel burn and ground speed as per the pre flight plan when the tanks are down to 30 minutes of flight time during the day or 45 minutes at night the pilot should plan to land and refuel prepare for arrival prior to arriving at the destination the pilot has several things to think about and coordinate about twenty minutes before landing the pilot should review the canada flight supplement cfs to reconfirm the airport information circuit height elevation runway lengths and heading and review the approach speeds crosswind limit and flap settings about ten minutes before the pilot shall broadcast their current location intentions and get the local traffic information if there are several airplanes arriving atc will let the pilot know of their sequence number for landing between five and ten minutes prior to landing the pilot should set the altimeter to the reporting station s pressure check surface winds and continue to look for other traffic if the crosswinds are over the limits the pilot should land elsewhere landing lights will be switched on and at this point the pilot may join the circuit after reporting checking the windsock is important so the aircraft is landing into the wind for sufficient engine cooling and greatest drag land landing is a critical point in any flight pilots must be able to recognize where the airplane will land from the point at which s he is in the air presently when undershooting or experiencing turbulence add power early check and recheck the windsock as the aircraft gets closer to the runway and review the overshoot procedure it s safer to go around again or ask for an alternate than to have a bad landing line up with the white centre line of the runway and stay lined up during the approach touchdown and rollout plan to have the airplane touch down by the first third of a paved runway first quarter if grass apply brakes right away if required a small aircraft may be able to roll itself out to a slow on the remaining runway length shutdown the flight was successful and everyone is safe passengers must remain seated until the prop s have stopped the pilot has the responsibility to close the flight plan as soon as possible so search and rescue sar doesn t get alarms telling them the aircraft hasn t arrived on time also make sure the emergency locator transmitter elt hasn t activated hard landings may have the elt go off without there being an accident or reason to investigate if the plane is low in fuel it is of common courtesy to refuel it for the next flight it also helps eliminate water accumulation in the wing tanks keeping the fuel pure lastly the pilot should tie down the plane put in wheel chocks insert foamies and replace remove before flight tags,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to become a flight trainer,professional pilots can choose to become instructors after years of experience in the united states the federal aviation administration faa monitors and certifies all pilots and instructors you will be required to prove your flight hours take a written test and take a practical test ground flight instructors deliver lectures and assign textbook reading to teach the theory of piloting aircraft later they use flight simulators and accompanied flights to deliver further experience find out how to become a flight trainer,obtain pilot certification flight instructors must first be certified pilots before training others you can enroll in an faa certified flight school as soon as you are 16 you will be required to have at least 250 flight hours before you can get your commercial pilot certification these hours are with a licensed flight instructor some other types of flying such as helicopter require a lower number of flight hours undergo a medical examination all pilots are required to pass a medical examination before being licensed apply for pilot ratings throughout the career most pilots apply to receive advanced pilot ratings in order to move up the ranks with their chosen aircraft complete 5 years of experience as a professional pilot although this is not strictly necessary for all types of flight commercial pilots must have 1 500 hours of commercial flight experience in order to apply to become a flight instructor it is always a good policy to spend 5 to 10 years working in an industry before becoming a full time flight instructor choose the type of aircraft on which you would like to instruct many of the tests are plane specific such as sport helicopter glider airplane or gyroplane to become an airplane flight instructor you will need to show flight hours for single and multiple engine aircraft consider enrolling in a flight instructor training course these courses often last approximately 2 months and train you in over 150 hours of ground and flight instruction these courses will allow you to shadow other instructors and you may be given job placement upon completion call the faa to schedule a ground instructor or flight instructor examination call 800 947 4228 to schedule an examination with the computer assisted testing service cats you will be required to take a written test of between 25 and 100 questions if you fail a flight instructor test you may be required to submit a report of your test failure and proof of additional instruction apply for jobs as a flight instructor most instructors begin by teaching ground instruction and then moving on to flight instruction in some cases you may be required to write your own instruction course and materials,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to become a helicopter pilot,becoming a civilian helicopter pilot in the united states is an expensive goal but an achievable one everyone who wants to fly and is not receiving military training must earn a private helicopter license if you would like to become a professional helicopter pilot you will then go on to earn a commercial license after that you will focus on logging hours in the air the more you have the more qualified you ll be,turn 16 you need to be at least 16 years old to obtain a private helicopter license you need a private helicopter license before you can get a commercial helicopter license once you have your private helicopter license you ll need to be at least 17 to obtain your commercial helicopter license visit the doctor all pilots have to pass a medical exam provided by an faa approved physician you can be disqualified if you have any health problems that might imply the risk of lapses in consciousness these could include heart problems psychological disorders or a history of drug abuse your hearing and vision will also be checked as well as your ability to perceive color students with poor color vision may be prevented from becoming pilots pilots need to distinguish colors in order to understand light signals when operating a helicopter if you think you may have poor color vision ask your optometrist to administer a test before you begin pursuing a career as a pilot if you are worried about being disqualified for any of these conditions talk to an faa approved medical examiner about your concerns find an faa approved medical examiner on the faa website study up you do not need to graduate from college to fly a helicopter but having a degree can make it a lot easier to find a job most employers require you to have at least an associate s degree and prefer a bachelor s if you know you want to fly helicopters for a living consider going to college for math physics or aeronautical engineering helicopter pilots need to know algebra geometry trigonometry and calculus there will be math questions on the test and you will need especially good math skills to fly commercially you can take math classes at your flight school or aeronautical college you can also study with books and study guides look for guides written specifically for pilots save or take out a loan getting civilian training is expensive flight schools will require you to provide some proof of funds before you are admitted you can expect to pay 10 000 15 000 for the training it will take to pass the helicopter pilot certification exams plus 18 000 20 000 for commercial certification flight time with an instructor costs approximately 200 an hour for time flying solo you might pay around 160 1 x research source the tests themselves must be taken through an faa approved testing company the written exams will run you between 200 to 300 the flight exams cost roughly 500 if you choose to take out a loan you might want to look into a career training loan if you are already a pilot with a fixed wing license you can apply for a rotorcraft add on license and you will not be required to fly as many hours to qualify for it there are few scholarships available for students of rotorcraft there is a non profit called whirly girls that provides women who have already gotten their private pilot certification with scholarships to help them achieve a commercial private pilot certification 2 x research source pick the flight school that s right for you you can find flight schools listed at the faa website before you choose ask yourself where you want to be employed as a helicopter pilot in the future if you want to fly in a mountainous area you will get more practice if you go to a flight school in a mountainous area opt for schools that can boast of a high graduation rate and good job placement for graduates to be admitted you will need to have passed your medical examination you will also need proof of funds and a high school degree or equivalent prospective rotorcraft students whose first language is not english must pass the toefl exam consider attending a college or a university that offers an aviation program that way you can get your associate s or bachelor s degree at the same time that you obtain your helicopter licenses get your flight experience in flight school you will learn all the controls and maneuvers used to fly and land a helicopter you will use simulators at first then fly helicopters with an instructor before qualifying for your private license you will do at least three hours of dual cross country flying three hours of dual nighttime flying and three hours of solo cross country flying you will perform one 75 nautical mile cross country flight and perform three solo takeoffs and landings dual flight time happens when you are flying the helicopter accompanied by your instructor solo flight time is when you are the sole occupant of the helicopter though you may receive radio communications from your instructor on the ground you will not begin flying solo until your flight instructor thinks you are ready 3 x research source your first solo flight is a milestone of your training pilots call it soloing take your private license exam once you have amassed 40 hours of flight experience including at least 10 hours as pic you can take your private license exam you must score at least 70 percent to pass your written exam this exam has 30 50 questions your flight exam will require you to answer questions and perform maneuvers you have learned in your flight lessons if you fail a portion of it you may be allowed to retake that part of the test your exams will mostly be comprised of questions about rotorcraft and flying you will be asked to identify functions of different parts of aircraft quizzed on which moves to make during different crises and asked to figure out simple points of procedure study by taking the practice exams available at the faa site take your commercial license exam once you have passed your private license exam you must fly 150 solo hours before you qualify for your commercial helicopter license if you are only interested in flying as a hobby you do not have to get this license if you are looking to work as a pilot you will need to take the commercial license exam this exam is similar to your private license exam but includes an oral component and a check ride during your exam your examiner will ask you to plan a flight they will ask you follow up questions about conditions and procedure after or during this part of the exam you will pilot a short flight with your examiner beside you if you make an error your examiner can choose to fail you forcing you to take the entire test again or pass you on the condition that you retake the section you failed once you have successfully demonstrated flying ability flight knowledge and good judgement you will pass consider becoming a commercial flight instructor to get an introductory pilot job you will likely be required to have between 500 to 1000 hours of experience piloting a helicopter you will not have amassed that many hours in the process of obtaining your commercial rotorcraft license that will only have taken you 150 hours to become a flight instructor however you are only required to have 200 hours you can earn the hours you need to land a pilot job and get paid to do so by flying as an instructor 4 x research source pay for more hours because most jobs require more hours of flight experience than you will accrue in flight school you might have to pay for more hours if you do not becoming a commercial flight instructor you can expect to pay about 160 dollars an hour for solo flight time with a private instructor prepare a resume your helicopter pilot s resume will list your hours of flight as well as your education and work experience include the aircraft you are familiar with and any awards you have achieved from your flight school or the faa ask your flight school for help making a professional looking resume or look for templates online apply for work some industries you might enter include offshore support fire fighting law enforcement agriculture pipeline and utility support sightseeing executive transport fishing logging ems emergency medical services and search and rescue check the requirements for each job posting to

how to fly a helicopter,ever dreamed of piloting a helicopter flying a helicopter or rotorcraft requires a different set of skills than flying an airplane although there are some similarities while an airplane depends on forward motion to move air over the wings and create lift a helicopter creates lift using rotating blades you need both hands and both feet to fly a helicopter this guide can help you on your journey as a helicopter pilot,familiarize yourself with the helicopter components and controls 1 x research source read your individual aircraft s operating handbook here are some of the basic controls you ll need to know to operate the helicopter 2 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source the collective is the lever mounted on the cabin floor to left side of the pilot s seat the throttle is the twistable grip at the end of the collective the cyclic is the stick located directly in front of the pilot s seat the tail rotor is controlled by the two pedals on the floor also known as anti torque pedals 3 x research source understand the helicopter s capabilities and limitations the majority of accidents are caused when the rotor system gets overloaded most usually this occurs when pilots attempt maneuvers that require lift in excess of what the rotor system can produce or power plant can provide 4 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source operate the collective control with your left hand 5 x research source raise the collective to make the helicopter rise and lower it to make it go down the collective changes the main rotor s blade angle collectively the main rotor is on top of the helicopter adjust the throttle as you raise the collective you need to increase engine speed decrease speed as you lower the collective throttle is directly linked to the position of the collective lever so that the rpm is always in line with the collective setting you will only need to make adjustments when necessary operate the cyclic control with your right hand the cyclic is similar to a joystick but sensitive so make very small movements 6 x research source push the cyclic forward to move forward back to move backward and to either side to travel sideways the cyclic does not change the direction in which the front of the helicopter points but it does cause the helicopter to tilt forward and back pitch or to the right and left roll operate the tail rotor pedals with your feet these two pedals or anti torque pedals control the direction in which the helicopter is pointing more or less having the same effect as the yaw pedals in an airplane 7 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source gently increase pressure on the left pedal to swing the nose left or increase pressure right to swing the nose right the yaw pedals increase or decrease the force that the tail rotor produces thereby controlling the yaw without a tail rotor to counteract main rotor torque the helicopter will naturally spin in the opposite direction of the main rotor take off 8 x research source follow these steps to perform a standard takeoff first open the throttle slowly until you reach proper operating rpm pull the collective gradually up as collective pitch increases push the left pedal right pedal for clockwise rotating main rotors continue pulling on the collective and depressing the left pedal adjust the pedal if the aircraft is turning to the left or right the helicopter will leave the ground and you ll be able to use the cyclic as you continue to pull the collective and depress the pedal adjust the cyclic to level the aircraft as you take off push forward slightly to start moving forward as the helicopter transitions from vertical to forward motion it will shudder and the nose will pull up push the cyclic forward a little more to make sure you keep going forward the phenomenon that causes the shudder is called effective translational lift etl 9 x research source as speed increases the rotor blade lift becomes more effective it is important to anticipate for this phenomenon and correct for it as you progress through etl reduce the collective lever and apply less pressure to the pedal push the cyclic forward to avoid an abrupt nose high attitude and reduction in forward speed once you ve taken off slightly release forward cyclic pressure the aircraft will then begin to climb and gain airspeed from this point the pedals are primarily used to trim the aircraft most maneuvers will only require a combination of the cyclic and collective controls hover by finding a balance between the collective cyclic and tail rotor controls 10 x research source learn to do this with an instructor who can operate the other controls while you practice them 1 at a time and then in combination you must learn to anticipate the time lag between when you adjust the controls and the helicopter s reaction climb and descend using speeds according to your pilot operating handbook this will vary depending on terrain maintain 15 20 knots during a steep climb carefully increase collective and be sure not to exceed the yellow limit of the torque gauge 11 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source land taking care to always have your landing target in sight normally slightly to your right pilots side this may mean that you have adjust your trim so you are turned slightly to one side as you approach 12 x research source try to be around 200 500 feet 61 0 152 4 m above ground or any obstacles when you are 5 kilometers from your landing area watch your airspeed at around 2km from the landing area slow the aircraft to 40 knots and begin to descend check your descent rate be careful not to let your vertical speed go over 300 feet 91 4 m per minute vertical speed can be adjusting by applying the necessary amount of collective as you approach the edge of the landing area gradually slow to 30 then 20 knots you may need to bring the nose up to decrease airspeed doing so will momentarily obscure your sight of the landing area keep moving forward when you get to the landing area since it s much harder to control drift and land on the target if you hover first once the spot you want to land appears to slide beneath the nose of the aircraft you can then reduce the collective arm the parking brake ease the cyclic back to reduce momentum and then forward to level the altitude keep rate of descent as low as possible adjust the collective appropriately once you have made contact with the ground check that your parking brake is

how to charter a local helicopter company,make a grand entrance or make a quick getaway chartering a helicopter is cheaper than you think and a lot faster and more predictable than other travel,search for helicopter charter on the internet or in a telephone directory set up the appointment expect to pay around 500 for a three passenger helicopter and 1800 for a 5 passenger helicopter depending on the distance you have to go sometimes it will be much more effective to make two trips in the smaller helicopter depending on the distance scout a good landing area make sure there are no wires because these are the biggest problem for a helicopter trying to land alert your chosen company as to where any wires are situated and realize that the company will make the final decision on where to pick up and land large fields or parking lots are best parking decks are great too even better are those with lights get landowner permission to land the helicopter and get it written on a piece of paper this is a requirement for the faa and most likely many other air traffic authorities in your part of the world count on a 15 minute window of timing and realize that these are highly mechanical devices that have weather constraints they can fly around thunderstorms but not at night for example wait for help to get in when entering the helicopter the pilot will assist you do not slam the doors shut they work with a simple close and a pin very unlike a car door put away problem items scarves gloves sunglasses camera cases and cellular phones are dangerous when introduced to a tail rotor make sure they are under control before you approach the helicopter in the summertime just keep them pocketed expect that the doors may be open during flight this is for your comfort as there is seldom air conditioning ask ahead of time and expect to pay a slight premium for air conditioning if you desire it keep calm if there is a lack of doors this will not be a problem just keep your arms inside because the wind is four times the speed than that of your car you can easily dislocate or injure your arm wind will not be an issue wind is designed to slip around the aircraft not into the cockpit,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to calculate flight time,keeping track of how long you were in the air is important if you re planning any flights especially those that are international many sites will automatically calculate flight times for you taking any delays into account but you can also find flight times by hand by understanding time zones and doing some simple math,visit a website that tracks travel times search online or on your phone s app store for digital flight calculators look through the options to see if they include features like selecting the type of aircraft or wind speeds 1 x research source some options to choose from are flight time calculator or airplane manager type in the airport codes for where you re departing and arriving find the 3 letter travel code for each airport for the city you re traveling to enter the codes in the appropriate text boxes so the site can estimate the time 2 x research source some websites will allow you to search for airports by the city name rather than the specific airport name use the live setting to calculate wind speeds flight times can vary depending on if the plane is traveling with or against the wind click on the drop down menu or button so wind speeds are taken into account for the calculation 3 x research source if you re not tracking the time of a current flight some websites have a seasonal option so you can get an estimate on wind speeds in different seasons click the calculate button to see the estimated flight time after you enter all the information on the site click on the calculate button the results will calculate the approximate time the flight will take along with the distance the flight will travel 4 x research source know that the time listed is only an estimate the actual flight time could take longer or shorter depending on wind weather or delays note down the departure and arrival times write down the times on a sheet of paper using the local times for the airport for example if you depart from new york city you would write the time as it was in the eastern time zone if you land in california you would list the time as it was in the pacific time zone 5 x research source arrivals and departures posted at the airport are usually in the time zone for the local airport convert the times so they are in gmt greenwich mean time or gmt is the standard time in london and never changes for daylight saving time every other time zone is behind or ahead of it depending on how far west or east you travel respectively 6 x research source for example new york city is 5 hours from gmt if you depart at 6 am add 5 hours to convert it to 11 am gmt the state of california is 8 hours from gmt so if you arrive at 9 30 am you would add 8 hours to get 5 30 pm gmt find the gmt times for each time zone online or use an online calculator to help you calculate the difference in arrival and departure times count how many hours are in between the estimated arrival and departure to get an estimate of how long you will be in the air if you re using military time simply subtract the time you depart from the time you arrive 7 x research source for example if you leave new york at 11 am gmt and arrive in california at 5 30 pm gmt you would be in the air for 6 hours and 30 minutes know that the flight time is an estimation since it does not account for any wind or severe weather,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to make a drone,drones are small remote controlled aircraft you can pilot yourself there are many kinds of drones you can build and operate but a simple quadcopter is the easiest to build and control for beginners a simple drone is a great way to get started learning about how they work and practice piloting them before moving up to more expensive and complex platforms,find a quadcopter design in a book or online for reference there are many websites and books devoted specifically to building your own drone the most common kind of home built drone tends to start with an x shape that allows you to mount 4 rotors called a quadcopter this design is easy to build and is used even on high end drones 1 x research source having a design to follow will help make it easier to decide where best to place each component once you ve finished a quadcopter drone you can try larger designs that incorporate more motors to carry more equipment like cameras many drone designs are available for free online if you search diy drone design make a frame for the drone out of metal plastic or wood begin constructing your frame using the material of your choice model plastic balsa wood or thin metal thinner than 25 inches 0 64 cm are best for a simple quadcopter design lay one 12 in 30 cm long piece of wood plastic or light metal across another so it creates an x shape with 90 degree angles each extending arm of the drone frame should reach toward what would be the corner of a perfect square you could draw around the frame choose a frame material that is at least 1 inch 2 5 cm wide to support mounting your engines 2 x research source you can purchase model plastic thin metal or balsa wood at most hobby or model stores you can also find these materials at drone retailers or on websites like amazon use glue or duct tape to secure the two pieces of your frame together don t move on to the next step until the pieces of the frame are secure and any glue you ve used has dried purchase motors propellers and other electronics from a drone retailer there are some components of your drone that can t be built from scratch so you ll need to purchase them if there is no drone retailer nearby many hobby stores that carry model rockets and r c airplanes will carry them 3 x research source you will need to purchase speed controllers a power distribution board and a flight controller along with the motors and propellers if you have trouble finding the parts you need many drone specific online retailers as well as large retailers like amazon carry these parts drone engines should be rated to produce a total of twice as much thrust as the drone weighs if your quadcopter will weigh 800 grams 28 oz each engine should produce 400 grams 14 oz so the combined total amount of thrust will equal 1 600 grams 56 oz you can often buy these components in bundles drill holes in the frame to support the motors most motors mount using anywhere from 2 to 4 screws place one motor at the end of one of the drone s extended arms and make marks where the holes need to be drilled then use those holes to guide you when using the drill 4 x research source if you are using self setting wood screws on a wood or plastic frame drill the holes smaller than the diameter of the screws so they can work as a guide if you are using metal drill holes of the same diameter of the mounting bolts you ll use you will then need to use nuts on the underside of the bolts to secure them in place cut 4 5 in 1 3 cm rings from a 4 in 10 cm pvc pipe to make landing gear lay the pipe on its side and mark it where you ll make your cut then use a saw to cut all four sections so you re left with 4 plastic rings made of pvc pipe 5 x research source these four rings will serve as lightweight landing gear for your drone the cuts don t have to be perfect as long as the rings are thick enough to be sturdy but the better the finish on your cuts the better the drone will look stand the landing gear rings on their side and attach them with duct tape place one ring on its side beneath each arm of the drone s frame then use thin strips of duct tape to secure the rings to the arms the drone will now stand on its own on your table 6 x research source you can use glue instead of tape but make sure it s completely dry before moving on keep the rings in the middle of the arms so they don t interfere with the placement of your motors or other components mount the motors on the frame place each motor over the holes you drilled for them and then use screws or bolts to secure them in place then slide the propellers over the posts extending from the top of the motors and screw the caps that came with the motors over the top of the posts 7 x research source the drone frame now has landing gear and motors but the center portion of the frame should still be empty tighten the bolts or screws securely so the motors can t wiggle at all on the frame any slack will create vibrations that can make the drone unstable use zip ties to secure the speed controllers to the bottom of the frame the electronic speed controllers that connect to the motors should be mounted on the underside of the drone frame to prevent it from getting too top heavy when you add the rest of the components zip ties are an easy way to attach them run the zip ties through the mounting loops on the speed controllers or just across them and over the frame then pull the zip ties tight so the controllers are firmly held in place 8 x research source don t use glue the first time you assemble your drone as you may find you want to adjust the positioning of different components based on how it flies the speed controllers regulate how fast the motors on the drone spin this ensures all four motors spin at the same speed so the drone will be level as it flies secure the battery to the frame consider the size and shape of your battery when looking for the right place to mount it if it s flat you can mount it in the center of the drone and then mount other components on top of it if not you may want to mount the battery on the underside of the drone along with the speed controllers 9 x research source in most applications mounting the battery in the center of the top of the frame is the best place use zip ties to hold the battery in place so you can remove it and move it if you need to adjust the weight distribution of the drone later install the power distribution board center the power distribution board on the drone frame on top of the battery if you placed it there as well connect the lines from the speed controllers and the battery to the board once you ve zip tied it down 10 x research source the power distribution board relays the right amount of power to each component to keep the drone operating smoothly attach the flight controller to the drone frame with zip ties and connect it the flight controller relays information from the remote control to the power distribution board position it on top of the power distribution board and then zip tie it down 11 x research source refer to the instructions for the flight controller and power distribution box to connect them properly but in most applications the connection will be one clearly marked wire that plugs directly from one into the other buy a wireless remote control system that works with your flight controller ask for help at your local hobby store or drone retailer to make sure to choose a remote control system that works with your specific flight controller often you can buy them in bundles but if not the remote control system will list the flight controller systems it is compatible with on the box choose one that lists your flight controller 12 x research source the remote control system will come with the remote control itself that you ll use to pilot your drone check to see if your system takes off the shelf batteries or is rechargeable you ll need to power it to connect it to your flight control system connect the motors to the speed controllers run the wires from the motors to their respective speed controllers on the underside of the drone s frame so power can be transferred into the motors once you power the drone up while these connections may vary from brand to brand they are usually a simple male female connection that just needs to be pressed together 13 x research source if your components don t have a simple connector refer to the instruction manual for the speed controller to assess the best way to connect them you may need to solder the wire directly to a port on the motor itself if so check the manual for the motor as well to ensure you re soldering the wire to the correct port charge the drone battery use the power supply that came with your battery to plug it into a wall outlet leave it plugged in until it reaches a maximum charge usually four hours but refer to the instructions that came with your battery to check for your specific application 14 x research source you ll need the drone s flight controller powered to connect it to the remote control system many drone operators choose to purchase and charge multiple batteries as each one will only power the drone in flight for a few minutes before needing to be recharged again link the remote control system to the flight controller follow the instructions that came with your remote control system to establish a link between the remote control and the flight controller mounted on the drone 15 x research source on many applications this connection is easy to establish simply hold the sync button on both the remote control and the flight controller while they re near each other and the two will link up fly your drone in the air turn on both the drone using the switch on the flight controller and the radio control drone controls usually have at least two joysticks the left stick controls the yaw or the direction the drone is pointed by moving left to right and the throttle by going forward and backward the right stick controls the roll left to right and the pitch pointing the nose down or up 16 x research source use the left stick to control speed and direction use the right stick to control the orientation of the drone leaning left or right angled up or down,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to become a drone pilot,with a little practice piloting a drone can become second nature if you just want to fly one for fun all you need to do is learn how to control it and follow laws that regulate drone use however piloting drones commercially is a rapidly growing industry and you could turn your hobby into a paycheck in order to operate a drone commercially in the united states you ll need to get a remote pilot certification from the faa federal aviation administration,register your drone if it weighs more than 0 55 pounds 250 g in the united states you must register a drone that weighs between 0 55 pounds 250 g and 55 pounds 25 kg with the faa registering your drone online is simple https registermyuas faa gov you ll be prompted to register a new account by entering your email address and creating a password you ll receive a verification email with a link after clicking the link you ll enter your information and agree to faa safety guidelines then you ll receive a registration number you only need 1 registration number even if you have multiple drones you ll need to fill out a paper form to register an unmanned vehicle over 55 pounds 25 kg 1 x trustworthy source federal aviation administration u s government agency responsible for monitoring and setting guidelines for civilian aviation go to source in addition you ll need to apply for a special exemption in order to fly it exemptions are rarely given to those without a pilot license 2 x research source start practicing with a toy drone if you ve never flown a drone before practice with an inexpensive toy before trying to fly a vehicle that cost hundreds or thousands of dollars you wouldn t want to risk damaging an expensive model once you ve gotten a feel for the controls and can maneuver a toy move on to a more advanced model 3 x research source go for a toy under 100 us with a separate transmitter the remote control that mimics larger more advanced models don t practice with a toy operated by smartphone most inexpensive toy drones weigh less than 0 55 pounds 250 g and don t need to be registered when you re ready to upgrade choose a drone that fits your needs and budget battery life is key so look for models that can fly for 20 to 30 minutes most consumers want drones with cameras but models with good quality video cameras cost a minimum of several hundred dollars you can find drones with lower quality cameras for around 250 4 x research source learn the controls transmitters that control drones come in all shapes and sizes but they all feature basic universal controls 5 x research source the left thumb stick controls throttle or propeller speed and yaw or the direction the drone points push the thumb stick forward and backward to increase and decrease the throttle push it left and right to rotate the drone clockwise or counterclockwise the right thumb stick controls pitch and roll push it forward and backward to adjust the pitch and move the drone forward or backward push it left and right to control the roll and turn the drone left or right remember that when the drone is facing you the directions are switched think about when you and another person face each other from your perspective their right arm and leg are on your left side take off by pushing the throttle forward with gentle pressure push the left thumb stick forward to open the throttle keep applying pressure until the drone rises off of the ground practice slightly increasing and decreasing the throttle to get a feel for how it causes the drone to lift higher and lower 6 x research source don t lift the drone any higher than eye level when you re just starting to practice you ll engage the throttle constantly while the drone is in the air hover by making slight adjustments with both sticks the drone will hover when you engage the throttle but you ll probably find that it starts to waver try making small adjustments with the right stick until the drone steadily hovers without wavering while it s hovering rotate the drone by turning the left stick to the right for clockwise rotation or left counterclockwise 7 x research source experiment with the controls to get a feel for what happens when you move the sticks in different directions make slight adjustments instead of pushing the stick as far as you can practice flying straight in square patterns and in circles once you get the hang of hovering push the right stick slightly forward to move the drone forward then push it backward to move the drone back push it forward right backward and left to fly the drone in a square try pushing the right stick diagonally to the upper right corner then gradually rotating it clockwise to fly the drone in a circle 8 x research source while you practice flying and turning the drone s height might decrease increase throttle by pushing the left stick forward remember to make small adjustments and keep the height low when you re practicing for the first time land the drone by gently pressing down on the throttle to land the drone have it hover by returning the right stick to the center position decrease the throttle by slowly taking pressure off of the left stick when the drone is hovering very close to the ground disengage the throttle to make your landing 9 x research source a soft patch of grass or dirt is a better landing spot than hard pavement always turn off the transmitter when you re done flying follow the faa s unmanned aircraft rules lots of faa regulations apply to drones and you should familiarize yourself

how to control a drone,drones are small mechanical helicopter like devices that can be piloted remotely one of the most popular styles is a quadcopter a 1 ft 0 30 m x shaped drone with 1 small propeller at the end of each arm drones are often equipped with cameras and can be flown over remote areas controlling a drone while it s in the air can be tricky and since they re expensive you d be well advised not to crash a drone start out by keeping the drone well within eyesight and practice simple maneuvers before trying anything too complex,practice piloting the drone in a large open area this is especially important for any drone novices you re bound to make a couple of mistakes the first time or 2 that you fly a drone so avoid flying the machine in forested areas with trees and branches around you ideally try to find an open meadow or field that s at least 200 yards 180 m across so you ll have plenty of obstacle free space to fly in 1 x research source if you re new to flying a drone stick to flying it outdoors in a large open area since many drones can cost as much as 1 500 usd any slight mishap could be very expensive however a number of small toy drones are made to be flow inside once you re an experienced drone pilot you may be able to fly a drone indoors in a spacious and relatively empty room urge bystanders to stand at least 20 ft 6 1 m away as you practice the controls for a drone are sensitive and a tiny tap in the wrong direction could send the drone flying in a direction you didn t intend if friends or family members onlookers etc are nearby they could be in the drone s way so have them keep a safe distance for their own good 2 x research source if a friend gets too close to the drone as it s taking off or landing they could be injured and the drone could be damaged or destroyed press the left stick of the drone s remote control forward to take off as you push the stick away from yourself the propellers will engage and the drone will lift off the speed with which the drone elevates itself will depend on how forward you push the left stick use a gentle touch so that the drone will slowly lift off 3 x research source the left stick of the drone s remote control often also called a transmitter is called the rudder keep slight pressure forward on the left stick to let the drone hover once the drone has lifted off of the ground continue pushing the left stick gently forward to keep the drone at a consistent altitude your drone is now hovering for now keep the drone less than 6 inches 15 cm off of the ground try lightly pushing and pulling on the left stick to see how the drone responds 4 x research source don t touch the right stick of the remote control for now pull the left stick slowly back down to land the drone lower the drone slowly back to the ground when you re ready to set it down when the drone is within 2 inches 5 1 cm of the ground pull the rudder all the way down towards your body this will drop the drone to the ground without damaging it 5 x research source it s worth practicing taking off and landing the drone 3 5 times before you move on to actually flying it if you take off or land too aggressively you could damage the drone fly the drone forwards and backwards by maneuvering the right stick when your drone is in the air and hovering about 5 9 feet 1 5 2 7 m off the ground direct it forward or backwards by lightly pushing or pulling the right stick forward away from your body or backward towards your body pressing the stick forward will send the drone forward and pulling it backward will fly the drone backwards 6 x research source fiddle around with the right stick to see how the drone responds remember that relatively small adjustments can have a large effect on the drone s direction move the right stick to the right or left to tilt the drone in that direction slight pressure on the right stick to the right or to the left will send the drone flying in that direction start by making small adjustments once you gain confidence and experience with the drone you can move the right stick all of the way to the right or left so the drone tilts severely to 1 side or the other and makes more dramatic turns 7 x research source don t quickly shuttle the stick back and forth multiple times in a row or you ll risk damaging the remote control manipulate the left stick to rotate the drone left or right this is another way to turn the drone and one which will keep the drone at more or less a consistent altitude unlike steering the drone with the right stick which causes it to tilt and dip to 1 side or the other turning the drone with the left stick keeps the device in more or less the same spot this is also a useful way to find tune the direction that the drone points in when you re using the camera 8 x research source try combining left right movements on the left stick with forward backward movements to adjust the drone s elevation as you steer it left or right turning the drone left or right in this way is called adjusting its yaw combine movements with the left and right sticks to fly the drone at this point you ll have mastered the basics of drone control as before use the right stick to guide the drone left and right and the left stick to move the drone up and down or to control its rotation 9 x research source keep in mind that if your drone is equipped with a camera the lens will always point forward before you send your drone over the horizon make sure to read the instructions and find out how far the remote control signal transmits and how long the battery lasts depending on the type of drone you re flying the maximum flight distance can range from 1 5 8 kilometres 0 93 4 97 mi most drones have a battery life of roughly 30 minutes rotate the right stick to pilot the drone in a circle for this flight pattern you won t need to touch the rudder to send your drone in a clockwise circle begin by pressing the right stick forward and to the right slowly rotate the right stick so it s pointing only to the right and then circle it back so it s pointing towards your body finish the circle by rounding the right stick clockwise to the left and then forward again 10 x research source once you ve perfected the clockwise circle try flying the drone in a counterclockwise circle you ll use the same steps as presented above but steer the rudder counterclockwise pilot the drone in a square by moving the right stick at right angles start out with the drone hovering slide the right stick forward so the drone flies about 5 feet 1 5 m in this direction then return the right stick to the center then slide the right stick to the right so the drone moves 5 feet 1 5 m in that direction 11 x research source finish off the square pattern by flying the drone 5 feet 1 5 m backwards by moving the right stick back towards you and to the left by moving the right stick to the left practice hovering over specific targets to improve your control to improve your hovering skills line up 3 or 4 objects e g traffic cones each 3 4 feet 0 91 1 22 m apart from one another use the controls to fly the drone over the first object then hold the left stick yaw and elevation steady tweak the right stick until the drone hovers in place then use the right stick to guide the drone over to the next object and again stabilize the drone so it hovers 12 x research source this can be a useful flight technique to use if you re planning to take advantage of the drone s camera if you re filming something on the ground hover the drone directly over it for as long as you like fly the drone at different orientations to prepare for longer flights as you fly your drone at greater heights and farther distances it won t always remain pointing in the same direction so while the drone is sitting on the ground turn it 90 180 or 270 practice lifting off and landing the drone and pilot it in the air until you re comfortable flying the drone as it faces any angle as you steer the drone you ll need to perform some mental adjustments so it goes in the direction you d like 13 x research source for example with the drone rotate 90 moving the right stick left or right will move the drone forward away from you or backward back towards you it might be easiest to start with the drone rotated 180 in this position moving the right stick to the right will cause the drone to turn left and vice versa,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to fly a small drone,small drones are perfect for learning basic maneuvers and techniques without the pressure of a huge price tag before you start flying do a quick check to make sure everything is set up correctly and the space around you is clear to perfect your navigational skills practice basic maneuvers indoors until you ve mastered the basics after that it s time to take your small drone outside and enjoy a fun flight,check your small drone transmitter s range this is important to make sure you don t let it fly out of range and lose it check the limit on the drone s packaging or the instruction manual most manufacturers will list a recommended range and a maximum range so take note of both of these numbers 1 x research source small drones will generally have a much lower transmitter range than medium or large models so always keep your drone close and in sight if you can t find the drone s packaging or manual do a quick google search with the name and model of your drone along with the keywords transmitter range you should be able to find information for most drones online make sure your drone and transmitter batteries are both charged to make the most out of your flight check the batteries first place them on the charger and ensure the charger indicates that they re full secure them back inside the transmitter and drone so that they re connected and securely locked into place 2 x research source most nano micro drones have a full charge of 5 7 minutes while small mini drones usually have a flight time of 20 25 minutes on a full battery 3 x research source these fly times may seem short but they re still very fun you can still cover quite a bit of ground in 5 7 minutes as well remove any small obstacles in the area you ll be flying in as a beginner it s important to practice in a clear open space until you get a feel for the controls move any lamps or chairs out of the room before you begin if there are people or pets in the area you can politely ask them to move or just look for a different space to practice 4 x research source you should also watch out for any breakable decorations such as vases and picture frames when you re flying outside be aware of your surroundings and avoid obstacles such as buildings trees power lines or vehicles turn on your drone and set it down so the back lights are facing you once the drone is on back up a few steps to check the light these indicate that the batteries are working and the drone is ready to fly it s also important to start with the back of the drone facing you so the controls match the drone s movements 5 x research source do this for the first few flights even if your drone can lift off from other places such as tables or your hand turn the transmitter on and make sure it s connected to the drone if this is your first time flying the drone you may need to connect or bind it with the transmitter follow the instruction manual to complete this process which generally requires connecting the drone and transmitter with a cable and holding the bind button 6 x research source if your drone won t connect with the transmitter try holding down the binding button on the transmitter first then turning it on the signal should connect automatically if it still won t connect contact the manufacturer for help start flying inside an empty open room for your first flight get comfortable using the controls indoors this way you won t need to worry about fighting the wind or losing control of the small drone a large open room with high ceilings and as few obstacles as possible would be ideal 7 x research source since small drones are toy sized they re perfect for indoor use generally you wouldn t be able to safely fly a larger class of drone indoors use the left joystick to control the drone s elevation gently push the joystick forward to make the drone go up and back to make the drone go down practice this motion carefully keeping the drone steady without any over corrections 8 x research source make sure to use a light touch just in case the drone is more responsive than you may think if you do over correct use gentle nudges to return the drone to a neutral stable position push the right joystick to control the drone s direction move the joystick carefully to the right to make the drone move horizontally to the right and vice versa for the left then practice pushing the joystick up to make the drone move forward horizontally or down to make it move backwards horizontally 9 x research source maintaining balance can be tricky so try to use soft motions until you re familiar your drone s sensitivity practice taking off hovering and landing set the small drone on a flat surface then use the left stick to lift the drone until it takes off raise it so it s hovering at least 1 ft 0 30 m in the air and use your throttle to hold it there as steadily as you can after a few seconds bring it down gently to land on the flat surface practice this until you have it down 10 x research source give it a little extra throttle right as you land to make it extra smooth work on hovering and stabilizing your small drone this will be especially important once you practice outside since the breeze can easily carry small drones along practice taking off and gently guiding the drone laterally with the right joystick then come to a stop and hover in place 11 x research source if the drone wanders make corrections by gently nudging the drone in the opposite direction make sure to keep your corrections slow and gentle if you turn the drone hard you could lose control of it practice making some gentle turns with the right joystick while hovering gently push the right joystick to the left and right to get used to the feeling of turning then you can practice turning in a box or circle shape by moving the right joystick to the right then forward then to the left then backward 12 x research source once you ve gotten used to turning practice taking off from a set spot turning a square or circle and then landing on the same spot take the drone outside to a quiet open area fields and quiet remote parks are great spots for practicing your drone flying skills avoid large obstacles such as power lines buildings and trees as well as people and animals this is especially important when you re just starting out make sure there s no one in the area where you ll be flying before turning your drone and transmitter on and practicing your skills fly on clear days with little to no wind for the best conditions small drones are especially susceptible to being carried away by gusts of wind so clear fair weather is ideal avoid windy stormy weather which can interfere with the signal between the remote and the drone or even carry your drone out of its transmitter s range if a storm or heavy winds start to roll in while you re flying you should bring your drone immediately use your controls to balance the drone against light wind even on a clear day a little breeze can still affect your small drone s balance notice how the light wind pushes your drone then compensate by applying a little pressure on your joystick in the opposite direction this will help your drone balance and stay stable generally you can expect the breeze to affect the drone s horizontal direction as well as its ability to hover in one spot expect at least 5 7 minutes of flying time before the battery dies different drone size classes all have a different flying time but the minimum amount is about 5 7 minutes for nano micro drones 13 x research source pay attention to your drone s battery life and make sure to bring it back in before the time runs out 14 x research source the fly time tends to goes up with the drone size so if you buy a mini small drone your fly time will likely be a little higher don t fly your drone over water in case it falls the majority of small drones don t have the advanced water landing system that larger more expensive drones do be mindful of the landscape while you re flying and use your controls to direct your drone away from any bodies of water you should especially avoid flying out over large bodies of water such as rivers lakes and oceans,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to fly an rc quadcopter,remote controlled drones have become all the rage in recent years but they re anything but children s toys even a standard consumer grade quadcopter is a sophisticated and expensive piece of technology that comes with a bit of a learning curve before you take to the skies make sure you ve familiarized yourself with the drone s basic mechanics after that it will be a matter of getting comfortable behind the controls and learning to perform simple maneuvers that will help improve your skill reaction time and spacial awareness,find a safe open place to practice the best place to practice is a spacious field survey your area for public parks sports fields and outdoor recreational areas until you come across a suitable takeoff point grass is also a major plus for first time flyers since it will cushion crash landings in the event that something goes wrong 1 x research source stay away from concrete until you re confident in your piloting skills all it takes is one fall to tear up your drone beyond repair wherever you end up make sure it s somewhere outside whizzing a drone around in an enclosed space is a recipe for accidents 2 x research source watch out for potential obstacles avoid flying your drone near power lines flocks of birds unleashed dogs vehicles and other people getting too close to any one of these obstacles could leave you with a downed aircraft 3 x research source other people may consider it rude if you fly your drone in their personal space the wind can become a real hazard when it picks up until you ve gained enough experience to counteract the effects of a strong gust it s a good idea to schedule your flights on calm days 4 x research source put new batteries in the transmitter most standard transmitters the remote control unit you ll be using to provide input to the drone require 3 6 aa batteries though some accept a single large battery pack instead fit the batteries into the small compartment in the back of the device then replace the battery cover and make sure it snaps into place securely 5 x research source with brand new batteries you should be able to get 3 5 hours of use out your transmitter you ll know it s time to replace the batteries when the controls begin to respond inconsistently insert the drone battery the power pack for the quadcopter itself will be quite a bit larger typically this battery will slide into a slot on the body of the drone other varieties like long lasting lithium polymer batteries rest on top of the drone and are connected by a series of cables 6 x research source make sure the battery is fully charged before taking your drone for a spin 7 x research source you should also get in the habit of giving the battery some juice after each and every use keep in mind that the average battery life for most drones is only 10 15 minutes you don t want your drone crashing on you mid flight 8 x research source turn on the transmitter flip the power switch on the remote control and look for the power indicator to light up when it does you ll be ready to go 9 x research source if your transmitter features a retractable antenna make sure it s fully extended to give you the range you need the power switch may be located on the faceplate top or back of your transmitter device depending on the model set the drone to your preferred flight mode drones typically have two primary control systems manual and auto level also sometimes called stabilize you can alternate between different flight settings at any time by going to the advanced settings screen in your quadcopter s user hub 10 x research source on the manual setting your drone will remain at the same angle after you apply roll even if you release the thumbstick auto level commands it to correct itself after each adjustment so that it returns to a neutral orientation 11 x research source while you ve got the advanced settings menu open you can also explore other flight settings such as loiter which allows the drone to follow a fixed course automatically altitude hold which keeps the drone at a constant elevation and auto return which signals the drone to head back to its takeoff point should your happen to lead it outside the range of the transmitter push the left thumbstick forward and backward to control the throttle throttle simply describes how fast the propellers are spinning which determines things like speed and lift as you move the thumbstick forward the drone will climb higher and higher releasing it will keep it at a fixed altitude and pulling back will cause it to descend 12 x research source you ll use the throttle to gain height during the takeoff as well as ease the drone down when it s time to land all thumbstick controls are sensitive which means the more you move them the more exaggerated the response will be on some models returning the left thumbstick to its resting position and removing your thumb will cut off the propellers if you re not careful this could cause your drone to drop right out of the air 13 x research source change the pitch with the right thumbstick pitch is what s responsible for actually getting the quadcopter moving when you push the right stick forward the drone will also lean forward and the force of the propellers will push it along pulling back has the opposite effect putting the drone in reverse 14 x research source a slight backward pitch will throw on the brakes when you re cruising along at a high speed roll the drone by using the right thumbstick roll is just what it sounds like any lateral movement will tilt the drone in the same direction allowing it to veer smoothly to one side for the most part roll is the input you ll use to steer the copter 15 x research source rolling too hard may cause the drone to lose a little bit of elevation move the left thumbstick side to side to adjust the yaw yaw is fancy aviation term that basically refers to which way the drone is pointing while pushing the left stick forward or backward will raise and lower the quadcopter tilting it to either side will cause the front end to rotate in that direction if you were to hold it down the drone would spin in circles giving you a 360 degree perspective 16 x research source yaw is most useful while hovering you can use it to scope out the landscape or track a moving object without altering the drone s position 17 x research source knowing how and when to adjust the yaw can be tricky as there s a tendency for it to compete with roll which also changes direction a lot of it will come down to your preferred flying style and what feels most comfortable for you keep your drone within your line of sight at all times when you re first learning to pilot your drone rule number one is don t take your eyes off of it make it a point not to fly beyond your immediate vicinity and don t allow the drone to wander behind the treeline blind hills and corners or anywhere else that blocks it from view if you lose track of it there s no telling where it might end up if you venture out with a friend have them stand a fair distance away they ll be able to help you spot the drone as it gets further from the takeoff position some quadcopters come with built in cameras that allow you to guide them once they leave your line of sight others make it possible to attach a separate camera or smartphone either way you shouldn t rely on these systems until you ve mastered the basic flying techniques using your own two eyes open up the throttle for a smooth takeoff getting your drone in the air is the easiest part just rock forward on the throttle gradually until it leaves the ground remember the more pressure you apply the higher it will go 18 x research source set the drone on a flat stable surface and check to see that you have plenty of overhead clearance before rocketing it upward 19 x research source don t go higher than around eye level or lower for your first few flights you ll receive an up close look at the drone s movements and be better able to visualize your flight path learn to hover using both thumb sticks once you re airborne relax the throttle and make small adjustments with the right thumbstick to hold the drone in place keeping the right stick centered will prevent the drone from advancing retreating or circling around maintain your hang time for as long as you can be sure to give it a shot from different positions and orientations as well 20 x research source achieving a motionless drone isn t as simple as it looks the right thumbstick needs to be in motion constantly to minimize and correct drift 21 x research source after you start to get the hang of hovering try adjusting the yaw in midair this is a simple way to practice controlling both thumb sticks at the same time fly in a straight line in all directions create forward pitch by shifting the right thumbstick forward when you re ready to slow down pull the thumbstick back toward the neutral position pulling it towards you will make the drone backtrack the way it came and leaning it left or right will cause it to strafe or move side to side without turning 22 x research source use the left thumbstick to maintain your altitude while maneuvering you can increase or decrease your speed by making minor adjustments to the thumbstick practice gentle turns to alter your course use the right stick to send the drone into an arc this will require you to manipulate the throttle pitch and roll simultaneously spend some time looping the drone in different directions being careful not to run it into a tree or bank it into the ground accidentally 23 x research source be careful not to move the left thumbstick up or down too much when rolling or you ll throw off your cruising altitude 24 x research source steering is one of the trickiest parts of drone piloting so be prepared to spend many hours trying to get the copter to go where you want it lower the drone slowly for a gentle landing press down on the throttle lightly and let the drone descend in a controlled manner bring it within a few inches of the ground then set it down nice and easy once it touches down safely release the throttle

how to anchor a boat,anchoring a boat properly is important when you want it to remain in position read the following instructions to learn how to safely and effectively anchor your boat be sure you understand the entire process especially the instructions under choosing a spot to anchor before you drop your anchor even if you already have several anchors reading or skimming the section on selecting an anchor will tell you valuable information about when to use each type and how to evaluate anchor rope and chain quality,consider a general purpose fluke anchor a fluke or danforth anchor relies less on its weight than on its design which consists of two flat pointed flukes extending at a 30º angle from the anchor rod this is one of the more popular designs on the market and in soft mud or hard sand has more staying power by weight than any other type 1 x research source 2 x research source however its broad fluked design may prevent it from reaching bottom in a strong current and like most anchors it will have trouble catching on rocks and other hard bottoms aluminum variations of the danforth design such as the fortress have excellent holding power some of these also have adjustable flukes which can be made broader when anchoring in soft mud 3 x research source a large aluminum fluke anchor may make a good storm anchor 4 x research source research plow anchors for areas of high or changing current the plow anchor is named for the plow shaped wedge attached by a swivel to the shaft it is effective in soft bottoms and somewhat better in grass than other lightweight anchors 5 x research source 6 x research source these tend to be heavier than fluke anchors of the same size and thus will set more easily though with somewhat less holding power than fluke anchors 7 x research source the ability of the shaft to swivel in the direction it is pulled without yanking the main anchor makes the plow anchor less likely to unfasten when the boat is pulled a different direction plow anchors have no protruding flukes or pieces that the anchor line or chain can catch on however unless you have a bow roller plow anchors can be difficult to store 8 x research source only use mushroom anchors for light use mushroom anchors look like a disc or dish at the base of the anchor shaft they don t have much holding power but are a good choice for small boats that make short stops in areas with soft ground if your boat is small enough for the size of mushroom anchor you choose it may be your best bet for heavily weeded areas if poking a hole in your vessel is a concern mushroom anchors have no sharp edges and are less likely to damage thin hulled boats such as composite canoes kayaks and inflatables 9 x research source many electric anchors lowered by the push of a button are mushroom anchors research other types of anchors for specialized uses many more types of anchor exist and no single anchor is useful for every purpose grapnel navy or herreshoff anchors are useful for anchoring small boats to rocky bottoms 10 x research source 11 x research source less common bottoms may require specialized anchors for best results such as a claw anchor in gravel 12 x research source use several anchors for different purposes depending on what you use your boat for you ll probably want several anchors of different sizes your main anchor is useful for extending fishing spots and most other purposes an anchor one or two sizes smaller that s easy to deploy and pull up is good for lunch stops and other short breaks a storm anchor one or two sizes larger should be kept around to deploy during rough weather or for overnight stops in addition it s always good to have at least one heavy backup in case you lose an anchor or for situations where it s wise to use two anchors make sure your anchor is the proper weight and size for your boat as well as the proper type of anchor for the bottom of the lake ocean or sea that you re going to be anchoring to 13 x expert source travis lund sailing instructor executive director treasure island sailing center expert interview 24 april 2020 you should always follow the recommendations of your boat s manufacturer when picking anchor size however a rough chart can be found halfway down this page purchase a larger anchor than specified if you have an unusual amount of weight on your boat when in doubt purchase a larger anchor physical size is a more important indicator than weight although both are relevant 14 x research source use high quality anchors anchors are important for your safety and you should buy the best anchors you can afford inspect each anchor for rust uneven or breaking welding lines and other inconsistencies in the metal before purchasing make sure you have deck cleats or anchor rollers suitable for your anchors you may have a bow roller mounted on your boat where you can store and attach your anchor but be aware that each roller is only suitable for specific types of anchors otherwise make sure you have strong sturdy deck cleats to tie the anchor rope onto 15 x research source learn how to pick a nylon anchor line the chain rope or combination of these that attaches the anchor to your boat is called an anchor rode nylon s elasticity allows it to respond well to sudden wind and current changes and a high quality rope is sufficiently strong to use as a rode it is also easy to manipulate and relatively cheap although you should not skimp on quality three stranded nylon rope is most resistant to tears and thus best suited for water bottom purposes but it will become difficult to handle and need to be replaced after it is stiff with salt choose medium lay three stranded rope referring to the number of twists in the strands as it will come apart less easily 16 x research source braided nylon rope is stronger and easier to work with but not a great option for frequent anchor use as it snags or tears from objects on the bottom 17 x research source when you anchor your boat always be sure the rode is free and clear so it s able to run out of the boat cleanly 18 x expert source travis lund sailing instructor executive director treasure island sailing center expert interview 24 april 2020 understand which anchor chain is best to use chain is more expensive and takes more effort to use but won t be fouled by strong currents and helps the anchor drop to the bottom quickly try to find anchor chain with high quality of manufacture and consistent galvanization indicated by a uniform appearance good choices for chain types to use in anchor applications include bbb hi test chain and proof coil 19 x research source make sure the chain s links fit on your boat s windlass which stores the chain and releases it as you drop the anchor proof coil chain has a g 3 imprinted on each link bbb chain is a strong material with small links suitable for small windlasses it is preferred by people who use all chain anchor ropes rather than a mix of rope and chain hi test chain is strong but light use it instead of the others if you d like to reduce weight anchor chain made by north american companies is a more consistent quality than some anchor chains of other countries 20 x research source if you live elsewhere in the world and don t wish to buy an imported chain local sailors or fishermen may be able to advise you consider using both materials an anchor rode formed from lengths of both rope and chain provides some of the benefits and downsides of each but requires an additional shackle joint to keep the two lengths tightly fastened 21 x research source in the end the chain vs rope discussion has many factors involved and you may want an experienced boat owner to help you make the decision if you use an all chain rode it is still a good idea to attach a nylon rope snubbing line to make the rode heavier and more elastic one end of this rope is tied to a bow cleat while a special chain hook tool attaches the other to the chain 4 feet 1 2m or more from where the chain is attached to the bow 22 x research source use rope or chain of sufficient diameter nylon rope should be 3 16 4 8mm in diameter for a craft under 10 3m in length and 3 8 9 5mm for a craft under 20 6m increase the diameter by an additional 1 8 3 2mm for each additional 10 3m in length beyond 20 feet 6 meters 23 x research source 24 x research source chain can be 1 8 3 2mm smaller in diameter than rope would be for that size of boat use your charts and eyesight to choose a good location your charts should tell you the depth of the water and note any designated anchoring locations 25 x research source try to find a location with a flat bottom suitable for your anchor type soft and relatively weed free is usually best avoid areas of strong current or areas open to the weather especially during an overnight stop if you re aiming to end up over a fishing spot or other specific area keep in mind the anchor location should be well upwind of the area your boat will end up measure the depth at that location and check the space available measure the depth of the chosen spot and multiply by 7 this is roughly how far your boat will drift from your anchor 26 x research source if the current or wind changes your boat could swing to the other side of the anchor make sure it has sufficient space in every direction never anchor your boat somewhere where its swing radius will intersect another boat s never assume the other boats have the same anchor line or anchor rode length as you do or that they will drift in the same direction ask other boat owners where their anchors are dropped and how long the rode is if you re not sure the instructions below give you more exact instructions for determining the length of your anchor line circle the possible anchorage location while making depth measurements circle the spot you ve chosen fully taking depth measurements this will reveal any hidden shoals or other obstructions that could damage your boat if it drifts while anchored 27 x research source if you do find dangerous shallow areas you ll need to find another place to drop anchor check the weather and tide information you should know the timing of the next tide and the range of water level between high tide and low tide so you aren t caught unawares if you re staying longer than an hour or two you should check the weather forecast so you re prepared for any high wind or storms 28 x research source consider which anchor to use you should now have a good idea of the nature of your location if you expect high winds or a strong tide or if your anchor coming loose could cause a collision you should use a heavy storm anchor with excellent holding power for most situations your ordinary main anchor or light lunch anchor will do see selecting an anchor for more information in rough circumstances you may need to use one anchor at the bow and a second anchor at the stern only do this if nearby boats are using this method as boats using one or two anchors swing by different amounts and easily foul each other s lines 29 x research source slowly approach the confirmed spot from downwind and stop when over it when you stop the current or wind should push you slowly backward away from the spot this is when you should drop the anchor 30 x research source if the water is calm you may need a helmsman to reverse the engines at idle speed it s better to work out hand signals for start stop more power and less power in advance rather than attempting to shout across the boat 31 x research source determine how much line to let out and cleat it at that point before you drop your anchor determine how much you ll line or rode you ll need then use a cleat hitch to tie it at that distance the term scope refers to the ratio between the length of your rode and the distance from the bow to the bottom your scope should be at least 5 1 but 7 1 is preferable 32 x expert source travis lund sailing instructor executive director treasure island sailing center expert interview 24 april 2020 increase the scope to 10 1 or more for stormy conditions or if your anchor keeps ripping free of the bottom the longer the scope the closer to horizontal your rode is and the more tightly you will be anchored 33 x research source measure from the bow not the water surface if the water is 10 feet deep 3m and your bow is 4 feet 1 2 m above the water surface the total depth is 14 feet 4 2m a typical scope of 7 1 would require 14 x 7 98 feet of rode 4 2 x 7 29 4 m consult a knot guide for sailors or online tutorial if you do not know how to tie a firm cleat hitch only use a shorter scope than listed if you need to avoid drifting into obstacles and cannot find any suitable anchorage spot with more space do not rely on a short scope for rough weather or overnight stays slowly lower your anchor over the bow front of the boat keep the anchor rode tight at first to help you aim the anchor until you feel it hit bottom then slowly play out the rode it should end up in a straight line across the bottom not piled up in a heap that could get tangled be sure to stop the boat completely before you deploy the anchor 34 x expert source travis lund sailing instructor executive director treasure island sailing center expert interview 24 april 2020 be careful to avoid getting your hands or feet caught in the rode which could cause serious injury instruct passengers of the danger and keep kids and animals away don t throw your anchor overboard let it down slowly to avoid fouling your own rope 35 x research source never drop an anchor from the stern unless there is already an anchor holding the bow and you need extra anchorage anchoring from the stern only could cause your boat to capsize after 1 3 of the rode has been let out cinch it off and let the boat straighten your boat will probably turn across the current or wind as you move after you ve let out about 1 3 of the total rode you determined you d use cinch it off and wait for the boat to straighten out this will straighten the rode you ve let out and gently set the anchor into the bottom 36 x research source if your boat won t straighten out your anchor is drifting and you need to try again pick another spot if possible continue to let out the scope and straighten the boat twice more uncinch the anchor rode and let it out as the boat once again drifts backward cinch it again once a total of 2 3 the rode length has been played out let the boat s momentum straighten it out and set the anchor more firmly repeat this process one more time letting out the rest of the rode length you determined was necessary tie off the line around a bow cleat tie the anchor rode firmly around a bow cleat give it a tug to test the anchor is set although be aware it will require further setting as described below if not you ll need to repeat this process try to find a different spot with better conditions it s a good idea to secure the anchor to the boat with a backup secure in case the primary rode were to fail for some reason 37 x expert source travis lund sailing instructor executive director treasure island sailing center expert interview 24 april 2020 check you re anchored using reference points first find two stationary objects on the shore and note their positions relative to each other from your perspective for instance a tree in front of a lighthouse or two boulders a thumb s width apart if you hold your hand at arm s length signal the helmsman to gently start the engine in reverse until the rode straightens then signal him or her to return to neutral the boat should drift back to a stationary position where the two objects you noted appear in exactly the same position relative to each other 38 x research source 39 x research source if the two objects are in different positions and you remained standing in the same spot throughout this procedure you are not anchored and need to begin again try to arrange hand signals with your helmsman in advance rather than attempting to shout across the boat use your engine to give the anchor a final hard set this is called snubbing the anchor and jams a set anchor more firmly into the bottom have your helmsman reverse hard until the rode straightens out then kill the engine check your bearings again as your helmsman does this to double check the anchor hasn t pulled free take compass bearings regularly take the bearings of several objects around you and note them in your log book do this immediately after anchoring and 15 20 minutes after anchoring to make sure the anchor set properly 40 x research source keep checking every hour or few hours depending on how long you ll be anchored gps units often have an alarm setting that will alert you if you drift 41 x research source if you are going to be staying overnight try to find at least one object that will be lit if you can t you should use a gps unit for an overnight stay or

is getting the boat title transferred from the seller s name into your name while the process is fairly straightforward mistakes could result in disputes over the ownership of the boat 1 x research source,gather required proof of ownership in general you ll need your copy of the title for the boat and the title for the outboard motor in some states these may be two separate title documents 2 x research source if you had the boat financed and there is a lien on the title you ll also need documentation for release of that lien from the finance company complete a bill of sale an official bill of sale provides a record of the sale and the amount for which you sold the boat some states require the buyer to present a written bill of sale when they apply to transfer the title 3 x research source even if your state does not require a bill of sale it s still good practice to have a written document recording the transaction in case questions or problems arise later take the bill of sale to a notary public so your signature and the buyer s signature on the bill of sale can be notarized if the transaction is later disputed the document will more likely hold up in court have 2 copies notarized so both you and the buyer have an original fill in the transfer section of the title on the back of the boat title there will be a section to record the transfer of the boat to another person write the buyer s name address and any other information required check with the buyer to make sure the information you have is correct write legibly in blue or black ink sign the title in the presence of a notary to complete the transfer of the title to the buyer you must sign the back of the title below the transfer section some states require your signature to be notarized if there is a space for a notary seal on the back of the title that s an indication that the signature must be notarized if you re unsure you can call your state s boat licensing office to find out getting the title notarized at the same time you have the bill of sale notarized can save you some time and money give the title to the buyer once you ve completed the transfer section on the back of the title and signed it it s the buyer s responsibility to take it to the title office in your state and apply for a new title you may want to make a photocopy of the title before you hand it over so you have it for your records this might come in handy if for example the buyer misplaces the title before they get a chance to go to the title office accompany the buyer to the title office until the buyer applies for a new title the boat is still in your name if you go to the title office with the buyer you can make sure the buyer gets their new title promptly 4 x research source if there are any questions or problems with your title you also have the opportunity to clear those problems up immediately if you re there in person have the seller sign the title before you can have the title to your newly purchased boat transferred into your name the seller must fill out the transfer section on the back of the title and sign it some states require titles to be signed in the presence of a notary if there is space for a notary seal on the back of the title don t let the seller sign it until they re in front of a notary otherwise the signature will be invalid request documentation from authorized representatives some sellers may have an authorized representative such as an attorney or dealer complete the title transfer for them 5 x research source an authorized representative should have a contract power of attorney or other document that makes it clear they are the legal authorized representative of the title owner of the boat if the representative cannot produce documentation don t go through with the sale it might not be legitimate contact the title owner of the boat if possible have the seller accompany you to the title office having the seller with you can help you avoid a nasty surprise if you find out there is some sort of problem with the title or the record of ownership for the boat 6 x research source with the seller by your side most problems can be cleared up immediately for example the title may have a lien on it the seller could produce a release of lien document to prove that they owned the boat free and clear when they sold it complete an application for a title each state has a title application form that you must fill out with your name address and other information regarding the boat you ve just purchased the information you provide will be used to issue your new title 7 x research source some states also require you to present a written bill of sale for the boat if you re buying the boat from an individual you may want to call your state s boat titling office in advance and find out what documents you ll need make sure all information about the boat is exactly the same as the information on the original title this ensures a clean transfer of title pay any required taxes and fees when you submit your title application to the title office you ll typically be assessed taxes and fees on your purchase these taxes vary widely among states it s a good idea to call ahead and find out how much you ll have to pay as well as what methods of payment are accepted 8 x research source some states don t assess taxes on casual boat sales sales between two private individuals however you ll still have to pay a fee to have the new title issued typically around 15 or 20 receive your new title in some states you ll get your title immediately after you submit your application and pay the fees however many states will give you a temporary document and send your official title in the mail if you have to wait for your official title find out if you can still register your boat with the temporary document you won t be able to take the boat out on the water until it s registered,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to drive a pontoon boat,a pontoon boat is a great option if you like to relax on the water do water sports or go fishing these boats have a wide flat bottom giving you more room on the boat to lounge walk and sit driving a pontoon boat is not too different from driving a v bottomed boat but the difference in shape requires a few adjustments start by learning how to pull away from the dock with ease and navigate open waters you should also know how to dock the pontoon in the slip or parking spot so it is safe and ready for your next boating adventure,make sure all passengers are wearing life jackets before you move the boat at all check that all your passengers are wearing life jackets or another personal flotation device or pfd 1 x expert source travis lund sailing instructor executive director treasure island sailing center expert interview 24 april 2020 in most states it is the law that all passengers wear life jackets while on open waters the life jackets should fit properly and be in working condition 2 x research source children should be wearing specialized jackets meant for their age groups you should also have a cushion on the boat that you can throw to someone in the water in the event they are in distress check the fuel level and the radio on the boat make sure you have a full tank of gas in the boat as this will ensure you can drive the boat on the water safely you should also have a working radio system on the boat that you can use in the event of an emergency 3 x research source make sure you also have your cellphone fully charged on hand so you can call for help or assistance if needed secure all equipment on the boat check that items like fishing rods wakeboards coolers and extra life jackets are all secure before starting the boat you may use bungee cords to secure wakeboards and fishing rods you can also push coolers against the sides of the boat so they are secure 4 x research source start the motor and allow the boat to idle for 1 5 minutes turn the motor to on let the boat idle for several minutes so it can warm up check the manufacturer s instructions for the exact idle time needed for your boat 5 x research source trim the motor so it is in the water but not too deep the trim is how deep the motor on the boat sits in the water there should be a trim button on the throttle make sure the button is set at a higher number so the motor is just in the water this will make pulling out of the dock much smoother 6 x research source you can also check the manufacturer s instructions to see what the trim button should be set at on the throttle for pulling out of the dock never pull out with the motor trimmed all the way up as this will cause the boat to kick up water and could damage the engine the motor should be touching the water when you pull out have a crew member untie the deck ropes as you put the throttle in reverse ask someone on the boat to lean over the sides and undo the deck ropes so the boat is no longer tied down as they release the deck ropes gently shift the throttle in reverse so you can back out make sure the person has regained their balance and is sitting firmly in the boat before you reverse the boat 7 x research source move the throttle slowly and with ease do not pull it in reverse too quickly as this can cause you to lose control of the boat back away slowly by pushing the throttle in short controlled bursts look around you and behind you to make sure there are no obstructions such as another boat or an animal then back out of the dock slowly using short controlled bursts on the throttle back out until you do not have any obstructions or boats in front of you or around you 8 x research source turn the steering wheel so the bow points in the direction you want to travel you want your bow to be facing into the wind as this will help the boat to navigate smoothly in the water 9 x research source shift into forward and move the throttle forward increase your speed in increments until you are cruising at a reasonable pace do not push down on the throttle hard and move off too quickly as this can cause you to those control of the boat 10 x research source always make sure you check that there are no obstructions in front of you before you move forward keep the motor trimmed downward once you are in open water adjust the trim button on the throttle so it is at a lower number this will trim the engine downward deeper into the water trimming the engine downward will prevent the bow from rising too high when you get going on the water 11 x research source keep one hand on the throttle and the other hand on the steering wheel as you drive the boat this will make it easier for you to maintain the trim and steer the boat look 100 feet 30 m ahead at all times be aware of your surroundings when you are in the boat scan the water ahead as you move forward use the side and back mirrors on the boat to check for any obstructions behind or to the side of the boat this will ensure you are not at risk of hitting another boat an animal or driftwood in the water 12 x research source before you make any turns or reverse the boat double check your surroundings first maintain equal weight on the bow and the stern make sure there are people sitting or standing on the front and the back of the boat when you are moving in the water if you have to accelerate or increase your speed check that there is equal weight on the bow and stern before you accelerate so the boat is not at risk of flooding 13 x research source when the boat is idle in open water the weight distribution is not too much of an issue ideally it should be equal on the bow and stern as much as possible cruise at 4500 rpm or slower remember that boats do not have brakes so you will need to maintain a cruising speed that is not too fast most pontoon boats should be kept at 4500 rpm in open waters you can cruise at a lower speed if you want to conserve your fuel at around 3000 to 3500 rpm 14 x research source a good rule of thumb is to accelerate gradually and maintain a speed that you feel you comfortable at you should feel like you can easily slow down the boat at the cruising speed if needed plan your turns in advance turning a pontoon boat can be tricky as the stern can fly sideways if the turns are too sharp look ahead in front of you and plan out your turns so you can make them in a gentle sweeping motion 15 x research source planning out the turns will also help you to avoid making sharp or sudden turns turn the boat downwind at a medium speed the wide shape of a pontoon boat can make turning into the wind difficult as the boat may push against the wind and not get very far you can turn more effectively by pointing the bow of the boat downwind away from the direction of the wind so the wind can help the boat to turn smoothly 16 x research source make sure you are at a medium speed when you turn the pontoon turning at a very slow speed or a very fast speed can cause the boat to slide warn your passengers before you make a sharp turn sometimes when you are driving the pontoon boat you have to make a sharp turn sharp turns can cause the boat to lean and rock due to its shape before you make the turn let your passengers know so they can make sure they have braced themselves against the boat or they are sitting in a secure position 17 x research source for example you may yell sharp turn coming or this turn is sharp so your passengers have enough of a warning slow down when you see the dock shift the throttle so you reduce your speed gradually as you spot the dock and move the boat towards it make sure you follow the harbor rules and slow down to the set speed limit around the dock or harbor accelerate downward and shift into neutral as you approach the slip do not approach the slip at a fast speed as you risk hitting the boat on the dock maintain a slow even speed so you have just enough power to maneuver the boat into the spot 18 x research source turn the wheel so the center of the bow is pointing at the middle of the slip draw an imaginary line in an arc from the center of the bow to the middle of the slip try to keep your boat on this imaginary line as you turn the wheel if the boat drifts to the left or right of the line lightly move the wheel so it stays on the line 19 x research source shift to forward as you turn as you turn the wheel gently shift the throttle forward so you can ease into the slip let momentum do most of the work so the boat can glide into the spot 20 x research source shift into reverse to make small adjustments if you end up slightly crooked or to one side in the slip shift into reverse and turn the wheel slightly to make adjustments try to get the center of the bow lined up with the middle of the slip as much as you can 21 x research source be aware of the wind and the current as you make adjustments as they can affect the movement of the boat try move with the wind or current so you can straighten out the boat properly have a crew member jump on the dock and use the ropes to adjust the boat if you are struggling to park the pontoon ask a crew member to hop out and grab ahold of the ropes on the boat then have them help you by dragging the boat into place using the ropes 22 x research source direct the crew member as needed so you can get the pontoon straight in the slip tie the pontoon up on the dock once the pontoon is properly docked in the slip use the ropes to secure the pontoon to the dock use a cleat hitch or a bowline knot to tie the boat to the dock so it stays in place 23 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to paint an aluminum boat,if you want to give your aluminum boat a fresh coat of paint there are some simple steps you can take to ensure the paint job looks great sand the boat to create an even surface and use soap and water to wash any dirt off prime the boat so that the paint adheres to the surface easily and you can spray roll or brush the paint onto the boat applying a clear coat once the paint is completely dry will help protect all of your work,lay plastic or paper over your workspace to prevent paint stains find a spot ideally outdoors where you can paint your boat without damaging any other surfaces or items spread out a large piece of plastic or several layers of paper to cover your entire work surface choose a spot far away from any buildings cars or other things that might get damaged if paint accidentally gets on them place the boat off of the ground to easily reach it you ll need to be able to paint all around the boat so it should be set above the ground you can prop the boat up on something like sawhorses so that you can paint it more easily 1 x research source sand the boat to remove old paint and create a smooth surface you can use an electric sander or regular pieces of sandpaper whichever you have access to use 40 or 80 grit sandpaper sanding the inside of the boat before flipping it over and sanding the exterior 2 x research source sanding the boat may result in small scratches in the aluminum which is normal wash the boat using soap and water dip a hard bristled brush in soapy water and use it to scrub off any sanding debris or leftover dirt rinse the entire boat off with a hose or you can power wash the boat if desired 3 x research source if the boat is super dirty dip a towel or sponge in a cleaning solution and scrub it over any tough spots dry the boat thoroughly the boat will need to be completely dry before it can be primed or painted use a towel to dry the boat quickly or let the boat air dry 4 x research source if it s sunny outside opt for letting the boat air dry this will ensure that there aren t any damp spots when you go to paint it find a primer that s suitable for metal surfaces priming the boat will help protect the surface while also helping the paint stick to the boat look for a self etching primer that works on aluminum at a home improvement store or online 5 x research source you can mix a little bit of paint thinner with the primer to help conceal any tiny scratches in the metal if desired oil based primers are often used when painting aluminum apply the primer to the interior of the boat in an even layer you can spray the primer on or you can use a roller or paint brush apply it in an even thin layer to the inside of the boat making sure to get all of the cracks and corners 6 x research source if you re spraying the primer onto the boat make sure the area is well ventilated allow the primer to dry before priming the exterior how long the primer takes to dry depends on the specific type and the environment in which it s drying but wait several hours before flipping the boat over prime the outside of the boat just as you did the inside spreading the primer in an even layer 7 x research source leave the entire boat to dry for 10 12 hours or overnight this gives the primer enough time to completely dry before you start adding paint if you primed the boat outside you can leave it outside to dry as long as the weather is supposed to remain clear 8 x research source if it s supposed to rain bring the boat into a garage or shed making sure to still keep it propped up apply your desired water resistant paint to the boat s interior you can choose any color that you like just make sure that the paint is made to withstand water use a sprayer paint brush or roller to apply the paint to the inside of the boat just as you did with the primer 9 x research source make sure you paint all of the seams in the boat well as these tend to chip the easiest let the paint dry before painting the exterior of the boat check the instructions on the container of paint to see how long it takes the paint to dry but it s best to leave the boat untouched for at least 10 hours once the interior coat is dry flip the boat over carefully and start painting the outside use slow even strokes when painting and cover the exterior evenly 10 x research source let the first coat of paint dry completely before you paint a second coat if necessary paint a second coat of the paint if desired once the first coat is dry you can apply a second coat of paint to the interior and exterior using the same painting tools a second coat will help ensure the paint job looks even and it will provide another layer of protection for your boat 11 x research source leave the boat to dry overnight before adding a clear coat set the boat up overnight inside if the weather will be poor so that the paint has time to dry completely use a roller or paint brush to spread the clear coat over the interior and exterior of the boat using thin even strokes leave the boat propped up until it dries 12 x research source you can find a protective clear coat that will help prevent scratches and weather related damage at a home improvement store or online once the clear coat is dry it should help protect your aluminum boat for up to 10 years,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to name and letter your boat,buying boat lettering is easy the hard part is deciding on the boat name for your watercraft pick a name that creates the mood and personality you wish to convey,choose a name carefully if you have ever owned a boat or have planned to buy one you ll ultimately have to name your boat and purchase boat lettering it is seemingly an easy step but you ll soon find naming a boat is far from an easy task for most of us there are a few basic things you should know ahead of time boat lettering comes in two basic types painted on boat lettering is generally done by a local lettering artist preferably one with boat lettering experience the quality of the lettering will depend on the experience of the craftsman and his brush if you decide to have your boat lettering hand painted a marina is a great place to start not only will you see many examples of how others have displayed their boat name you might also ask the marine operator for a few references for your own painted on project 1 x research source more popular now is computer fabricated vinyl boat lettering which can be made at many local sign shops and hundreds of places on the web there s no shortage of vendors that can make boat lettering for you picking one of them is the easy part the real task at hand is deciding exactly what you will be naming your boat take your time and give your boat a really great name conventional wisdom might be to grab a list of the most popular boat names and simply pick one of them and head down to your boat lettering vendor that would be great if you want to be just like the other 500 or so boats in your state sharing the same name the 10 best boat names from whatever list you find should be your blacklist of boat names to avoid think about the name picking your boat name should be something you take time with don t settle for the very first thing that pops in your mind here are the key components you should consider when picking a boat name 2 x research source decide on the personality of your boat fishing boats have a much different personality than cigarette style boats it wouldn t make much sense to name a racing body boat with a hook and sinker type of name like well hook and sinker for example is there anything special about your boat such as an unusual story behind the purchase of it or possibly something unusual about yourself for example i know a guy that has flipped his speedboat twice and the same number of times he had to recover the boat from the sea bottom he named his boat sunk twice there is no doubt it is truly a unique name and it s even a story in itself but is it a good boat name i m sure his drinking buddies adore the name but if you plan to invite your neighbors 13 year old kid to go fishing with you and your 12 year old lots of luck persuading other parents to let the kid come along trying to find the right boat name can be a chore but don t be tempted to resort back to the best boat name listings found on the net everyone uses these names over and over some of the real popular names are used so much there are several of these already moored in the marina of your choosing all claiming to be miss behaving or aquaholic or obsession just to name a few if you find you need help from these name lists to find a boat every bit as good as wet dream or liquid asset or wind dancer then customize a popular name to make it your own for example obsession is one of the very popular boat names why not customize it such as kristy s obsession or even more daring but cool my wet obsession to add a bit of dark humor to the name pick a name that means something to you or to someone you love the number one mistake in picking a boat name is picking a name that might be impressive to others instead pick a name that is the most valuable to you you are paying for the boat so why name it for the amusement of strangers name the boat for your own purpose and select a name that actually provides you the amusement or the enjoyment 3 x research source there are a number of places to research your boat name there are books in the library that cover the subject very well you can also take a popular name and tailor it to your own liking or better yet consider using an interactive boat name tool such as streetglo s free live boat lettering name suggestions database this boat name tool is unique because it s tied to a network of sources for new boat names one of which comes from a pool new boat owners designing their own boat names it also compiles new boat names by monitoring the boat name searches on google and other search engines it also captures names from boat lettering order entries thus insuring someone liked these new names enough to invest in boat lettering have a look yourself and see new boat lettering names along with a suggested font and color plan that supports the personality these new boat lettering names another great tool to help you name your boat is the noaa fisheries vessel documentation search noaa s national marine fisheries service is a federal agency a division of the department of commerce responsible for the stewardship of the nation s living marine resources and their habitat as per the official identity per the noaa website but for your purpose you can find out just how often your choice in boat name is used by doing a simple boat name search in noaa s vessel documentation if you think you ve come with an awesome new name you can check it at noaa s site likewise you might be surprised to find out the name you picked has already been used 10 000 times and this doesn t even include the millions of small watercraft not linked to the noaa s database investing a little time in your boat name can provide greater enjoyment of your watercraft by helping establish and preserve the mood that motivated you to buy the boat in the first place there are few things about your boat which will continue to provide satisfaction comfort and rest to you over and over without ever costing you again and again i can only think of two things that fit this category the porta potty and the boat name no doubt they both will be the constant source of stress relief and substantial contributors to your overall sense of comfort and release,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

will need to be met try doing some research into your state s requirements to learn more about what you need to do to obtain your license 1 x research source you can try looking at the dmv s website http www dmv org boat registration php some states have exceptions for vessels without motors you may not need to have a license or register something like a canoe or kayak 2 x research source other states may not require any licenses at all 3 x research source choose on line or in person classes many states will offer both on line and in person classes both types of classes will allow you to obtain your boating license in the same way picking the right learning environment for your needs can help you successfully get your boating license online courses provide lectures and tests in the same way in class lectures do 4 x research source you can check for online classes at http www boaterexam com your state will have their own website for in person classes 5 x research source be ready to pay the fees in order to enroll in a boating license course you will need to pay the course fee the exact fee will vary between states you will need to do some research into what the fee is for your own state or on line course to learn more for example new york state generally charges around 10 00 per course 6 x research source some online courses are 29 95 7 x research source some online courses only charge you when you pass the exam 8 x research source learn boat safety parts of the boating exam will test how much you know about boating safety these topics will allow you to demonstrate that you can keep your boat in working order make sure you are prepared for emergencies and ensure that you can operate your boat correctly expect some of these questions to appear on the test 9 x research source where should you place a fire extinguisher on your boat what should you do in case of a fire which boats are most likely to capsize learn the best boating practices there are many rules and practices that you and other boaters should be aware of these rules will help make sure everyone is kept safe while boating preventing any needless accidents from occurring you can expect to find questions like these on the exam 10 x research source 11 x research source what should a power boat approaching a sail boat in darkness do which direction does bad weather usually approach from what side of your boat should you pass red markers on what area is indicated by red and green buoys which side of the boat is the port side learn personal safety although boating is a lot of fun it can also present some dangers it s important that you know how to keep you and your friends safe while out on the water you will likely see some questions that are similar to these on the test 12 x research source what are the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning what are the symptoms of hypothermia how can you help someone recover from hypothermia what is the h e l p position practice the test before you take your boating license test it can be a good idea to get in some practice there are a few options on line that you can use to get a better understanding of what s on the test take some time to look over the practice exams to increase your chances of passing the exam 13 x research source you can find a practice exam here http www boaterexam com canada practice quiz aspx study all material when you sign up to take a boating license exam you will likely be given material to study this material is designed to educate you on the safe operation of boating vessels make sure you fully review all information delivered to you as part of your course to allow you to successfully pass the exam take the exam at the end of the course you will be given the final boating license examination this test will gauge how well you have retained all information presented throughout the course passing the test will demonstrate that you are capable of safely operating a boating vessel and will grant you your boating license 14 x research source the exam will ask you questions that assess how much you know about boats and boating for example you may be asked which side is the port side of a boat you may also be asked questions regarding the proper treatment of hypothermia you should know what to do while boating in stormy weather obtain your license after you successfully pass your boating license exam and have paid any applicable fees you will be allowed to obtain your license this license will ensure that you are obeying the law staying safe and observing proper boating practices your license will likely be a small card similar to a driver s license 15 x research source you need to carry your license or boating education card with you while boating 16 x

how to adjust a trim tab on an outboard motor,in boating trim is the general term for the angle of the boat as it sits in the water when you accelerate if the front of the boat called the bow is too high you won t be able to control the boat in the water if the bow is too low your gas mileage suffers and you won t be able to accelerate very well this is where trim tabs come in trim tabs are optional fins that rest on the back of boats with outboard motors to adjust the angle of the bow while you accelerate keep in mind if you do not have power trim tabs you can still manipulate the angle of the bow the same way by adjusting the motor and stabilizing trim,locate the power trim tab controls near the front of your boat on a boat with power trim tabs all of the trim tab controls are found in one place look for a small digital screen or set of 4 buttons with the word bow printed on or next to them this panel is always located on the helm s dashboard but the exact location is different on every boat consult your instruction manual if you can t spot them right away 1 x research source on some boats there are 2 levers that go up or down instead of 4 buttons power trim tabs are often found on newer and higher end boats but you can have them installed on any boat take your boat out on the water and accelerate to see how it handles undock the boat and take it out on the water accelerate turn right and turn left pay attention to how the boat is handling to determine if it s plane or not if the ride is smooth when you accelerate and turning is balanced you don t need to adjust the trim tabs if the boat feels like it s tilted or listed pay attention to the angle to make adjustments to the trim tabs 2 x research source a boat is plane when the bow front of the boat rests at an angle where it glides over the water unless you re dealing with extremely choppy or calm waters the main goal with the trim tabs is to make the boat plane trim tabs don t do anything when you re in idle or resting in the water you need to get up to speed to see how the boat handles before making trim tab adjustments once you understand the trim tab controls you can adjust them every time you hit the water to customize the way your boat handles based on the conditions adjust the bow down if the helm feels like it s tilted too high if the front of your boat tilts up when you accelerate straight keep the boat at a consistent speed and press both bow buttons down at the same time continue pressing them down until the front of the boat tilts forward and you reach plane you know you re plane when the boat feels like it s gliding over the water 3 x research source press and release both buttons for the same period of time you can cause problems for the angle of the boat if you only press one of the buttons while your boat is level pressing the bow down will cause the trim tabs to raise up and pull water up behind the back of the boat this causes the boat to pitch forward if the bow tilts too far up you can t see in front of you it will also make it harder to handle the boat when the water is choppy or it s windy out since a higher percentage of the hull will be sticking out of the water move the bow up if you re tilted forward or you want to increase speed if the boat bounces a little when you accelerate or it feels like the bow is digging down into the water press both bow buttons up at the same time continue shifting the boat up until you reach plane and release the buttons at the same time 4 x research source this lowers the trim tabs and decreases drag a little this will cause the back of the boat to push forward and raise the angle as you accelerate if the boat tilts too far forward it will bounce up and down as the front of the hull keeps punching through the water if the bow tilts too far down a larger percentage of the hull touches the water this will harm your gas mileage and make it hard to turn the boat when you re accelerating adjust the starboard or port sides separately if the boat is listing if you aren t plane or you have visitors on your boat shifting the weight your boat may list to the port left or starboard right side if this is the case move one side of the bow up or down depending on which side is listing keep moving the left or right side buttons up or down until you make the boat level and you feel like you re standing perpendicular to the water 5 x research source if you re by yourself and the boat feels level only press the buttons at the same time messing with the vertical angle of the boat triggers handling issues if the weight is already even find the buttons on your control grip to adjust the motor trim vertically in the driver s seat look on the side of your control grip handle for 2 buttons that point up and down these adjust the trim of the motor and move it up or down with this style of trim you can manipulate the angle of the boat by moving the motor 6 x research source the motor trim isn t technically a trim tab however your manual may refer to it as a trim tab since it performs the same basic function trim the motor up to lower the angle of the bow and improve control press the higher button on the control grip to move the motor up and shift the boat forward this will push the boat down into the water and make it easier to see and control your boat although you ll give up some speed and gas mileage 7 x research source this can be kind of confusing since the up button moves you down and the down button moves you up you ll get used to this over time this is generally a good move if the water is choppy or you re struggling to control the boat when you turn by pushing the bow forward you stabilize the boat against the surface of the water this makes it much easier to steer and you ll decrease any rocking you re experiencing from choppy waves shift the motor down to raise the angle of the boat and reduce drag press on the lower button on the side of the control grip to lower the motor this will raise your bow by shifting the angle of your motor forward and pushing the boat up from the water this is a great option if you re moving at a consistent pace on calmer water and want to improve your gas mileage and speed 8 x research source when you move the bow forward you reduce the percentage of the hull that is dragging in the water this increases your speed but you give up a little bit of control by doing this rotate the dial on the helm to adjust a stabilizing trim tab if you have a small rotating dial on the dashboard near the helm this is your stabilizing trim tab and it controls the list of the boat this is extremely simple turn the dial to the right to shift the boat to the starboard side and turn the dial to the left to shift the boat to port size you only need to toy with this dial if you have an uneven weight distribution and you re struggling to get plane 9 x research source a boat is plane when it feels like you re gliding over the water this only happens when the bottom of the boat rests evenly against the water at a slight upward angle if the boat is listing you can t get plane if there is a screw on top of this tab turn it 1 2 times with a screwdriver to unlock the tab retighten the screw once you get the boat level like the motor trim this is technically not a trim tab but it performs the same basic function some boats have power trim controls for the tabs on the side and one of these dials for the trims on the motor if your boat has both never use the dial to adjust the list of the boat only use the power trim tabs since they re easier to adjust on the fly,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to buoy an anchor,an anchor buoy is the common term for a trip line 1 x research source anchors can be expensive but you can save yourself this cost with a homemade trip line if you already have one they re relatively easy to deploy and retrieve be sure to use your trip line safely to prevent unnecessary tangles or damage,determine the length of your trip line use a nautical chart a depth finder or another suitable instrument to find the water s depth at high tide the length of your trip line needs to be at least equal to this depth you never know when you ll get tall waves because of rough conditions account for this by adding about 3 ft 91 m to your minimum length for the line 2 x research source avoid allowing too much extra line in the water as this can make it more likely to foul extra slack can be wrapped around the buoy s bottom if you ll only be anchored for a short time use a 1 3 or 1 4 ratio for your line for instance if the depth where you are is 10 ft 3 0 m you d need to pay out 30 40 ft 9 1 12 2 m of chain 3 x expert source nitzan levy sailing instructor expert interview 24 april 2020 if you ll be staying longer use a 1 7 ratio for example if you ll be at the same spot with the 10 ft 3 0 m depth but you ll be staying overnight you d need 70 ft 21 m of chain 4 x expert source nitzan levy sailing instructor expert interview 24 april 2020 fasten the trip line to the anchor the cord of your trip line needs to be firmly attached to the crown of the anchor most anchors will have at least a hole in the fluke or a designated tie on spot for trip lines if the hole on your anchor for your trip line is rough you ll need a shackle so the line doesn t chafe and break 5 x research source if your buoy is not already attached use a firm knot like a large eye splice to fasten it to the anchor opposite end of the rope spool out the trip line to prevent snags and tangles gather the cord of the trip line in a coil so it s easier to manage if necessary pass the coil under and over the pulpit or rail to prevent it from snagging there separate the coil in half and set down the half farther away from the float 6 x research source deploy the trip line approach your anchorage point carefully while keeping ahold of the half of the coil closest to the float toss the float overboard to the anchorage point release the line as you do so it completely streams into the water 7 x research source follow the trip line with the anchor take care during this process to avoid getting the trip line and anchor tangled lower the anchor as you would normally 8 x research source make sure to deploy the trip line before dropping anchor as this will decrease the chances of tangling 9 x research source retrieve the trip line and anchor approach the anchor point with your boat snag and retrieve the buoy of your trip line with a boat hook retrieve the anchor as per usual you ll only need to use the trip line if the anchor is stuck 10 x research source if your anchor doesn t budge it s time to put your trip line to work in many cases simply pulling up on the trip line will capsize the anchor and free it 11 x research source most anchors resist a single direction of travel by adding slack to the anchor line or by pulling in the direction opposite anchor s resisted direction you may pop stuck anchors free 12 x research source maintain and stow your trip line once the anchor s on board it s time to remove the trip line from the crown after using your trip line you should rinse it well in clean water allow the wet line to air dry completely then return it where it belongs in the anchor locker 13 x research source purchase or make a buoy even a cheap styrofoam buoy from your local hardware store should work for a trip line anchor buoy serious boaters or those who frequent deep waters might benefit from sturdier buoys purchased from boat supply stores make an upcycled buoy from a clean plastic jug you can even paint the jug a bright color to make it easier to spot in the water 14 x research source cut polypropylene cord for the buoy not only will polypropylene line withstand harsh conditions better than most other kinds of cordage it also floats the length of your trip line should be about 3 ft 91 m longer than the highest tide in your sailing area choose a bright color of polypropylene cord so you can spot your trip line better in unfavorable conditions 15 x research source after cutting the rope prevent it from fraying at the cut end with glue or by passing a the flame of a lighter over the cut end to melt it attach the buoy to the line with a large eye splice large is the key word here a large eye splice will make snagging your buoy a cinch with a boat hook if you decide to use another kind of knot make sure it s sturdy your trip line won t do you much good if the buoy floats away 16 x research source write a label on your buoy especially in crowded conditions boaters desperate for moorage might take liberties with unmarked buoys send a clear message that your buoy is currently in use by writing trip line don t pick up in large letters along with your boat s name avoid using trip lines overnight in the dark even the most colorful trip lines can be missed this can tangle in a fellow boaters propellers causing trouble for you both especially if there s night traffic on the water you may want to forego a trip line for overnight anchorages 17 x research source prevent boats from damaging your anchor with a trip line crowded harbors can be difficult places to maneuver this can sometimes cause other boats to pass uncomfortably close to your anchor and its line improve visibility of your anchorage point for other boats with a trip line 18 x research source use a trip line when anchoring in areas with a poor bottom broken rock or large pieces of coral can trap your anchor stubbornly in cracks and crevices if you ve had your anchor stuck before in the area you re now anchoring or if you re worried it might get stuck deploy a trip line 19 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to keep pest birds off your boat,if you enjoy boating you re probably well aware that birds such as seagulls cormorants and even pigeons love using masts spreaders and canvases as waterfront perches it s a situation that happens all too often a boat owner plans to take the vessel out for a day of enjoyment only to find it covered in bird droppings some boat owners are finding themselves spending a significant amount of time cleaning up before launch,place deterrent items that move or sway in the wind on the high points of the boat to keep your boat bird free birds prefer the high points on a vessel but will also land on a protective canvas birds rely heavily on visual clues in their environment helping with flight the detection of predators food sources etc and moving flapping objects will discourage birds from flying near or landing items called the bird spider spikes scare balloon flash tape or a solar bird repeller simply placing a decoy of a bird of prey such as an owl on your vessel has been known to be an effective deterrent in keeping other birds away if your vessel has a windex style wind direction indicator at the top of the mast be sure to use the bird spike piece of hardware included to prevent birds perching on and breaking your windex 1 x research source place visual clues such as reflective items around the boat 2 x research source string a monofilament fishing line or cable above the masts and spreaders to deter birds from landing the birds do not like the instability of landing on the wire and so they move on to a more inviting perch 3 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to operate a freshwater fishing boat,fishing from a boat provides the opportunity to fish in deeper waters and to reach areas of the lake impossible to reach when fishing from shore operating a fishing boat however requires knowing the characteristics of your boat and motor so that you can successfully navigate to a fishing spot and knowing how to anchor your boat so it stays in position while casting to that fishing spot the following steps cover these aspects of operating a fishing boat,know the parts of your boat although knowing the terminology is only a small part of boating knowing and understanding the terms for the parts of your boat shows you as a thoughtful boater concerned with the operation of his or her watercraft the hull is the outer skin of your boat most fishing boats have 1 of 3 types of hulls a v hull where the boat tapers to a single point at the front a tri hull where the front comes to 3 points with curves between the points and a flat bottomed hull where the front and back are both squared off jon boats are the most common flat bottomed hull boat while bass boats are often tri hull boats but may also be flat bottom or v hull boats smallurl

steer your boat how you steer your boat depends on how you power it and how powerful the propulsion unit is if fishing from a rowboat you propel yourself forward by stroking both oars equally and turn by stroking the oar on the side opposite the direction you want to turn harder to turn the bow left stroke the starboard oar harder to turn the bow right stroke the port oar harder steering a boat powered by an outboard motor depends on how powerful the motor is motors of 20 horsepower or less are usually steered with a tiller collapsible handle attached to the motor to steer the boat point the tiller in the opposite direction from that which you want to point the bow to steer to port point the tiller to the right which turns the propeller to port to steer to starboard point the tiller to the left which turns the propeller to starboard larger motors are usually steered from a cockpit with a steering wheel similar to that on a car turn the wheel in the direction in which you want to point the bow fishing boats with inboard outboard motors are also steered with a steering wheel unit some outboard motor equipped boats are steered with a control stick placed near the front or middle seat allowing the operator greater forward visibility moving the stick forward steers the boat in one direction and pulling it back steers it in the other stick steering is typically found in boats powered by outboard motors of 50 horsepower or less some manufacturers rate their controls for use up to 70 horsepower fishing boats equipped with stern mounted electric trolling motors are usually steered by tiller although some units feature dual propeller units that mount on the propulsion unit of a larger outboard or inboard outboard motor some boats notably bass boats are equipped with bow mounted trolling motors steered with a foot control pedal some control pedals steer by pushing either the top or the bottom of the pedal to steer the boat in a given direction while others steer by pushing the left side of the pedal to turn the bow to port and the right side to turn to starboard know how to use your motor s gearshift and throttle the presence and position of the gearshift and throttle depend on the size of the motor the smallest motors have no gearshift most however have a gearshift with forward neutral and reverse positions often oriented so that you pull the gearshift lever forward to go forward and push it back to go in reverse the throttle control is a sliding lever mounted on the front of the motor sliding the lever to the right makes the motor go faster larger outboard motors and inboard outboard motors use lever controls mounted on the gunwale adjacent to the cockpit to control whether the motor runs in forward neutral or reverse and how fast it runs electric trolling motors may either have set speeds or variable speed controls all but the smallest tiller controlled units have forward and reverse while bow mounted motors often rely on turning the motor opposite the boat to move it in reverse be aware that putting a motor in neutral or stopping an electric motor will not stop the boat it will instead continue drifting forward at gradually decreasing speed you can shorten the drift by briefly running the motor in reverse carry all appropriate safety equipment in good working condition important equipment to have aboard includes the following life jackets personal flotation devices most jurisdictions require a life jacket or pfd be available for each person aboard the boat and children below a certain threshold age should be wearing theirs it s a good idea to wear yours at all time regardless of your age kill switch this device connects to your motor and your belt if you re thrown from the boat it kills the engine so the boat won t continue on the water under power this can save the lives of other boaters and yours as well as boats have been known to turn on their owners fire extinguisher keep this near enough to the motor to put it out if it catches fire rope in addition to anchor line described under anchoring your boat you should have rope for tying your boat to the dock and to serve as tow rope either if you get stranded or to assist a fellow boater signaling devices these include an air horn or whistle distress flag and flares weather radio having a radio on board to alert you to weather changes can be helpful particularly if you re more focused on catching fish than watching the skies cell phone although thought of more for less important communication you can use a cell phone to call for help in an emergency know where you are on the water and where you re going learn to find landmarks on shore to identify your position on the water and observe the positions of other boats on the water relative to you to avoid colliding with one of them or running aground maintain a safe speed at all times although some boats are capable of riding on plane do so only on open calm water when no other boats are in the vicinity of the wake you ll create by going that fast in rough water conditions go only as fast as necessary to get off the water without getting into a more dangerous predicament never go so fast as to cause your hull to porpoise and slap the water this is called cavitation and it is often a prelude to losing control of your boat particularly during a turn watch the weather storms can come up suddenly on the water so pay attention to sudden changes in temperature cloudiness or wind direction it s a good idea to have foul weather gear aboard in case you can t get off the water before a storm hits such as a waterproof rain parka with elastic cuffs follow all rules and regulations for operating your boat the jurisdiction state province or territory in which you live and operate your fishing boat has established rules and regulations for the operation of boats on its waters knowing and following these regulations is sound practice for running your fishing boat most jurisdictions require fishing boats over a certain length to be registered and display a license number and stickers identifying the jurisdiction in which the boat is registered jurisdictions that require boats to be steam cleaned before operating on waters used as sources of drinking water also require those boats to bear a sticker identifying the boat as having been steam cleaned some jurisdictions prohibit the use of outboard motors in certain waters or restrict boats to no wake operation at slow speeds to prevent shoreline erosion major rivers and large lakes may employ navigational buoys or beacons to identify which waters are deep enough for safe boat operation keep your boat correctly positioned with respect to these markers choose the right kind of anchor anchors are available in several types those commonly used for fishing boats include the following plow style this anchor is so named because it resembles a farming plow and gets its holding power from plowing into sediment on the lake or river bottom danforth this anchor has 2 thick pointed flukes that dig into the bottom to give it its holding power because of its design the danforth is also known as a fluke anchor mushroom this anchor features a round heavy bottom with a continuous lip and is so named because it resembles a large mushroom its holding power comes primarily from how its weight is distributed it is best suited for smaller boats and not suited for anchoring in choppy water attach a length of galvanized chain to the anchor use a length of 3 to 6 feet 0 9 to 1 8 m the chain will stand up to wear and tear caused by rock sand mud or brush better than a fiber line connect the chain to a sufficient amount of nylon anchor line this line will stretch and contract as waves lift and lower the boat while it s anchored absorbing the shock you ll need to purchase enough line so that you can pay out 5 to 7 times the depth of the water you re fishing in plus the distance from the anchor cleat to the water s surface if you re fishing in 18 feet 5 4 m of water and the anchor cleat is 2 feet 0 6 m above the surface you ll need to pay out from 100 to 140 feet 30 to 42 m of anchor line to cover the 20 feet 6 m from the cleat to the lake or river bottom the best way to store the anchor line until needed is on a windlass near where you normally sit when fishing or operating the boat with guides to keep the line between the bow cleat and windlass next to the gunwale some windlasses feature a hand crank with a quick release feature for lowering the anchor look for as sheltered a place to anchor as you can find the ideal place should be away from other boats out of the wind and away from current determine the depth to and type of bottom a depth sounder can help you find how deep the water is and also help determine whether the bottom is sandy muddy or rocky coupled with your observation of the nearest shoreline point the bow of your boat into the wind or current shift your motor into neutral when you reach the place you want to drop anchor drop anchor slowly once the boat stops moving forward set the engine to idle reverse and back down on the anchor to ensure it

how to solo drive a 100 foot power yacht,have you wondered how to solo drive a 100 foot 30 5 m power yacht if you don t know then this guide will get you started in driving your new power engine driven yacht away from the dock around the harbor and returning it to the dock safely,understand the basics about yachts before you actually attempt to drive the yacht sit in the cabin a few days and practice operating the marine radio and other communications and safety equipment learn the proper radio frequencies for emergencies the international distress frequency is 156 80mhz coast guard and harbor patrol 157 10mhz ship to ship calling frequency 156 45mhz ship to shore 156 70mhz marine operator to make a phone call 157 20mhz these are just a few channels check your area for the preferred channels in use your vhf radio has a range of more than 30 miles 48 km and a cell phone won t help much at sea apply to the fcc federal communications commission for your operator s license so you can operate the radios legally if you have more interest in ship radio try this the website for the commercial radio operator license program read about who needs what kind of license and find information on obtaining the licenses anyone who operates a boat needs to receive their boating safety i d card and certificate this can be done by taking a class from the u s coastguard s list of safety courses and passing the final exam learn the yacht steering controls most will have a steering wheel and two throttles these controls are required for sufficient steering of the boat the steering wheel will not do a good job of steering at slow speeds in a tight harbor the engines do most of the steering at slow speeds the engines alone can steer your boat for example to make a right turn around in a tight area advance the left throttle slowly while retarding the right throttle the same amount this is called differential steering if you do this properly you will make the turn without ever moving the boat forward or backward of course you will have to practice this for a long time to perfect it in a car you can idle the engine and hold the brake to stop in a boat you are always at the mercy of the wind and tide the only way to hold your position is with differential steering with the engines at all times don t say left or right in a boat the terms for the four directions are port starboard forward and aft leave the dock think about your limits and don t try to drive away in a yacht without the required crew members depending on the size of the yacht it may require no crew members or several crew members a 100 foot 30 5 m yacht can be driven alone with the help of a dock hand to untie the yacht from the dock and also help when you return to the dock learn about cruising when you think you can control the boat try cruising in a straight line use partial throttle equally on both engines to cruise forward in a straight line use the steering wheel while cruising for directional control if something gets in your way just reduce the throttles to slow down if you need to stop quicker reverse both engines equally just enough to stop forward motion this is where you may need to go to differential engines to hold position return to the dock docking is the most difficult to master and the most dangerous a lot of damage will result if you do this wrong try to practice docking in a calm wind first if you re docking on the port side try using the starboard engine forward and aft and repeat this maneuver the boat should ease to port side slowly this is where you really need a dock crew especially in a little wind some yachts have side thrusters to help move the boat sideways this will make docking a lot smoother,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to drive a bass boat,some anglers will tell you that if you re fishing for bass from any boat even a kayak then it s a bass boat however when fishing enthusiasts hear the term bass boat they often think of a fast boat that can quickly move from spot to spot but quietly linger when the bass are biting because modern bass boats can move so fast through the water safety is a major consideration as a driver or passenger you also need to work on stealthily maneuvering your boat into position to hook that trophy bass,launch your bass boat carefully if you re launching your boat from a vehicle trailer make a plan beforehand and bring a friend or two to help slowly back the trailer into the water then put your vehicle in park and apply the parking brake start the boat s motor once it s in the water undo the winch hook on the trailer and slowly back off and away from the trailer keep an eye on your surroundings at all times when you re docked on the water push away several feet meters from the dock before applying the throttle and watch out for other boats or obstacles in all directions put on life jackets and the kill switch everyone on the boat needs to wear an approved life jacket that fits properly at all times it doesn t matter if you re a good swimmer falling off of a fast moving bass boat can knock you into the water unconscious 1 x research source the kill switch clips onto the driver and attaches to the boat with a cord if the cord detaches from the boat if the pilot falls into the water for instance the engine will immediately cut off don t exceed the boat s passenger limit like all boats bass boats have a maximum passenger limit this should be clearly marked on your boat however you can also use this old trick if you can t find the posted limit 2 x research source multiply the length and width of the boat in feet 1 ft 0 3 m divide this number by 15 and round down to get your maximum passenger number so the maximum passenger limit for an 18 feet 5 5 m by 4 5 feet 1 4 m boat would be 5 people 18 x 4 5 81 81 15 5 4 round down to 5 master driving your boat before taking passengers or hitting busy waters if the boat is new to you take the necessary time learning to operate it in calm safe conditions if you re new to boating take a boating class whether it s required by law or not and spend time on the water with experienced boaters so you can learn from them if you have a smaller bass boat with a motor of under 20 horsepower you ll probably utilize the motor itself for steering via the tiller handle shifting pulling the lever toward you to go forward pushing it away for reverse with neutral in the middle and throttle control sliding the lever right to go faster larger bass boats often have a steering wheel similar to that of a car with throttle and shift controls on the adjacent panel or nearby gunwale side wall control your speed especially as a novice some modern bass boats can go 70 miles per hour 110 km h or more but that doesn t mean you should max out the motor the first time you get it in the water going too fast reduces your reaction time and can also cause the bow front of the boat to lift obstructing your view and possibly causing the boat to flip 3 x research source make sure you know what different buoys channel markers no wake zones and other signs mean and obey them take a class if you re new to boating or consider a refresher course if you ve been on the water for a while practice adjusting the trim on your motor before trying higher speeds basically trim refers to the angle of the propeller in the water similarly tilt refers to raising the propeller shaft near or to horizontal trimming down when accelerating forward helps keep the bow from lifting and can push the bow down enough to slow the boat trimming up can help you achieve a level boating plane if the bow is too low 4 x research source you might need to adjust trim manually on smaller boats but larger bass boats usually use electronically actuated hydraulics controlled at the helm treat all nearby boaters as poor drivers often you ll have no idea whether another boat within view is being piloted by a seasoned pro or someone who doesn t know what they re doing it s always safest to keep as much distance as you can from other boats and keeping clear of other boats also makes it easier to catch bass 5 x research source go slow and steady in rough water if it s a windy day and the water is choppy it s best to stay on dry land if you do find yourself in rough water though try to steer into the wind instead of with it or especially across it keep the bow of the boat a bit elevated by adjusting the trim up so you can ride straight over the oncoming waves or if necessary zig zag back and forth so you can ride the trough between the waves and then mount them at a 45 degree angle 6 x research source approach waves straight on or at an angle whenever possible letting waves crash against and over a bass boat s low gunwales side walls is a good way to swamp or even sink your boat 7 x research source identify your prime fishing spots there are healthy doses of trial and error and luck involved in catching bass but some thoughtful planning will improve your chances scout out likely spots for finding bass based on the time of year and the body of water 8 x research source in rivers streams and tidewaters bass usually set up in current breaks or other spots where they can face the current and let their prey come to them in ponds and especially lakes bass relocate seasonally in shallow protected areas in spring to spawn and fall to feed for winter and in deeper open areas in winter and summer use a trolling motor to move steadily but quietly in addition to the primary outboard motor on the stern back side many bass boats also have a trolling motor on the bow side an electric trolling motor enables you to stealthily position yourself and remain in slow but constant motion and both of these qualities are helpful in catching bass 9 x research source use a drift net instead of an anchor dropping your anchor can startle the skittish bass you re hoping to catch so unless the conditions are rough enough that you need the anchor use a drift net to help keep your boat properly oriented 10 x research source drift nets are also called drift socks or drift anchors they look like funnels made out of fabric and create drag in the water to help maintain your position without completely stopping you 11 x research source position your boat so you can make longer casts even if you re humming along quietly with your trolling motor putting your boat right over top of your prime fishing spot may scare away the bass you re seeking instead when possible rely on longer casts so you can keep your boat close but not too close 12 x research source however you may need to move directly over top of your fishing spot for instance if the bass are hiding out under a submerged fallen tree use the fishing conditions and your own bass fishing experience as your guide don t race to the next fishing spot even if you re taking part in a bass fishing competition roaring at full speed from one prime spot to the next is not a good idea the risk of injuring yourself or others is simply too high always keep your boat under control if someone gets to your secret spot before you accept it and move on to your next location 13 x research source look for a boat that can operate in shallow water great bass fishing spots are often found in shallow water that is canopied by trees or other features so it pays to have a boat that doesn t protrude deep into the water boats marketed specifically as bass boats usually either have flat bottoms or a wide v shape 14 x research source choose a boat that provides ample fishing space being able to fish from multiple positions and angles will improve your chances of catching bass many bass boats have fishing platforms on the bow and stern and one or more swivel chairs so you can cast in all directions while seated 15 x research source look for a boat that s large enough to give you ample fishing space but small enough to fit into sheltered areas near the shore bass boats are often 16 to 25 feet 4 9 to 7 6 m 5 8 m long pair up an outboard and a trolling motor the primary outboard motor on the stern will determine how fast your bass boat can go a trolling motor placed on the bow however lets you slowly creep into position while stalking bass if you re a serious bass angler you ll want to have both motors on your boat 16 x research source consider the many extras available modern bass boats can be fully loaded with high tech equipment and ample storage and comfort amenities a good built in live well for storing your catch in is a good feature to prioritize otherwise consider your fishing preferences and budget when choosing extras 17 x research source depending on the type of boat and its extras a fiberglass or aluminum bass boat can cost from 10 000 to over 50 000 usd 18 x research source alternatively basic flat bottomed boats and kayaks or canoes can often be had for a few hundred dollars or up to 5 000 usd for high end models and always remember if you catch bass from a boat any boat it s a bass boat and you re a bass catcher,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

them to use the lock first make sure the gates and paddles at the far end of the lock are closed then open the paddles at the near end the end nearest your moored boat you open a paddle by fitting the lock key onto the winding mechanism and turning it many times the lock crew opens the gates while the boat is entering close the paddles guide your vessel into the lock the skipper should enter the lock if appropriate throw a rope to your shore crew for instance a narrow boat ascending a wide lock can experience a lot of turbulence and you may wish to ask for your front or centre rope to be tied to a bollard to give you something to drive against to keep position more easily otherwise the shore crew will be able to control the boat without tying up by holding the ropes and using bollards to safely reduce the strain and resist snatching in fact if you are descending you must not let anyone tie up your craft when descending a narrow lock there will be little turbulence and ropes are rarely needed the skipper can usually control the boat adequately with the engine on low revs on the river thames engines must be turned off in locks close the gate behind the boat and check the paddles are shut open the paddles at the other end of the lock open just one paddle very slowly at first and observe the consequences be ready to close paddles quickly if things start to go wrong do not re secure any locks on the paddles until the boat is safely ready to leave when ascending open ground paddles first do not open gate paddles until the lock is half full and there is no danger of a fountain of

exit close the gates unless a boat is approaching the lock from ahead you can save them and you time by leaving the gates open for them if the other boat is lightly crewed you might even wait to close the gates after the other boat has entered if a boat is coming from behind you may wish to save them some time by opening a paddle at their end of the lock rejoin your boat,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to choose a propeller for a boat,a new propeller can help you tweak the performance of your boat to suit your preferences the two main measurements of a boat propeller are diameter and pitch you can increase or decrease both the diameter and the pitch of your boat s prop to change how it performs the type of material it s made out of and the number of blades your propeller has are also things to consider when you re shopping for a new propeller remember that you can always consult the staff at a marine dealership to help you choose the right prop for your boat they ll usually even let you test out a few different props before you commit to buying,increase propeller diameter for more control and power propellers with a larger diameter give your boat more control and power but create more drag and decrease your acceleration choose a propeller with a greater diameter if you have a large boat that requires a lot of control and power 1 x research source for example if you have a big fishing boat and you haul a lot of gear regularly your boat could benefit from a propeller with a bigger diameter so it has more power to carry all the weight the diameter is the distance from the center of the prop to the tip of one of the blades multiplied by 2 drag is how much your boat acts like something is dragging it down which makes it go slower a prop that has too big of a diameter and water conditions are the 2 main things that can create drag decrease propeller diameter for more acceleration propellers with smaller diameters rotate faster thus creating more acceleration choose a propeller with a lesser diameter if you have a small boat that you want to get up to fast speeds 3 x research source for example sports cruisers can benefit from propellers with smaller diameters raise the pitch for higher top speeds pick a propeller with a higher pitch to increase the top speed of your boat keep in mind that a higher pitch will also decrease your boat s acceleration 4 x research source the pitch is the distance the propeller will theoretically move your boat with 1 full revolution of the shaft for example a 21 pitch prop will theoretically move your boat 21 in 53 cm with 1 complete rotation of the propeller pitch is theoretical because you have to be operating your boat in optimal conditions for the pitch to be 100 accurate for example water conditions wind and a boat s weight and design can cause a prop to slip which lowers the pitch heavy commercial boats usually rely on propellers with higher pitches lower the pitch for better acceleration propellers with lower pitches have higher rpms thus resulting in greater acceleration for your boat opt for a new propeller with a lower pitch if your goal is increasing the acceleration 5 x research source keep in mind that a lower pitch will also decrease the top speed of your boat a rule of thumb is that for every 1 in 2 5 cm less in the pitch the propeller will spin about 200 rpms faster light recreational boats typically use propellers with lower pitches select a stainless steel propeller for offshore boats stainless steel propellers are the highest performing and most durable type of boat prop choose a propeller made out of stainless steel if you have an offshore saltwater boat that you operate in deep waters 6 x research source stainless steel props are designed to provide the best performance but are expensive to repair or replace if you hit something that s why they are best used in deep water choose an aluminum propeller for river boats aluminum propellers are softer so it s possible to repair minor damage in them if you hit something in shallow water for example opt for a propeller made out of aluminum if you have a boat that you operate in rivers or other shallow waters 7 x research source since aluminum is a relatively soft metal if you hit something when you re boating in shallow water the propeller will get damaged instead of causing damage to the shaft or gears then you can either repair the propeller or buy a new one since they are less expensive than stainless steel props opt for a 3 blade prop for the most balanced performance propellers that have 3 blades provide the best all around performance pick a 3 blade propeller if you don t need a higher performance in certain areas so you ll get the best mix of acceleration lift speed and fuel efficiency 8 x research source for example if you just have a speed boat for everyday use a 3 blade prop can be a great choice get a 4 blade prop if you want better acceleration fuel efficiency and lift more blades translate into faster acceleration better fuel efficiency and more lift which is how high the boat hull lifts up out of the water when you re driving it choose a propeller with 4 blades if you want higher performance in these areas but keep in mind that it will often lower performance in other areas such as top speed 9 x research source for example if you have a heavy high performance boat like a large speed boat you might benefit from using a 4 blade propeller choose a 4 blade high diameter low pitch prop for a pontoon boat pontoon boats are not meant to handle high speeds and can benefit from 4 blade propellers because of the added surface area that makes the ride more responsive a bigger diameter and lower pitch will give the boat more control and power 11 x research source other terms you might come across are cup and rake angle cup is the curve on the edges of a prop s blades and rake angle is the degree of the slant on the blades these both affect a propeller s pitch so a low pitch prop will have a low cup and low rake angle either a stainless steel or aluminum prop can work for a pontoon boat depending on how deep the water you plan to operate it in is select a 3 blade low pitch high diameter prop for a deck boat deck boats are another type of boat that is not meant for high speeds so a prop with a low pitch is best because it will create a slower more controlled ride it s ok to go with a 3 blade prop to add a little more acceleration and speed than a 4 blade prop 12 x research source a 3 blade low pitch prop will still also have a low cup and a low rake angle depending on how deep the water you operate your deck boat in is a stainless steel or aluminum prop can both work pick a 3 or 4 blade prop with medium diameter and pitch for a ski boat a 3 or 4 blade propeller with both a moderate diameter and pitch will create a balanced ride for a ski boat this creates a good balance between speed and handling which are both important when you re driving this type of boat 13 x research source these types of propellers can have a moderate cupping and rake angle as well a stainless steel prop is best for a ski boat because they perform better and you will be likely be operating the boat in mostly deeper water opt for a high pitch low diameter stainless steel prop for a speed boat speed boats require the highest performing highest speed propellers a stainless steel prop with a high pitch and a low diameter will provide the most acceleration and speed 14 x research source this type of propeller will have a high cup and a high rake angle as well a 3 blade prop for a speed boat will usually offer the top speed performance for a speed boat another feature to look for in a speed boat propeller is thinner blades the thinner the blades are the less drag they create in the water which helps when you re going for top speed performance,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to clean a boat water tank,having a fresh water system on your boat is super convenient if you tend to go on long boating trips you can use it to cook clean or even take showers while you re out on the water unfortunately boat water tanks can become home to mold bacteria and algae giving the water an unpleasant smell and taste or even making it unsafe to drink keep the water on your boat fresh and clean by cleaning out your tank and disinfecting it with bleach at least once a year 1 x research source,turn on your boat s water pump before you clean your boat s tank you ll need to empty out the stale water inside if your water pump isn t already on turn it on so that you can drain your tank completely 2 x research source the location of the pump and water tank varies from one boat to another if you re not sure where to look consult a schematic of your boat or your owner s manual if you have it open your taps and let the water run out turn on any taps that are connected to your water tank let them run until no more water comes out 3 x research source listen for air coming out of the taps this will tell you that the tank is empty shut off the pump to keep it from burning out after the tank is empty switch off your pump to stop it from cycling this will help prevent the impeller from wearing out 4 x research source many boats have pumps that automatically turn on after the water pressure drops below a certain level this is meant to keep your water moving as the level in the tank gets lower 5 x research source open the cap on the tank locate the access cap on your water tank and twist it off it should be clearly marked as the cap for the water tank rather than the fuel or waste tank this will allow you to access the inside of the tank so that you can inspect and clean it 6 x research source in some cases the cap might be difficult to remove you may need a special tool to open it consult the user manual for your boat or your specific water system 7 x research source use a flashlight to look for dirt in the tank that needs to be cleaned out shine a flashlight through the opening of the tank and look for obvious dirt algae mold scale or sediment on the sides and bottom of the tank if any of this is present you ll need to clean it out before disinfecting and refilling your tank 8 x research source if you re able to get your hand in through the opening of the tank feel the inside walls if they feel slick or slimy that s a sign of bacterial buildup scrub out the tank with a long handled brush or power washer take a long handled scrub brush and a little dishwasher detergent and scrub away any grime on the sides and bottom of the tank alternatively you can hose it down with a power hose attached to a clean source of water make sure you get into the corners and the hard to reach spaces at the top of the tank 9 x research source if you use a power washer you ll need some angle attachments to get into hard to reach corners turn on the pump and drain the tank switch the pump back on and open the taps to drain any dirty water and cleaning solution out of the tank wait until the water drains completely then shut off the taps 10 x research source if you emptied the tank completely the first time it will probably take a few minutes for the water to start flowing again since there will be air in the pipes turn off your pump and hot water heater once the tank is completely empty again you can begin the process of disinfecting it shut off your pump and turn off the hot water heater if your boat has one 11 x research source consult your user manual if you re not sure where the water heater is located remove and clean any filters or faucet aerator screens if there are any filters or carbon canisters attached to your water tank take them off if the filters appear dirty or haven t been changed in a while clean or replace them according to the instructions for your particular filter take the aerator screens out of the faucets and wash those as well 12 x research source to remove your faucet aerators unscrew them with a wrench clean the aerators with hot soapy water and a scrub brush if there are a lot of mineral deposits on the screen you can remove them by soaking the aerator in white vinegar for a few minutes before scrubbing it 13 x research source if your pump has a protective mesh strainer leave that in place it will help protect your pump during the cleaning process if your water tank has a vent hose and screen detach those as well clean them with hot soapy water if they appear dirty measure out enough 5 bleach to make a 50 ppm solution in your tank the cheapest and easiest way to sanitize your boat water tank is with household chlorine bleach use a 5 chlorine bleach product and pour enough into a bucket or other container to make a 50 ppm parts per million solution based on the size of your tank 14 x research source you can use this chlorine calculator to determine the correct amount of bleach to use https www publichealthontario ca en health topics environmental occupational health water quality chlorine dilution calculator for example if you have a 50 us gal 190 l tank you d need to use about 6 7 fluid ounces 200 ml of bleach mix the bleach with 1 gallon 3 8 l of water before you pour the bleach into your tank combine it with clean water this will help distribute the bleach more evenly through your tank 15 x research source combining the bleach with water before you pour it in will also help prevent corrosion if your tank is aluminum pour the bleach and water mixture into the boat tank add your mixture slowly and carefully to the empty tank 16 x research source you may find it helpful to use a funnel alternatively you can fill the tank with fresh water before adding the bleach to the tank 17 x research source top off the tank with clean drinking quality water use a clean source of potable water such as a filtered dockside hose to fill up your tank after you put the bleach inside 18 x research source if possible stir the water around with a clean implement like a long spoon or stirring rod to distribute the bleach 19 x research source if your tank has a vent let a little of the water and bleach solution spill out through the vent in order to sanitize the vent line if the vent is exterior put a bucket or other container under it to keep the bleach solution from entering the water outside your boat switch the pump back on and let the water run until you smell chlorine turn on the pump and open all the taps on your boat starting with those farthest from the pump 20 x research source allow the water to run for a few minutes until you notice a smell of bleach then close the taps leave the pump on 21 x research source it may take a few minutes for the pump to push all the air out of the lines and get the water flowing again let the bleach solution sit in the tank for 12 hours you ll need to leave the bleach in the tank for several hours to do its work and kill any lingering mold algae or bacteria in your water system allow it to sit overnight or for a full day before flushing it out 22 x research source if you don t have time to let the bleach stay in your water tank for a full 12 hours try to leave it for at least 4 hours 23 x research source refill and drain your tank 2 3 times or until you can t smell bleach drain your water tank and refill it again with fresh clean water then empty your tank again do this 2 or 3 times or until you no longer smell a bleach or chlorine odor when the water is running 24 x research source if you still smell a hint of bleach after flushing and refilling the tank twice add 1 teaspoon 4 9 ml of hydrogen peroxide per 20 gallons 76 l of tank capacity and flush the tank again the hydrogen peroxide should neutralize the remaining bleach replace the filters and vent screen once the water is running fresh and clean replace any parts of the water system you removed during the cleaning process this may include the filters or carbon cartridges the vent screen and hose and your faucet aerator screens 25 x research source turn the pump and water heater back on and open the taps to let air out switch everything back on and open all the taps both hot and cold let the taps run until all the air is out of the system and the water flows smoothly 26 x research source start with the tap farthest from the pump and work your way to the closest one make sure to let the air out of each tap to get your system working properly again 27 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to prepare a boat for fishing,fishing from a boat provides certain advantages to fishing from shore notably the ability to reach more fishing places during a fishing outing than the section of the lake or stream adjacent to a single shore however buying a fishing boat also means taking on the responsibilities of owning it one of those responsibilities is preparing your boat for fishing for the first time another is doing so at the start of each fishing season read the following steps for instructions and suggestions on preparing your boat for fishing,license your boat most jurisdictions require boats of at least a certain length to be licensed in order to be used on their waters licensed boats typically display a sticker identifying the licensing jurisdiction followed by a series of letters and numbers in the united states most states have reciprocal arrangements where a boat licensed in one state may be used in the waters of another state by a visiting boater some states stipulate the appearance of the letter and number stickers that may be used such as yellow characters on a black background check the regulations for your jurisdiction if you transport your boat on a trailer your trailer will need to be licensed as well while your boat is usually licensed through a state s game and fish commission or department of natural resources the trailer is typically licensed through the state s department of motor vehicles purchase all necessary safety equipment to operate a fishing boat or any other kind of boat on the water requires having certain pieces of safety equipment on board some of it is required by law other items are just a good idea to have with you a partial list of items to enhance your safety is given below life jackets personal flotation devices most jurisdictions require a life jacket or other pfd for each passenger aboard and for children below a certain age to be wearing theirs it s a good idea to wear your life jacket at all times on the water even if the law doesn t require it which means selecting a comfortable life jacket you will want to wear you ll want a life jacket slightly larger than your jacket size so that you can wear it over a jacket you can adjust it to fit more snugly when not wearing it over a jacket kill switch if your boat has an outboard or inboard outboard motor a kill switch clipped to your belt and to the engine will shut it off if you re thrown from the boat many jurisdictions require a kill switch for boats with motors above a certain horsepower fire extinguisher having a fire extinguisher near the motor will help to quickly put out an engine fire if it occurs check the laws for your jurisdiction as to whether an extinguisher is required and what type rope you ll need rope to tie your boat to the dock as well as for your anchor you should also have a tow rope in case you get stranded in the middle of the lake or to help someone who does signaling devices such things as an air horn whistle flags or flares can alert others to your predicament when in distress or sound a warning in foggy conditions check the laws for your jurisdiction as to what devices are required weather radio this can alert you to upcoming changes in the weather before you note the changes in the sky wind and water choppiness you may also want to buy a cell phone if you don t already have one as you can use it to call for help while out on the water if you plan to fish from your boat at night you ll need to have night time running lights which typically include red and green lights for the bow and a white light for the stern check with your jurisdiction as to the type of lights required for your size of boat get an anchor and supporting equipment you ll need to have an anchor for those times when you want to keep your boat in the same place when fishing and you ll also need equipment to support it the 3 main anchor types used for fishing are the plow style and danforth anchors which feature blades or flukes that dig into the bottom and the mushroom anchor named for its shape which holds primarily due to its weight a good rule of thumb is to have 1 pound 2 2 kg of anchor weight for every foot of boat length you may have multiple anchors with your bow anchor serving as the primary anchor and the heaviest anchor of the group you ll want to have enough nylon anchor rope to have from 5 to 7 times the distance from the anchor cleat to the bottom as this can be a lot of rope a windlass to keep the rope on will keep it from fouling around your feet when not paid out you ll also need a cleat or housing for the anchor to rest on when not in the water instead of tying the anchor line directly to your anchor use a length of galvanized chain of 3 to 6 feet 0 9 to 1 8 m to take the wear and tear caused by dragging the anchor over the bottom before it catches carry items to cope with weather conditions the weather can change suddenly while you re out on the water it helps to be prepared the following items can help polarized sunglasses can protect your eyes from glare on the water and help you see under the surface to avoid submerged stumps brush and rocks sunscreen with a sun protection factor spf of 15 or better in conjunction with wearing long pants and long sleeves will help protect you from sunburn foul weather gear such as a waterproof rain parka will help keep you drier if it rains suddenly while you re out on the lake consider other items to help you organize your gear rod holders and tie downs for other items such as landing nets will keep those items from shifting around as the boat moves keeping you from losing them in a sudden turn or from accidental injury from a rod tip or fish hook renew your boat and trailer licenses these usually have to be renewed each year inspect the boat for signs of wear clean the inside and outside hull of any barnacles or debris and look for dents or cracks in it particularly on the bottom and around rivets also inspect the drain plug to make sure it still seals the drain hole properly and that any onboard lights and electronics work correctly inspect your motor test the engine to make sure it runs and there are no fluid leaks replace any necessary parts and in the case of inboard or larger outboard motors with 4 cycle engines change the oil also clean the propeller of any debris and make sure it turns freely inspect the crank battery for your main motor and the deep cycle battery for your trolling motor for leaks and to make sure they hold a charge inspect the boat trailer make sure the wheels and tires are in good shape along with the winch and pads be sure the trailer taillights work as well inspect and replace any necessary safety equipment check all life jackets for any tears and your children s to see that they still fit check the batteries in your weather radio and that your fire extinguishers are properly filled and in working order consider a professional inspection if you don t have the time to inspect your boat yourself or if you notice something you re not sure is a problem you can have your boat inspected by a mechanic or outdoor retailer equipped to do inspections boats used for saltwater fishing can be inspected by marine surveyors accredited by either the national association of marine surveyors or the society of accredited marine surveyors,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to register a boat,if you re planning to get a motorized boat make sure you follow the law regarding registration just like cars states require boats to be registered registration lets the authorities know who s operating boats legally on a given waterway states vary when it comes to boat registration rules and fees before you go out on the water in your boat check with the appropriate state agency to ensure you re in compliance 1 x research source,get a boat registration application from the appropriate state agency you re required to register your boat in the state where you keep it states vary when it comes to the agencies that handle boat registration common state agencies that handle boat registration include the department of motor vehicles the department of fish and game or the state agency specifically dedicated to managing waterways 2 x research source you can pick up an application from the appropriate state agency in person or download one from the agency s website if you just bought a brand new boat the dealer most likely will give you a boat registration application and tell you where to send it you can also search online to find out which agency in the state where you park your boat handles registration fill out the boat registration application boat registration applications are detailed and ask for information such as your name and address you have to state truthfully that you are the owner of the boat and attach proof of ownership you also must provide details about what the boat is made out of as well as the hull identification number 3 x research source on your boat registration application be prepared to state truthfully that you have paid taxes on your boat gather your proof of ownership documents you re required to show proof of ownership of your boat a boat title in your name is the best proof of ownership but if you don t have one a bill of sale which is basically a sales receipt for your boat works fine if you bought the boat and haven t yet paid off the owner you can provide your sales contract as proof of ownership 4 x research source be prepared to show documentation of any loans you have on your boat as part of the registration process mail in the application copies of supporting documents and fee boat registration fees vary widely among the states but are mostly affordable in most cases you can expect to pay less than 100 for the boat registration sticker and documents combined you can drop off the application in person or send it to the appropriate state government agency by mail 5 x research source send your payment for initial registration by personal check cashier s check or money order avoid sending cash if you drop off your application in person you might be able to pay with your credit card affix your registration number to your boat with paint or decals when the state processes your boat registration you ll get a registration number and a decal to put on your boat with rare exceptions you re required to display your registration number and the decals on both sides of the front half of your boat 6 x research source you can purchase waterproof block letters at your local boating or home improvement store it s a good idea to purchase waterproof paint and block letter and number stencils so that your registration number is in compliance and easy to read from a distance boat registrations usually expire after two years and must be renewed review the boat registration renewal notice that you got in the mail states usually send out registration renewal notices two months in advance of expiration review the notice carefully to find out if there are any required changes you need to make to be in compliance for example occasionally the u s coast guard may require certain registration numbers to be changed should this happen you would be required to remove the old registration number and display the new registration number to avoid a fine 7 x research source create an account and log in to your state s licensing renewal website most states require initial registration by mail or in person and allow registration renewal online the website you re supposed to use is listed on your renewal notice follow the prompts online to complete your registration renewal if you don t have a laptop with you at the time of renewal don t worry most registration renewal websites can be accessed on your smartphone you can also renew your boat registration by mail or in person if you so choose depending on the state pay your boat registration renewal fee online with a credit card states that process registration renewals online usually accept a variety of credit cards you might also be able to pay the renewal fee using a service like paypal depending on the state 8 x research source pay your boat registration renewal fee by check money order or cashier s check if you send in your renewal form by mail your boat registration number may not change but you ll be sent a new decal to put alongside it,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to get compensation from a bui accident,if you were injured in a boating accident then you can sue the boat operator who caused the injury for example the operator may have hit your own boat or you may have been in the boat with the operator who was intoxicated either way you can sue the operator and be compensated for lost wages medical bills and pain and suffering to begin you should document the incident and your injuries and then meet with an attorney,get medical treatment you should seek immediate medical treatment for any injury if you can t drive yourself to a hospital then call emergency services after you are stabilized you can begin planning your case remember to hold onto copies of your medical records these documents help prove the extent of your injuries also follow the proposed medical treatment 1 x research source if you don t then the boat operator could claim that you aggravated your injuries by not following doctor s orders document the damage to your property you can be reimbursed for any damage caused to your property 2 x research source for example you might have been in a boat when the other person rammed you you need to document the damage to your boat take photographs of damage to your property this will help show the extent of the damage get an estimate for repairs if your boat was damaged take it to a shop and ask for a detailed estimate of how much it would cost to fix the boat if you already have had the boat fixed before trial then hold onto the itemized receipt of what work was done identify witnesses at trial you will need to prove that the defendant s conduct caused your injury this generally will mean that you need to show that the boat operator was reckless or careless negligent you should get the names of people who saw the boat operator cause the accident witnesses are often identified in police reports so you should get a copy of the report filed on the incident 3 x research source see obtain a police report for tips on how to get yours photograph the scene of the incident the boat might have hit something in the water like a buoy or a coral reef in that situation take pictures of what you hit you might also take pictures of the water although this can be less helpful if the conditions on the day you take photographs are not the same as the conditions the day of the accident write down your memories you were also a witness to the accident so you should write down your memories as soon as possible the day of if you are able document what the other person did and what you did try to remember important details such as how you were exactly injured be honest in your assessment it is important not to exaggerate which reduces your credibility for example writing the other boat was flying over the water is less credible than writing the boat was going faster than we were document your lost income you can be compensated for any lost work as a result of your injuries 4 x research source if you are permanently disabled then you can be compensated for income you expected to earn in the future you should gather the following documents which will help show how much income you have lost w 2 forms pay stubs tax returns proof of self employed income hold onto all medical bills you can be compensated for any money spent treating your injuries for this reason you should put all medical bills in a big folder so that you don t lose them you can be reimbursed for the following 5 x research source rehabilitation costs doctor and hospital fees prescription medication costs of a therapist take photos of your injuries another way to document your injuries is to take color photographs at least a year or more could pass before your trial starts so it is a good idea to document your physical injuries thoroughly using photographs 6 x research source make sure to take pictures from many different angles also take some pictures close up so that you can see the injury in detail keep a pain journal you can also get compensation for your pain and suffering 7 x research source these injuries can be harder to prove however one thing you can do is keep a pain journal in your journal you write down daily where you feel the pain and its intensity also note how the pain has influenced your life if you have trouble sleeping or if you can t move as well as you used to then note those facts as well if your pain is causing you to miss out on experiences like going out with friends make sure you record that hire an attorney at a minimum you should meet with an attorney to discuss whether you have a strong case you can find a personal injury attorney by looking in the phone book or by searching online if you can t get any leads that way then contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral schedule a consultation and ask how much the attorney charges for your consultation you should also discuss how much it would cost to hire the attorney to handle the entire case although you can certainly represent yourself your chances of getting compensation are much higher if you have an attorney represent you if someone died and you are bringing a wrongful death claim then you certainly need an attorney 8 x research source discuss whether the attorney works on contingency under this agreement the attorney doesn t charge any fees instead they take a percentage of any amount you win at trial or get in a settlement they usually get 33 40 of the amount 9 x research source contingency fee agreements can make an attorney affordable however the attorney may not represent you unless you have significant physical injuries estimate how much your injury is worth you should gather all of your medical bills and proof of lost income add them together then multiply this amount by a number between one and five for any pain and suffering you have experienced one if you have experienced little or no pain five for an extreme amount the more extreme the pain and suffering the more compensation you can get 10 x research source you also might be able to get punitive damages because the boat operator was drunk this amount of money is awarded to punish the defendant punitive damages are available in many states for dui cases so they may be available in bui cases as well 11 x research source identify who to negotiate with often the person who operated the boat also owns the boat however you might have been injured by a boat operator who does not own the boat depending on your state law the boat owner may be responsible for your injuries not the boat operator 12 x research source ask the boat owner and operator if different people for their insurance information 13 x research source if the person does not have insurance you can still negotiate with them for a settlement the process is generally the same write a demand letter to the insurer you might want to negotiate a settlement settling a dispute is usually faster cheaper and less stressful than a lawsuit you can begin the settlement process by writing a letter to the boat owner s insurer the demand letter should include the following 14 x research source a summary of the incident provide the who what where when and how a claim that the defendant is at fault be sure to mention that the defendant was operating the boat with a blood alcohol content above the legal limit a description of your injuries and the treatment you have received go into moderate detail also mention any painkillers you received the total amount you have spent on medical treatment a demand for compensation remember you are beginning negotiations accordingly you should demand double the amount you think your injury is worth for example if your injuries are worth 40 000 then demand 80 000 a threat to sue in court if you can t reach a resolution mail the letter mail the letter certified mail return receipt requested so that you know when it is received remember to keep a copy for your records receive a counteroffer the insurer should send you a letter in return which should contain a counter offer don t be surprised if the counter offer is extremely low for example you might have demanded 80 000 but the insurer will counter with 20 000 you should avoid firing off an angry letter or picking up the phone and yelling at the insurer 15 x research source instead put the letter aside and come back to it a day later attempt to negotiate you should respond to any low counter offer by explaining in more detail your pain and suffering injuries and dropping the amount of your demand only a little 16 x research source ideally you and the insurer will then go back and forth each moving closer to what the other side proposes unfortunately you will likely not get very far in negotiations before litigation most insurance companies use software to determine their offer and will most likely not veer too far away from that first offer they probably will not be willing to negotiate much as pre litigation they don t have much flexibility you may have better luck negotiating after the discovery is complete as much more information will be revealed during this time remember that negotiation is voluntary if the insurer cannot give you the amount that you feel you deserve then you can break off negotiations draft a settlement agreement you should formalize any agreement in a settlement agreement signed by both parties this will be the contract between the parties as the person bringing the lawsuit you probably have to give the boat operator a release from future lawsuits based on your injuries 17 x research source if you negotiated without a lawyer then take a draft of your settlement agreement to a lawyer and ask them to review it you want to make sure you aren t signing away important rights in your agreement find the correct court to sue in you can t sue the boat operator anywhere instead you can generally sue them in the county where they live or in the county where the accident happened you may have other options for example if the boat operator does business in your area you might be able to sue there talk to an attorney about where you can sue you should also think about suing in small claims court especially if your injuries weren t severe small claims courts are set up so that people can represent themselves without a lawyer small claims courts have maximums you can sue for which differ depending on the state for example in tennessee the maximum is 25 000 in rhode island by contrast the maximum is 2 500 18 x research source create a complaint you start a lawsuit by filing a complaint with the court this document identifies you as the plaintiff the person bringing the lawsuit and the boat operator owner as the defendant the person sued the complaint also includes background information on the dispute and makes your demand for money compensation 19 x trustworthy source national paralegal college law shelf online education resource from the national paralegal college go to source many courts have printed forms you can fill in you should check with the court clerk small claims courts in particular have these forms 20 x research source 21 x research source if no form is available then you will need to find a sample and use it as a guide 22 x research source of course if you hire a lawyer then they should do everything for you including drafting and filing a complaint file the complaint with the court when you finish the complaint make several copies you will want one for your records you also might need to file several copies with the court take your copies and the original to the court clerk ask to file 23 x research source the clerk should stamp your copies with the filing date pay a filing fee you probably have to pay a fee to file your lawsuit the amount will differ by court so call ahead and ask for the amount and the acceptable methods of payment don t assume a court accepts cash personal checks or credit cards if you can t afford the fee ask the court clerk if a fee waiver is available you typically will have to fill out a form and report your monthly income and living expenses notify the defendant of the lawsuit you need to give the defendant notice that you are suing them this notice consists of two things a copy of your complaint and a summons which is a document you can get from the court clerk 24 x research source you then need to arrange for service to be made you can t serve the papers yourself generally you can have someone 18 or older make hand delivery on the defendant for example you could ask a neighbor to deliver it you might also be able to pay a professional process server to make hand delivery in some counties you can pay the sheriff or constable a small fee to make delivery for you ask the court clerk read the defendant s response the defendant has a set amount of time in which to respond to your lawsuit typically they will file an answer in this document the defendant responds to each allegation you made in your complaint either admitting denying or claiming insufficient knowledge to admit or deny 25 x research source the defendant can also raise affirmative defenses in a bui accident there probably won t be many defenses the defendant can raise however if you took too long to bring a lawsuit then the defendant could argue you violated the statute of limitations generally you have two years to bring the lawsuit though this length of time will differ by state if you have a lawyer they will receive the defendant s response always ask your lawyer for copies of any document in your case so that you can keep up with what is going on engage in pre trial fact finding this fact finding phase is called discovery and it is a major part of any lawsuit in the u s during discovery you and the defendant swap information so that there are no surprises at trial the following are different discovery techniques you can use 26 x research source requests for production of documents you can get a copy of any document or inspect any object if you think it would be helpful to your case for example you might want to inspect the boat that injured you requests for admission you can state facts and ask the defendant to admit or deny them for example you could ask the defendant to admit that they drank beer while on the boat interrogatories these are written questions the defendant answers under oath for example you could use an interrogatory to ask the defendant what witnesses they intend to call at trial depositions in a deposition you can ask a witness questions in person which they answer under oath a court reporter takes down the questions and answers depositions are a good way to feel out what a witness knows for example someone might have been on the water when the accident occurred you can ask questions in a deposition to find out what they saw re enter negotiations after discovery ends you may enter into negotiations again it is very unlikely that the case will settle before discovery is complete so now is the time when you can go back and forth with the insurance company or other party describing your hardships in greater detail and lowering your demand slightly consider using a mediator for this process a mediator is an objective third party who will sit down with both parties and try to help guide them toward a mutually agreed upon settlement 27 x research source mediation is more informal and much quicker and less expensive than a trial in addition anything that is said in these sessions is private whereas everything said in court is available to the public 28 x research source the cost for mediation is split between parties it is a voluntary process so both sides must agree to take part 29 x research source mediation is a particularly good idea if you want to try and remain on good terms with the other person because it allows both people to speak freely about their feelings and discuss practical solutions 30 x research source identify your witnesses go through all of your papers and identify who you want to testify on your own behalf remember that a witness can only testify as to what they know personally a witness can t testify to gossip or second hand information 31 x research source helpful witnesses typically include anyone who witnessed the accident the police officer who investigated the accident your doctor or therapist who can testify about your injuries family and friends who can testify to changes in your mood or lifestyle as a result of your injuries make exhibits you can use a document as an exhibit and introduce it into evidence at trial you will also have to give the defendant a copy of all of your exhibits make multiple copies one for you one for the court and one for the defendant you can turn a document into an exhibit by placing an exhibit sticker in a corner of the document if you have a picture then you can put the sticker on the back you can get stickers from an office supply store or from the court clerk defend against a summary of judgement motion there is a possibility that the defendant will file a summary of judgement motion before you get to trial this may be done if you have more than one claim and the defendant wants to try to eliminate one of those claims a summary of judgement motion is filed when one party feels that both parties are in agreement about the most important facts and that the law is on their side 32 x research source you will have a certain amount of time to respond with an opposition to motion for summary judgement you will need to submit evidence that either proves the defendant s arguments about the law are incorrect or evidence that the facts aren t as straight forward as the defendant says and that a trial is necessary to determine the truth 33 x research source got to trial if you didn t settle your lawsuit then you will need to go to trial personal injury trials tend to follow the same sequence the common parts of a personal injury trial include 34 x research source jury selection either you or the defendant might want a jury if you want a jury then you should definitely have a lawyer represent you jury selection is a process of elimination the judge questions a panel of potential jurors and you can ask the judge to dismiss any juror that is biased opening statements these provide the jurors with a roadmap of what the evidence will be presentation of your witnesses you will present witnesses and evidence first you will probably also have to testify on your behalf cross examination of the defense witnesses the defendant gets to put on a case after you you can cross examine the defense witnesses closing arguments each side sums up the evidence and explains how it supports their case jury verdict the judge will read the jury its instructions and then allow them to retire for deliberations in many states juries no longer have to be unanimous in personal injury lawsuits instead you might win if nine or 10 out of 12 jurors agree with you enforce your court judgment winning at trial is only half the battle you also need to enforce your judgment hopefully the defendant will pay up or make plans to pay you in monthly installments however the defendant might resist paying you you typically will only have to worry about this if the defendant is not insured or the award exceeds their insurance in that case you can do the following garnish the defendant s wages you can file for garnishment with the court which will then send notice to the defendant s employer to withhold a percentage of the defendant s salary each pay period 35 x research source put liens on the defendant s property you might also be able to get a judgment lien put on the defendant s home or another property if the defendant wants to sell the property then he or she needs to pay you first get the defendant s licenses suspended in some states you can also get a defendant s professional licenses suspended you might also be able to get a driver s license suspended the threat of suspension often induces a defendant to pay up see collect a court ordered judgment for more information,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to paint a fiberglass canoe,after years of use and storage the paint on fiberglass canoes starts to look chalky and faded luckily you can bring your fiberglass canoe back to life relatively easily with a new paint job first clean and sand the canoe to prepare it for painting make sure to repair any major cracks or gouges with a gelcoat repair kit as well then apply 2 fresh coats of marine paint using a paintbrush and a small paint roller your canoe will be looking like new and ready for the water again in just a few days,check the forecast and pick 3 days of clear dry weather to paint your canoe you ll be working outdoors for this job and you ll have to let the canoe dry overnight a couple of times make sure you start working on a clear dry day when there are at least 2 more rain free days coming up you can move the canoe inside a garage or other covered storage space overnight if you want but you ll still have to let the canoe dry for several hours after each coat of paint before you can pick it up to move it put the canoe upside down on a pair of sawhorses outside pick an outside area with plenty of room to work such as a clear yard or driveway set up 2 sawhorses and flip the canoe upside down on top of them to expose the entire hull for painting 1 x research source you need to work somewhere outside since you will be using water to clean the canoe as well as making a mess when you sand it it s also best to work outside for the ventilation because you ll be working with chemicals as well spray the entire canoe down using a power washer set up your power washer near the canoe and connect it to a hose turn it on and spray down the entire canoe with plain water to remove any dirt and grime 2 x research source if you don t have a power washer you can rent one at many home improvement centers or hardware stores make sure to wear eye protection and closed toe shoes while operating a power washer if you are using a gas powered pressure washer wear earplugs as well since they are louder than electric power washers let the canoe air dry completely before proceeding wait for all the water from power washing to evaporate run your hands over the hull of the canoe when it looks dry to make sure 3 x research source you can wipe down the hull with a towel and then let it air dry for a shorter time if you want to speed up the process repair any deep gouges with a gelcoat repair kit examine the hull for any deep cracks or gouges mix together a 2 part gelcoat repair kit according to the manufacturer s instructions and press the gelcoat into the cracks using the mixing stick let the gelcoat cure for 8 hours before proceeding with sanding 4 x research source if there are any minor scratches you don t need to worry about repairing them they will disappear as you sand and paint the canoe scrape off any stickers using a utility knife use the edge of a utility knife to pry up the edges of any stickers or decals to loosen them peel them off in sections as you go until you get them completely off 5 x research source if there is any sticker residue left after you remove the stickers themselves you can rub it off with acetone put on protective eyewear and a dust mask always wear a dust mask and eye protection when you are sanding fiberglass the particles can be very harmful to your lungs or eyes work gloves are optional if you want to protect your hands against any slips use an orbital electric sander and 120 grit sandpaper to rough up the old paint fit an orbital sander with a 120 grit sanding disk turn on the sander and pass it along the entire hull of the canoe working lengthways until you have roughed up the entire old coat of paint 6 x research source you don t have to worry about removing all the old paint the goal is to just give the hull and even rough coat that the new paint will stick to wipe down the canoe with a tack cloth to remove all the dust use a clean tack cloth to wipe all the dust from sanding off the hull of the canoe make sure it is totally clean before you proceed to paint it 7 x research source a tack cloth is a special kind of cloth used for wiping up dust from surfaces before painting the sticky or tacky surface picks up loose particles of dust much better than any other kind of cloth tape off all non fiberglass parts on the canoe with masking tape cover up any metal or wood pieces along the hull such as gunwales and end caps with masking tape this will protect them while you paint so you don t have to worry about getting any paint on them by accident 8 x research source gunwales are the rims along the top side of the hull and end caps are coverings at the front or back of the canoe where the gunwales meet mix up to 1 part paint thinner with 9 parts marine paint this will thin the paint to help it coat the fiberglass better use a paint mixing stick to stir the paint thinner and marine paint thoroughly together in a can or paint tray so the mixture is no more than 10 thinner and at least 90 paint 9 x research source it s ok to use less thinner but any more than 10 will make the paint too liquidy marine paint is a type of oil based paint made specifically for boats it creates a durable surface that endures prolonged contact with water and is easy to clean you can buy it at a marine supply shop paint store home improvement center or online apply the first coat of marine paint using a combination of a brush and roller use a paint roller to roll on marine paint to the large areas of the hull working in areas approximately 2 ft 0 61 m in diameter apply paint near the gunwales end caps and any other areas where it s difficult to roll paint onto using a paintbrush 10 x research source if there are any bubbles in the paint that you apply with the roller you can smooth them out with your paintbrush it s easiest to use a small paint roller such as a 4 in 10 cm roller you can use a paintbrush of the same size or slightly smaller for the hard to roll spots you could also use a sprayer as an alternative method to apply the paint just keep in mind this method can be much messier let the first coat of paint dry for 24 hours the paint needs to dry a full 24 hours before you can recoat it it will be dry to the touch in 1 2 hours and dry enough to handle in 4 6 hours 11 x research source if you plan to move the canoe into a garage or other storage space to leave it overnight wait 4 6 hours before picking it up and moving it sand the canoe lightly using 120 grit sandpaper give the whole first coat of paint 1 pass using your orbital sander and a 120 grit sanding disk this will rough it up again so the second coat of paint sticks to it well 12 x research source remember to wear a dust mask any time you are sanding the canoe so you don t inhale paint or fiberglass particles wipe away the dust from sanding using a tack cloth use a clean tack cloth to wipe down the whole canoe again before you apply a second coat any dust particles will interfere with the paint sticking to the hull 13 x research source if you don t have a tack cloth you can wipe down the canoe using a clean cloth dampened with acetone to remove the dust apply a second coat of paint using the same method as the first work in areas of about 2 ft 0 61 m in diameter and apply paint using your paint roller use your paintbrush to paint around the gunwales end caps and any other hard to roll areas 14 x research source you can repeat the process for a third coat if you aren t happy with how it looks yet but 2 coats is generally enough wait at least 48 hours before putting your canoe in the water the paint will be dry after 24 hours but wait 48 hours before using the canoe to be extra sure that the paint is fully cured it s ok to move the boat inside for storage and drying after 4 6 hours when the paint is dry enough to handle 15 x research source double check the manufacturer s instructions for the marine paint you used for any specific info about drying

how to build a boat,little boats are perfect for trips around the lake they fit on the roof of your car and in the back of truck beds making them perfect for spontaneous camping trips this article describes a method for building a canoe 12 x30 with 11 depth using a stitch and glue style of boat building,rip and attach the plywood sheets rip two sheets of 4 x8 x1 8 door skin plywood into 24 wide sheets stack and attach these 24 x 8 sheets together at the top and bottom edges with small nails in a few spots mark out your measurements lay out the attached panels and mark a vertical line every 12 along the entire 8 length of the plywood from these 12 vertical lines measurements are made by marking points on these lines a long stick or batten is used to draw a line between these points giving the outlines of the canoe s panels make sure the lines drawn for the panels are all fair smooth curves only three panels are needed per side the four half sheets of 8 plywood are used to make 12 boat panels then these 12 panels are put together in matching pairs with butt blocks or scarf joints to make up the total 6 panels or 3 per side finger joints using a dovetail template and a router will also make good joints to join the panels you have to allow for the 1 overlap of each panel when making the finger joint as this gives the boat an attractive finished look this system makes a simple but very nice boat and has a recognizable canoe look and shape with a gentle v bottom rather than a flat bottom cut the panels once the panels have been drawn out and checked for nice curving lines it s time to cut them out using a saber saw once you have cut the panels out use a woodworkers rasp file to smooth up the edges as close to the lines on the panel as possible a small block plane could be used instead now you can put the panel pieces together as stated above with finger joints scarves or butt blocks more specific instructions on how to do each of these joints is easily available online drill holes in the panels now that the panels are done it s time to drill some holes along the bottom edges about 3 8 from the top and bottom edges of each panel this job is easier and faster if you lay the two matching panels the corresponding panels on either side together and drill the holes this boat has only three panels per side with each of the three being the same on either side of the canoe stitch up the panels get some bailing copper or any soft easy to bend wire from the hardware store cut short pieces of wire about 3 long you will need quite a few of these about half a pie pan full however you can always cut more if you need them 1 x research source lay the two bottom panels on top of each other and wire the center bottom edges together but don t pull the wire too tight leave the wire loose so you can open the bottom two panels up like a book this will be the bottom of your canoe now starting in the center wire stitch on the next panel putting a few stitches on each side of the center line keep working from side to side doing a few on each side until you get to the ends when you get to the upper panels line up the ends and stitch them together try to keep them as even as possible with a nice canoe end curve you should begin to see the canoe coming together at this point 2 x research source review your work with the panels stitched together put a stick about 1 square and 29 long at the top center inside of the canoe this will hold it to the right width and shape now stand back and look it over is it fair with nice flowing lines and no twist if not tighten or loosen the wire stitches as necessary or even add a stitch if needed make sure it looks pleasing to the eye check to see if there is any twist in the canoe using winding sticks make sure the panel edges are all sitting on top of each other nice and tight and not overlapping at any point you can also do a trick called cutting a transition joint which is a 1 4 or 3 8 notch cut 24 36 depending on the width of the panel and length of the canoe into the bottom front edge of the top panels this gives you a nice smooth side more detailed instructions on how to do a transition joint can be found in many books covering stitch and glue boat building or on the internet finally be sure that the panels are not pushed out from each other at any one point you want nice smooth stitched seams apply some epoxy mix up just enough epoxy to cover the joints between the panels this is done by using a mixing cup 8oz and a stick then use a foam paint brush to apply the epoxy to the joints try to cover each edge about an inch on either side of the joint making sure that it soaks into the joint to get a good bond make it look like you re painting a strip down the joint remember that the joints of the panels and stems only get epoxied on the inside for now repeat this process for each of the joints try not to let the epoxy run down the sides of the panels you only want it on the joint no runs if you have any runs use another brush to wipe them up this just makes life easier when it comes to sanding the inside of the boat remember to check the outside of the seams for runs as well put two coats of epoxy on the joints and stems stems are the ends of the boat letting the epoxy dry before re coating be sure the stems are pulled tightly together using the stitches before applying the epoxy don t use clamps to pull the stems ends together stitches only each coat of epoxy needs about 24 hours to dry so try to have a little patience while dreaming of that smooth glassy lake remove the wire stitches when the epoxy is dry check to ensure that the joints are fully epoxied with no dry spots areas without epoxy if they are you can start cutting and pulling out the wire stitches do this with care as the panels joints are still fragile at this point try not to break the epoxy join and don t leave any wire in the boat if you pull out a wire and the joint opens put a stitch back in and epoxy that joint area again apply a mixture of epoxy and wood flour once all of the wire is out mix up some epoxy and wood flour very fine sawdust you can find wood flour at any boat building supplier this mixture is known as a fillet 3 x research source mix the wood flour and epoxy to a smooth creamy mixture it shouldn t be runny apply this fillet to the joints that you put the epoxy on make a nice smooth bead about 1 1 2 2 wide over the center of each joint then apply a smooth bead of fillet to the inside of the stem ends make the stem end fillets about 3 4 thick on the inside although this adds weight it has the benefit of making the stem nice and strong however you should be careful not to add too much epoxy as it can become brittle add fiberglass tape to the inside of the boat now it s time to add a 3 wide fiberglass tape which is cloth like rather than sticky to the freshly fillet coated joints and stems 4 x research source apply another coat of epoxy smoothing it over the fiberglass until it turns clear to make the joint as smooth as possible add just enough epoxy to turn the fiberglass clear then use a squeegee to remove any excess remember that applying too much epoxy is as bad as applying too little be gentle while doing this as you don t want to push the fresh fillet mix out of the joint when you push down on the fiberglass with the squeegee when you get to the stems add a 3 wide strip of fiberglass to the inside of the stems over the fillet allow the stem end fiberglass to come down over the center strip of fiberglass tape as this will make one complete strong joint you will need to add a second coat of epoxy to these tapes after the first coat cures again waiting 24 hours between each coat sand the boat once the second coat of epoxy has dried it s time to turn the boat over enlist the help of another person to turn the boat over remember to be very gentle as the boat is still fragile at this point 5 x research source now use a fine rasp woodworkers file to smooth over the edges of the bottom and lower panel joints being careful not to splinter the thin plywood then use sandpaper 80 grit to smooth up the joint edge being careful not to sand too deep into the plywood sand the entire outside of the boat using a 120 grit sandpaper make sure to clean up any drips and runs from the epoxy that ran through the joints remember to sand with care don t sand into the thin layers of the 1 8 plywood as this takes away from the canoe s outer skin and leaves hollow flat spots when the sanding is done wipe off the excess dust using a cheesecloth then use compressed air and a clean cloth to remove the more stubborn dust sweep the floor and wait until the dust has settled before proceeding apply epoxy and fiberglass to the outside of the boat once the dust has settled you can apply a thin even coat of epoxy to the smooth bare wood on the outside of the canoe using a good foam brush again 24 hours to wait for the epoxy to dry lightly sand the epoxy coated outside of the boat with 120 grit paper this is only necessary to provide a tooth for the next coat of epoxy and fiberglass to hold to now it s time to add fiberglass cloth to the outside of the boat the fiberglass can weigh anywhere between 4 oz and 8oz depending on the intended use of the canoe the larger the fiberglass the heavier the canoe will be as the heavier fiberglass requires more epoxy use the same technique of applying the fiberglass to the outside of the boat then applying a layer of epoxy on top if you have never done this before it s a good idea to read as much as you can about it first being informed will help you do a really nice job on the boat trim the fiberglass and epoxy you will need to trim the epoxy and fiberglass cloth approximately two hours after applying just before the epoxy starts to harden if you wait until the epoxy hardens it will be very hard to trim the excess fiberglass cloth from the edges of the canoe to trim the fiberglass cloth use a razor knife and trim off the cloth along the gunnel s edges be gentle while trimming try not to pull on the cloth as it is still wet and it will move and cause you problems add another coat of epoxy then sand the boat after the first coat of epoxy has been applied to the fiberglass cloth and is dry add another coat to fill the weave of the cloth giving you a nice smooth surface be aware that it might take more than two coats to fill the weave of the cloth depending on the type and weight of the cloth with the fiberglass on and trimmed give the outside a light sanding with 220 grit sandpaper then clean off all dust you can now clear coat or paint the boat turn the boat over carefully turn the boat right side up and place it in a cradle or in slings this is a good time to build a set of saw horses to set and cradle the canoe in so it won t move while you work on the inside attach the gunnels gunnels are the top rails of the canoe which are placed on the inside and outside edges on both sides of the canoe 6 x research source gunnels give a completed look to the canoe while also serving to protect the sides of the canoe as rub rails each gunnel should be about 1 1 1 4 x3 8 1 2 square with the top outside and inside edges rounded over use epoxy and brass or bronze screws to attach the gunnels at the front 24 30 of the gunnels you can use the epoxy and spring clamps to attach the gunnels to the canoe until the epoxy dries at the stem ends on top of the canoe you can fit small decks on top of the rails or between them if you take the time and effort to make a good fit flush decks look the best apply a second coat of clear varnish or paint keep in mind that you will have to do one or the other as epoxy alone will not last when exposed to the sun when you ve finished painting or varnishing the outside it s time to turn the canoe over and do the inside clear coat or paint sand epoxy and paint the inside of the boat sand the inside of the boat removing any drips or runs try to not sand through the top plywood layer when all the sanding is done it s time to coat the inside of the boat with for best results do this in two or three thin layers of epoxy waiting 24 hours between coats when this is all done you can sand the last coat lightly with a 120 grit sandpaper and then a 220 grit to get a really smooth finish wipe away any dust then paint or varnish the inside add seats you can add seats before or after you epoxy coat the inside of the boat 7 x research source all seats should be about 1 1 1 2 from the bottom of the canoe not hanging from the gunnels on a light canoe such as this one with a low freeboard it s best to keep the center of gravity as low in the boat as possible give the boat time to dry let the whole thing set for about a week this gives the layers of epoxy and finish time to dry completely,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles

how to build an ark,have you received a vision of calamity from on high are you the only remaining righteous soul on an earth awash in violence evil and corruption survive the oncoming flood buy building your very own ark and populating it with two of all living creatures male and female 1 x research source 6 genesis 19 see step 1 below to get started building an ark according to the specifications in the bible,pick a consistent conversion factor for converting cubits to modern measurements the bible tells us that god commanded noah to build the original ark to certain exact specifications said god to noah this is how you are to build it the ark is to be three hundred cubits long fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high 2 x research source 6 genesis 15 today these measurements are somewhat problematic because we don t know exactly how long a cubit is cubits are an ancient unit of measurement based on the distance from the elbow to the tips of the fingers so different cultures had different values for the length of one cubit generally speaking most ancient cultures had cubits that were between 17 5 and 20 6 inches 44 5 52 3 cm long 3 x research source the most important thing is to be consistent pick one cubit length and stick to it to ensure the proportions of your ark are correct for convenience s sake this guide will assume we re working with a type of cubit called common cubits so our conversion factor will be 1 cubit 18 inches 45 7 cm buy or cut lots of cypress wood the bible tells us that the original ark was made exclusively from cypress wood 4 x research source 6 gen 14 today cypress refers to a number of coniferous trees and shrubs in the family family cupressaceae noah may have used mediterranean cypress cupressus sempervirens a variety of cypress tree native to the mediterranean and levant whichever type of cypress you use you ll need enough to build the hull of a ship three hundred cubits long fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high in addition to the deck roof and flooring below deck if for convenience we assume a box shaped ark and 18 inch 45 7 cm cubits our 300 50 30 cubit ark will require at least 114 750 square feet of cypress wood the actual amount will likely be more than this as you ll need to build a hull that s more than one layer thick as well as a roof and flooring inside the ark build a curved wooden hull to fit the dimensions of the bible for your ark to be able to float in the tumultuous waters of a world destroying flood it will need to be of very sturdy construction you ll want to build a thick hull with a wide gently curving cross section that tapers at either end add a keel a vertical fin running the length of the bottom of the hull for added stability after you ve built the main hull add horizontal and diagonal cross beams stretching across the inside of the hull to increase the strength of the ark s walls the ark is truly a massive undertaking assuming 18 inch 45 7 cm cubits the hull of your ark should be 450 feet 137 2 m long 75 feet 22 9 m wide and 45 feet 13 7 m high the process of building the hull can be sped up greatly with modern tools and construction methods but if you re using only ancient tools it may take months or years add flooring inside the ark and a door on the side the bible tells us that god commanded noah put a door in the side of the ark and make lower middle and upper decks 5 x research source 6 gen 16 adding multiple decks will allow you to make the most of the vertical space within the ark storing as many animals as possible while adding a door to the side of the ark makes it possible for land animals to easily board the ark the bible doesn t specify dimensions for the different decks within the ark so use your best judgement you may for instance want the bottom deck to be taller than the others to accommodate the biggest animals like elephants and giraffes add a roof a firm sturdy roof is an important part of your ark the original world destroying flood was caused by forty days and forty nights of rain 6 x research source 7 gen 4 in the event of a similar situation it s important to have some way to keep the rain from gathering below deck and sinking your ark the bible tells us that god commanded noah to make a roof for the ark leaving below the roof an opening one cubit high all around 7 x research source 6 gen 16 be sure to build your roof so that the edges of the roof reach over the edges of the upper deck you want any rainwater to drain away from the upper deck and into the waters of the flood coat the wood of the hull with pitch it s obviously extremely important for your ark to be as waterproof as possible god knew this and commanded noah to coat the ark with pitch inside and out 8 x research source 6 gen 14 pitch is a thick viscous resin not unlike tar that in ancient times was used to waterproof boats pitch can be made from natural plants especially pine trees or from petroleum naturally noah probably used the former fill your ark with animals congratulations you ve built a modern day ark based on the original specifications given to noah by god now all you need to do is find male female pairs of every major species of bird and land animal to repopulate the earth after the apocalyptic flood however according to the bible some animals are more important than others consider god s original advice to noah when gathering animals take with you seven pairs of every kind of clean animal a male and its mate and one pair of every kind of unclean animal a male and its mate and also seven pairs of every kind of bird male and female to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth 9 x research source 7 gen 2 3 clean and unclean refer to ancient jewish customs governing the suitability of certain types of animals for eating and sacrifice the distinction between which animals are clean and which are unclean is somewhat complex but in general clean animals are 10 x research source

how to construct an overnight pontoon boat,building an overnight pontoon boat can be a challenge but with some luck at the local salvage yard some hard work and mainly some very creative designing it can be done,lay out your basic design come up with reasonable and practical requirements since under building will leave you with less deck space than you need and overbuilding will send you to davey jones locker with weight and expense 1 x research source choose a practical place to build your project the first concern should be getting your ship to the harbor safely and in one piece this will mean having a large enough suitable trailer to haul it and a vehicle capable of pulling it so a very large craft might be more simply assembled on the water to begin with if a private waterfront lot or private pond is available 2 x research source locate suitable pontoons since the vessel must be seaworthy the flotation is a critical factor in the design some scrapyards may have very large pvc water pipe plastic drums or even military drop tanks from surplus the drop tanks are ideal since they are rust resistant and contain honeycombed baffle material which makes them extremely strong plus they are aerodynamic which would roughly equal hydrodynamic the main thing is to find something which displaces sufficient water to give flotation and stability to your vessel select the material you are going to frame the boat with for this article we will use pvc water pipe as the flotation since it may be the most readily available material and we will discuss attaching the support framing made of 2x4 treated southern pine lumber the example boat dimensions will be 8 feet 2 4 m wide and 16 feet 4 9 m long these dimensions are just for reference and with a little design change you may adjust them to fit your own needs lay two sections of 12 inch 30 5 cm diameter pvc drain pipe parallel on a flat level surface with the ends capped and sealed to keep water out this can be done with a glued slip cap or a no hub band and cap assembly these materials are quite expensive so hopefully you will find them in a salvage yard or from surplus materials at an underground utility company another possibility would be to make a wooden plug and fasten it in place using epoxy and screws cut 8 foot 2 4 m long 2x4 treated pine boards 7 foot 2 1 m 9 inches 22 9 cm long and lay them out down the length of your pipe on 24 inch 61 0 cm centers nail a band across the ends of these joists using a 2x4 treated board 16 feet 4 9 m long on each side this is the support frame for your vessel 3 x research source using self drilling coarse thread 2 1 2 inch 6 4 cm hex head tech screws attach a 21 inch 53 3 cm block of treated 2x4 laid flat between each of your joists to nail the joists to two screws per blocking should be sufficient toenail or screw the joists to these blocking lay a 1 inch 2 5 cm wide 16 gauge galvanized strap diagonally across the top of your deck boards from corner to corner each direction this is the bracing which will keep the deck square during the rest of your building process measure the deck across opposite corners and rack it until the measurements are equal at each diagonal fasten the strapping to each joist either by drilling the strapping and nailing with 16d 3 1 2 inch hot dipped galvanized nails or screwing with the tech screws used for securing your blocking install your deck you may use 1x4 or 1x6 treated lumber or treated marine grade plywood you should choose the driest least heavy material available since the two 12 inch 30 5 cm pvc pipes have a total displacement of only about 1572 pounds and this will factor in how much superstructure you will be able to build on deck using pressure treated yellow pine in the dimensions quoted here you have a gross weight of approximately 600 lbs plus the weight of your pipe pontoons as you can see at this point you have a maximum load weight of about 900 pounds so this will limit the on deck construction to very light materials and minimal gear 4 x research source decide on whether you will need a shelter for overnight excursions this will be a critical factor in whether you decide on extra flotation or upgrading your design to a larger pontoon size 16 or even 24 inch 61 0 cm pipe for example for basic camping a small tent can be erected on the deck using screws or even nails in place of tent stakes consider safety this step should be incorporated in every aspect of the construction and use of your boat the idea here is giving some thought as to who will be riding the craft small children people who are not capable swimmers and other persons who may be at risk of drowning should be a high priority of concern and you may choose to install handrails for safety around the deck the options here include but are not limited to using schedule 80 3 4 inch 205 1 cm pvc pipe with glued slip joint couplings for posts and rails using metal pipe posts with rope or cable rails or building a wood handrail framed up from and screwed to the deck launch your new boat if you have built near the water you may simply jack the boat up slide dollies under the pontoons and slide it into the water otherwise you will need to use jacks to lift it high enough to back a flat bed trailer underneath it tie it down securely and haul it to a launching point,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to make a sail,ships and boats of all sizes have harnessed the power of wind for centuries sailing boats have continued to use sails to this day for recreational sports and hobbies whether you re looking for a calm day on the water or to compete in a race making your own sail can be a beneficial skill,draw a basic outline whether you want to add an emblem or are designing for efficiencies sketch out what you want the final sail to look like so that you have a jumping off point look to other similar boats for inspiration 1 x research source research the dimensions of similar sails and have an idea of what kind of sailing you d like to do this gives basic reference points to research and execute find a suitable workspace depending on the size of the vessel making your sail can be a huge undertaking ensure that you have a workspace that can not only house a large piece of material but can also give you room to maneuver while making a lot of noise 2 x research source address your sewing needs whether you re a hobbyist or professional you will need an industrial sewing machine that is able to do a zigzag stitch using v69 thread it may be wise to let a professional take care of the sewing to ensure safety and maximum durability 3 x research source if you are planning to sew the sail yourself you will also need a special sewing table to be able to support the industrial sewing machine this table needs to be about twice the size of a table tennis table in order to support the size of the sail 4 x research source know the boom and mast dimensions measure the boat you intend to use the sale for in order to calculate the appropriate size of your sail if you have a short boom and a tall mast then that is a high aspect if you have a long boom and a short mast it is a low aspect 5 x research source shorter booms give you more maneuverability draw the front of the sail the front of the sail is called the luff curve the luff curve is the most important part of the sail because the rest of the sail s integrity depends on it the luff curve at front of the sail relates to how your mast will bend 6 x research source the luff curve won t match the curve of the mast the top third of the luff curve will be slight and the bottom of the curve close to the boom will be greater than the mast curve there are different theories on what the perfect luff curve should be so research how to optimize the luff curve for your prefered type of sailing 7 x research source add in battens battens keep the shape of a sail and come in full or half where full battens are for high performance 8 x research source battens are attached to the sail using two types of pockets pockets that you can t adjust and pockets that you can adjustable pockets allow you to adjust your sail more to wind conditions if you want more stability add more battens however use less battens to make your boat easier to manoeuvre and more lightweight 9 x research source evaluate where to add seams seams on your sail allow you to be strategic with choosing material that will optimize your sail s performance they also allow you to shape your sail more easily a panel means that you have stitched different materials on a sail 10 x research source use heavier materials near the bottom of the sail seams also help to optimize the amount of material you use make a pattern create your sail pattern as you would a dress translate your sail into real dimensions using newspaper cheap fabric or another thin piece of paper double check all your measurements and cut out your panels when ready the pattern should be pliable and easily moved in order to cut it out of your sail fabric 11 x research source tape fabric or newspaper together for more surface area when creating a large sail the luff curve and shaping the seam will create a three dimensional sail so don t worry if your sail lies flat as you construct your pattern choose a fabric research what fabric works best for your sailing needs and budget monofilm is an economical choice but ensure you use robust material when constructing the luff and foot of your sail 12 x research source pentex taffeta scrim laminate is very durable but on the higher price end there are also special polyesters and laminated woven fibers commercial sales are commonly made from a material called dacron which is a type of polyester 13 x expert source nitzan levy sailing instructor expert interview 24 april 2020 ensure that the material you choose resist stretching and can withstand rips heavy monofilm and woven sailcloth are common choices start with a central panel place your pattern onto your chosen material and outline the edges of the panel before cutting any material understand that the edges of each panel will need to be stuck together and then sewn 14 x research source cut out your pattern once you have outlined your pattern onto your material including battens and seams you may now cut out your pattern when creating a seam with shape you want the shape to be about 35 from the luff 15 x research source stitch the materials move from panel to panel while leaving extra cloth at the external edges of the sail it s best to trim and adjust the sail shape once all panels are sewn together stick and sew two panels at a time until the sail is all in one piece you can now trim it to your design on the table and draw on the batten pockets reinforce the material using dacron tape or reinforced monofilm tape reinforce the seams you can also glue a layer of cloth on either side of the material for added strength 16 x research source fortify the foot and the batten pockets there will be a high degree of force applied to these areas so ensure that they can withstand that amount of tension depending on the type of sail attach the luff once you have dealt with the batten pockets 17 x research source create the sleeve for the mast measure the width of existing sails and adjust your sail accordingly sleeves can either be a single piece or made from a number of pieces of material but ensure that the head is reinforced and capable to withstand the strain from the mast tip create your sleeve so it fits down to the foot batten 18 x research source create an adjustable head for your sleeve if this is your first attempt at a sail use pulleys from old sails or get them from a sail maker,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to make a solid boat mast,most folks will never need to make a mast for a boat but they may wonder how it s done you may find yourself wanting to make something mast shaped only smaller one day however maybe you d like to make small flagpole or even something as small as a walking cane this article shows you how to make any square in cross section length of wood into a perfectly round one without using a lathe most boat masts are tapered and this method works with either a straight or tapered mast,determine the length of your mast as well as its diameter along the length for instance you may have a mast that is 3 in diameter at the base tapering up to 3 1 4 1 up the mast and then tapering down to 2 starting 1 from the top here s a picture with an absurdly shortened mast for clarity select a light straight grained wood for your mast sitka spruce is wonderful but boat builders have been using whatever was available for ages cut your wood to be a little wider thicker and longer than your mast glue up two boards to get the desired thickness if needed use a jointer or a hand plane to plane one face of your mast perfectly flat mark the center line of your mast on this planed face stretch a string tacked at the midpoint widthwise of both ends of the mast and pull it taut make small pencil marks directly beneath the string to mark your center line use a long straight strip of wood called a batten the length of your mast or longer to connect these marks and create a center line along the face of the mast repeat this process on the opposite face to create a center line there as well it doesn t matter if the two faces are perfectly parallel to each other just yet mark the width of your mast along its length using your center line to make sure that your widths are centered in this case you d measure out 3 at the base i e 1 1 2 to either side of the centerline move up 1 measure out 3 1 4 wide move up one more foot measure out 3 1 4 again since this is where the transition to the top of the mast begins and then go to the top of the mast and measure out 2 wide repeat this process on the opposite face use your batten to connect the width marks along the edges of your mast on the planed face repeat this on the opposite face you now have an outline of the shape of your mast on two opposite faces cut the outline of your mast with the planed face down using a band saw circular saw etc cut close to but not right on your outline you now have two sawn faces one planed face and one untouched face plane each of your sawn faces flat and smooth making sure that they are perpendicular to the first flattened face check your progress with a combination square as you go you now have two tapered sides that are flat side to side and perpendicular to one face this means that they will also be parallel to each other repeat the steps for marking the center line and mast outlines on the two faces you just planed then cut the outline again for these two sides plane the sides that you just cut flat and perpendicular to their adjacent sides you now have a tapered spar that is square in cross section and is exactly the right width along its length use a compass to draw a series of circles along your mast that just touch the edges of the mast do this on all four sides at the very least draw circles at the top bottom and transitions of your tapers draw at least one circle in the midpoint of your tapers and at least one circle in the midpoint of your mast these circles will generate the points that you will eventually plane down to so take your time and be precise draw two lines that just touch the edges of your circle and that are perpendicular to the edge of your mast do this for each circle what you ve created here is a cross section view of your mast you ve got a box the current mast shape with a circle in it your final mast shape you can get by with only doing one vertical line next to your circle but the more reference points you make the more checks for accuracy you ll have put the point of your compass in the center of the circle and open up the compass until the pencil point just touches the corner of the box i e the point where the line goes off the edge of the mast lock in that measurement read the next 3 steps before making any marks you may want to take the shortcut described in step 18 to save time make the edge marks for the 8 sided mast take the compass with the setting you just locked in and placing the point as close to the corner of the box as you can tick off the distance on the line that makes up that side of the box make a little horizontal mark where the compass intersects the box line you can clamp a piece of wood to the mast so that your point is exactly half on and half off the mast go to the opposite side of the box and do this again now going up the line repeat this on each box line check to make sure that your tic marks are accurate by taking your combination square and checking that a 45 degree angle taken from the side of the mast and going through this marked point on the box line will just touch the circle in other words the tic mark you just made identifies the point on the side of your box where a 45 degree line that is tangent to your circle will just touch shortcut if you want to skip the part about using your compass you can create these tic marks on the box side using just your 45 degree combination square making sure that you draw your line so that it just touches the circle using both methods from time to time as a check is also a good idea mark the edges of the 16 sided mast set a protractor or in this case and much easier a protractor head on a ruler to 67 ½ degrees each corner of a 16 sided mast is 22 ½ degrees and 67 ½ is 90 degrees minus 22 ½ place the blade tangent to i e just touching your circle and mark on the box side where the blade crosses it draw a short horizontal line there as well repeat this around the circumference of the mast using at least one side of your box continue your lines past the box side to where they intersect if they intersect exactly on the centerline of the mast you know you re on target the picture to the right shows a quick summary of the lines drawn the whole point of making these is to get the proper intersections for the edges of your mast as you start planing it down connect the tic marks you ve made for the 8 sided mast along the length of your mast with a batten and draw the resulting lines in this photo the batten has been clamped to the mast this way you don t leave little nail holes in your mast from fastening the batten do the same again with the 16 sided lines you now have the edges of an 8 sided and a 16 sided mast drawn clamp your mast down using angled clamping blocks to hold it steady start planing the first corner plane down until you just connect the 8 sided edge marks on each of the adjoining faces when you re done planing down all four corners you ll have four new faces that look like this you can see that the non planed faces have guide marks on them for the 16 sided mast but of course the newly planed faces don t you ll need to add in guide marks for the 16 sided mast on these newly planed faces take your compass and measure the width of the 16 sided face transfer that width over to the planed side by putting the point of the compass on the existing 16 sided line and making a tic mark on the newly planed face in this photo the tic mark and line had been previously drawn so the compass is just in position to show how the line was measured place a batten connecting your marks and draw a line along it at this point you may need to do some minor adjustments if it looks like you won t get even widths between each of the 16 sides use your best judgment and be brave in this photo you can see where the upper line was adjusted to make it fit better with the other sides plane the corners down to these lines to get to a 16 sided mast now you don t have any guidelines to help you get from a 16 sided mast to a 32 sided one instead of making new longitudinal lines take a number of locations along the mast and connect the tips of the edges you ve created with lines like this it looks like a charlie brown shirt plane off the tips of this zig zag line leaving just small line segments behind this will give you a visual guide as to how much you re planing off it s not much just a few strokes of the plane suspend the mast so that you can both hold it steady and rotate it as you work it s useful to put screws in the end and fasten it to a pair of uprights clamped to workbenches here s a fancy box sander used to finish off the rounding you can make a simpler one by making a 3 sided box and stapling sandpaper in the open fourth side there are handles on this one as well as a cloth backing behind the sandpaper to help keep it from tearing clamps along the sides of the box hold the sandpaper in and these make it easy to change paper sand away when using the sanding box move in a long spiraling motion along the mast you can go straight back and forth for a few strokes but mostly use a long twisting motion around the mast as you go this helps to fair out any uneven spots start with 60 or 80 grit paper and work your way up the grits to 150 or so varnish starting with a slightly thinned varnish mixture to soak in follow this with a minimum of six coats of marine varnish eight to twelve coats are better and will save you work in the future,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to camo a boat,if you plan on using your boat for duck hunting or just want to give it a little extra pizazz you can paint it using a camouflage color scheme the process takes time but it is not too difficult and can usually be done by hand at a pretty cheap cost,elevate the boat position your boat on top of a boat stand so that it is off the ground yet low enough for you to access without much difficulty elevating the boat will make it easier for you to work on all sides 1 x research source if you do not have a boat stand to use you could also use cinder blocks a boat stand is preferable though since cinder blocks will cover a portion of the bottom and prevent you from painting it keep the boat right side up as you paint it you will need to paint both the inside and the outside of the boat in order to make the entire thing camouflaged so you need access to the inside of the boat by contrast the bottom of the boat will be hidden under water most of the time so ducks and similar prey are less likely to see it you should still camouflage as much of the bottom as you can reach though sand down the sides use a portable electric sander to smooth all the sides of the boat start with the inner part of the boat and sand the exterior sides afterward sanding the boat will remove any old paint or other inconsistencies as a result your final painting job will be smoother and neater if you do not have a portable electric sander you could use a sanding block instead clean the boat thoroughly combine soap and hot water in a large bucket and use the solution to scrub down all sides of the boat wash the boat using a hard bristled brush so that you can eliminate more debris in the process as you did while sanding the boat clean the interior before cleaning the exterior the cleaning solution you use should be very sudsy for best results use a soap that is specifically labeled for whatever material your boat is made from otherwise use liquid dish detergent for the best results you should also consider rinsing down the exterior sides of your washed boat with a water hose that has been fitted with a power sprayer nozzle it is vital that you let the boat dry completely before moving on with primer or paint you can either towel dry the boat or let it air dry prime the sides a good primer will protect the boat and also improve the final look of your boat after you paint it if you have an aluminum boat choose a primer with rust proofing otherwise any waterproof primer might be adequate thin the primer before using it doing so can make it easier for the primer to go on and to work its way into the tiny scratches on the side of the boat as such your boat will be better protected choose a good stencil you can purchase large stencils for the side of your boat online or in various stores with hunting and outdoor living products if you are not sure about where to start look for stencils of marsh grasses or cattails if you do not want to buy actual stencils you can create your own by holding actual cattails or swamp grasses up to your boat as you paint it you could also use skinny pieces of round pipe you could also cut actual stencils out of poster board print or sketch the design onto the board and cut out the portions that need o be filled in with your secondary paint 2 x research source do not use pieces of tape instead of actual stencils or stencil like elements tape will create harsh sharp lines and your camouflage will look more out of place as a result faded edges are preferable to sharp edges when you attach any type of stencil to your boat you will need to adhere it on securely with strong tape alternatively you could simply hold up the stencil to the boat side as you spray instead of fixing it in place a marsh grass or cattail pattern is usually the most typical pattern for a boat on the other hand you could opt for a more traditional sort of camouflage composed of randomly arranged wavy shapes the choice is ultimately a matter of personal preference 3 x research source determine your camo color scheme for practical use there are only a few color schemes that will actually help camouflage your boat in the water an earth tone scheme might help or you could opt for a marine oriented or navy oriented palette 4 x research source earth tone palettes make use of tans browns and the occasional deep green marine and navy oriented palettes blend shades of blue with shades of brown ultimately when you choose a color scheme think about the area you will be using your boat in and try to find three or four colors that will blend in with the surroundings of that area start with the lightest color take the lightest color involved in your pattern and paint the entire boat with one coating of that shade allow the paint to dry thoroughly for about 24 hours and apply a second coat that coat should also dry for about 24 hours note that you will not be using a stencil for this portion of the project the surface temperature of the boat should be at least 51 degrees fahrenheit 10 5 degrees celsius when you begin avoid painting the boat in temperatures lower than that since cooler temperatures may make it more difficult for the paint to spread and dry use a paint sprayer instead of a brush or roller in order to achieve the best results it is also important that you start with the lightest color rather than a darker shade a light hue will not show up beneath a dark overcoat but a dark paint will likely show through a light overcoat progress through the remaining colors apply your stencil to the side of the boat and use the darker colors in your camouflage palette to fill in the pattern work with the light to medium tones first and end with the darkest color you have choose paints that have a matte non reflective finish in water allow the paint to dry for a full 24 hours for this part of the process you can either use a paint sprayer or cans of spray paint cans of spray paint might be preferable since they will allow you to paint finer lines and details spray over the stencils in even strokes the part of the boat covered by your cattails or stencil backing will remain as your lightest color while the parts that are open will be painted in your secondary colors mist the color onto the boat by holding the paint can back at a distance spray up and down over the stencil with each color to get even coatings 5 x research source try not to make the pattern look too symmetrical or planned the lines of your pattern should be somewhat evenly spaced but they should each tilt at different angles and no set of lines should be spaced apart evenly with another set of lines apply a final clear coat use a paint sprayer to coat the entire boat in a single layer of clear matte or flat paint this clear coat can protect your paint job from scratches note that if you choose an oil based paint you can also help waterproof your paint job,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to build a boat blind,if you re hunting ducks or other waterfowl they may be able to see your boat and avoid flying near you boat blinds help conceal your boat and make it easier to approach the birds without them detecting you boat blinds can either have a solid pvc frame or a metal scissor frame that s collapsible when you aren t using it no matter which frame you build add camouflage to it so you aren t visible while you re on the water,measure the inside length and width of your boat use a measuring tape to find the width of the inside of your boat near the motor which is usually the widest point once you have the measurement for the width lock the measuring tape in place so it doesn t contract and move toward the front of your boat find the spot on your boat where the body just starts to get narrower measure the length from the back of your boat just in front of the motor to the spot where it narrows 1 x research source do not measure from the outside edges of the boat since your frame won t be able to fit inside cut 2 pieces of pvc pipe that match the inside length of the boat after you find the length transfer the measurements onto a piece of pvc pipe with a 2 in 5 1 cm diameter use a hacksaw to cut through the pipe at the mark you made making sure the cut is as straight as possible once you cut out the first piece of pvc pipe cut another piece that s the same size so you have 2 side pieces for your frame 2 x research source you can buy pvc pipes from your local hardware store the employees may be able to cut your length of pipe to size if you need them to split each length of pvc into 3 equal pieces take the measurement you found for the length and divide it by 3 to find how long each section should be mark the new measurements on your pvc pipes and cut through them with a hacksaw cutting your side pieces into smaller lengths lets you add side supports to your frame using t connections so you blind is more sturdy 3 x research source for example if the inside length of your boat is 9 feet 2 7 m then each section of pipe you cut will be 3 feet 0 91 m if you want you can cut the 3 pieces to size right away rather than cutting out the long pieces first glue the pieces back together using t connections fit 2 sections of pipe into the side holes on a pvc t connection so the top hole points up add another t connection to the end so the top hole points up and put the third section in the side hole so you have a long horizontal pipe once everything fits apply pvc cement around the end of each pipe section and push it back into the t connection to secure it repeat the process with the other sections of pipe 4 x research source you can buy pvc cement from your local hardware store a t connection has 2 holes on the side and 1 on the top so you can join multiple pipes together you don t have to glue the pieces together if you don t want to but it reduces the risk of your frame falling apart while you re using it attach the pvc pieces to the sides of your boat with conduit clamps get conduit clamps that match the size of your pipes to ensure a tight fit against your boat hold the length of pipe against the inside of your boat about 6 inches 15 cm from the top edge measure every 2 feet 61 cm along the length of pipe and make marks on your boat so you know where to place the clamps screw in the clamps with an electric screwdriver so they re secured to your boat 5 x research source conduit clamps are rounded metal pieces that hold pipes in place so they don t move around and you can buy them from your local hardware store you can also screw the conduit clamps into the boat seats if it s easier than attaching them to the side of your boat if you re drilling through fiberglass then cover the area where you re making your hole with painter s tape before you start drilling so you don t accidentally crack or damage your boat 6 x research source add 2 ft 61 cm vertical pipes into the t connections cut 6 pieces of pvc pipe with your hacksaw so they re 2 feet 61 cm long push the end of each pipe into the top holes of the t connections so they stand up vertically against the walls of your boat make sure each piece is the same height or else the rest of your frame won t line up well mark each pipe so you know how far to push it in before applying pvc cement to the ends 7 x research source you can cut the pipes longer if you want to have more coverage from your blind put horizontal pvc supports between the tops of the vertical pipes fit 4 way pipe connections on top of the vertical pipes so 2 holes run along the length of the boat and 1 hole points toward the opposite side use the measurement you took for the inside width of your boat to cut 3 sections of pipe to fit between each side of the frame push the ends of each pipe into the 4 way connections on top of the vertical supports so they span the width of your boat 8 x research source don t glue your horizontal supports in place since you won t be able to easily take your frame apart when you aren t using it if you ever want to take your frame apart remove the horizontal connections to fold the pipes into your boat the conduit connections allow you to rotate the pipes and collapse your blind when you aren t using it install a top rail to the frame the top rail uses the same size pieces as the bottom pieces of your frame take your length measurement from earlier and cut out 6 new sections of pvc pipe with your hacksaw to fit between the 4 way connections push the new pipe sections into the 4 way connections so they span the length of the boat and support your frame 9 x research source screw u shaped metal brackets in the 4 corners of your boat get u shaped mounting brackets that are at least 3 4 inch 1 9 cm wide place your first bracket on top of the frame in the back of your boat near the motor and drive a screw through it to secure it put the second bracket directly across from the first one on the opposite side of the boat place the last 2 brackets at the front of your boat before it starts to narrow and screw them in so they run parallel with the back brackets 10 x research source you can also attach the brackets to any boat seats or platforms if it s easier for you if you re drilling through fiberglass cover the area with painter s tape first so you don t crack or damage the boat 11 x research source cut 4 pieces of metal conduit that match the inside width of your boat measure the distance between the center of one of your brackets to the opposite inside edge of your boat use 1 2 in 1 3 cm metal conduit and mark the lengths so you know where to make your cuts secure a pipe cutter onto the conduit on your mark and rotate it completely around keep rotating the pipe cutter until it makes a clean cut and continue until you have 4 pieces that are the same length 12 x research source you can buy metal conduits from your local home improvement or hardware store drill holes in one end and the center of each conduit use a drill with a bit meant for boring through metal measure in 1 inch 2 5 cm from one end of each conduit and drill your hole completely through the other side then find the midpoint of each conduit and drill another hole through the pipe drill from the same side of your pipe for each hole or else your frame won t fit together 13 x research source be careful not to bend or damage the conduit while you re drilling it attach the conduits to the brackets with nuts and bolts place the end of the conduit with the drilled hole so it s in the center of the bracket on your boat push a 1 1 2 in 3 8 cm hex bolt through the holes on the bracket and the conduit and screw a nut onto the other side test pivoting the conduit up and down in the bracket to make sure it moves smoothly attach the rest of the conduits to the other brackets 14 x research source if the conduit doesn t move around easily then try loosening the nut and bolt so it can freely rotate attach 90 degree angle pieces to the top of each conduit with screw couplings get 4 90 degree conduit pieces that are the same diameter as your other pieces put a screw coupling onto the end of one of your conduits and fit the 90 degree angle into the other side point the angled piece down the length of the boat towards the other bracket on the same side tighten the screws on the coupling to secure the pieces together repeat the process for each other conduit 15 x research source you can buy screw couplings from your local hardware store or online secure horizontal sections of conduit between the angled pieces measure the length between the open ends of the angled conduit pieces and cut 2 more pieces of your straight conduit to fit between them push a screw coupling onto the ends of the angled pieces and push the straight conduits onto the other side secure the horizontal sections in place by tightening the screws 16 x research source place wire lock pins through the center holes on the conduit to hold them in place lift up both sides of your frame so they intersect and make an x shape on each end line up the holes in the centers of the conduits and push a lock pin through them secure the end of the lock pin in place so your frame doesn t fall down when you re ready to take your frame apart pull out the lock pins to collapse them 17 x research source you can buy lock pins from your local hardware store or online paint the frame a matte brown or green color use spray paint that s meant for exterior use and the material you built your frame from make sure to use a matte brown or dark green so it blends in with the rest of your camouflage hold the spray paint 6 inches 15 cm from the frame and apply a thin coat in short bursts once you apply the first coat wait about 15 minutes before applying another coat 18 x research source cover your boat with plastic or cardboard so you don t accidentally get paint on it you don t need to paint the frame if you don t want but it will make it more difficult to see cut camouflage netting to fit on the sides of your boat measure from the top of the frame down to the bottom of your boat with your measuring tape use a utility knife to cut through camouflage netting that s the same length or slightly longer than the sides of your boat make sure the netting is long enough to cover the entire side of your boat so you re completely camouflaged 19 x research source you can buy camouflage netting from hunting and outdoors stores you can cut the camouflage into smaller sections so it s easier to attach to your frame but be sure to use about 1 2 inches 2 5 5 1 cm extra on each side so you re able to overlap the pieces hang the netting on the frame using zip ties hold the netting up to the top bar of the frame so it extends 3 4 inches 7 6 10 2 cm above it and loop a zip tie through the netting pull the zip tie tight against your frame to secure the netting in place attach a zip tie every 6 inches 15 cm along the top edge of the frame so the netting doesn t come undone work your way around the boat to completely camouflage it 20 x research source leave a small 2 ft 61 cm window at the front and back of your boat so you can still navigate easily attach blind grass onto the netting if you want additional camouflage blind grass simulates the natural plant life on the water and can help conceal your boat more lay out the blind grass on the outside of the netting and secure it in place every 6 12 inches 15 30 cm with zip ties make sure the bottom of the blind grass extends past the top and bottom of your boat to hide it better 21 x research source you can blind grass online or from hunting specialty stores you can also use dead leaves and branches of the natural plant life in your area if you want,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to make a canoe,for thousands of years people have been relying on canoes for water travel in many cases these were simple canoes and carving knowledge was passed from generation to generation at its most basic a canoe can be dug out from a large log however you can make a more sophisticated version using strips of wood either way you need to plan and have access to good basic tools,purchase a strip canoe kit research a reputable canoe company and select the model of strip canoe you d like to put together place your order and wait for the kit to arrive your kit should contain the wood for your canoe the layout and instructions some hardware and fiberglass cloth you may require other tools to actually assemble your strip canoe 1 x research source read the instructions this will ensure that you are completely prepared make sure you have all the necessary tools and equipment to put together your canoe this may take several hours depending on the difficulty of the canoe you ve chosen take your time to really read and visualize the instructions if you don t understand a step or two contact the company for assistance this will save you time in the long run build a saw back this is what you will build your strip canoe on place a long thin table or platform on top of saw horses or blocks the platform or piece of wood should be completely level your sawback will probably be 12 to 15 long and will act as the skeleton around which you ll assemble your strip canoe 2 x research source cut out the forms hopefully your kit contains molds or outlines for forms forms act as a support system to shape and hold strips that are stretched and attached to your sawback trace the forms onto particle board and use a saw to cut them out the forms will appear mushroom shaped when stacked the wider end will be placed on the bottom of your sawhorse or the bottom of your canoe some kits may include pre cut forms in this case simply spread them out in the correct order and begin to attach them to the sawback apply the forms to the sawback you ll want to attach the forms to station blocks small 1 wide pieces of wood make sure the wider part of the form is connected to the station block then attach the station blocks flat on the sawback using drywall screws attach your forms station blocks about 12 from each other and make sure they are evenly centered this will keep your boat aligned attach the ends depending on whether or not your kit includes them you may have to cut 2 quarter circle sections that will hold the shape at the end of your canoe 3 x research source again use drywall screws to attach the ends to sawback make sure the ends are completely centered if you have to cut them trace the outline onto plywood and use a saw to cut the sections out cover the ends and forms with masking tape you ll be attaching wood strips to the ends and you don t want them to accidentally adhere to the ends covering the ends and forms with masking tape prevents the strips from sticking and should make it easier to remove when you take the forms and ends out you need to cover the edges of the forms since glue from the wood strips could cause the strips to stick to your forms the tape will make it easier to remove the forms spread carpenter s glue on the edges of your wood strips strip canoes are edge glued which is what will eventually allow them to hold shape while you ll attach the strips to the forms and end of the boat using staples the glue between the strips will create the shape you may want to wear gloves when applying glue and stripping the canoe strip the canoe start stapling the thin wooden strips directly to the ends and forms lay your first few strips across what will become the top of your canoe this will be closest to the sawback alternate stapling strips on both sides this will keep your boat even and centered make sure the strips are placed snugly next to one another this allows the glued edges to come into contact and seal with the other strip maintaining the canoe s shape continue working your way up the sides keep stapling and placing the edge glued strips across both sides you will be working your way up to what will become the bottom of your canoe if you need extra support while stapling the strips into place use clamps remove the staples once you ve attached all your strips and allowed the glue to dry carefully remove the staples from the ends and forms use a pair of pliers and pull straight out 4 x research source take care not to damage or dent the wood by twisting the staples as you pull them out plane excess material at the ends of your canoe you may have an extra bit of wood sticking out at the ends use a block plane to trim off where the strips stick out if you notice any very rough strips of wood that stand out use the plane to make it even and flush with the canoe sand the canoe use a coarse sandpaper and sand with the grain of the wood go over the entire canoe using long even strokes make sure not to spend too long in one spot or you may develop a weak area in the canoe replace your sandpaper when you notice it starting to become dull this will save you time and ensure that the canoe is evenly sanded 5 x research source remove the canoe from the forms first take out the drywall screws that are attached to the stations and sawback you should be able to carefully pull the forms out of the canoe while turning the canoe out and off of the sawback the plastic tape will make removing the forms easier you will also want assistance in holding the canoe and gently turning it over as you remove the forms seal your strip canoe many strip canoes use a combination of fiberglass epoxy and varnish to seal and reinforce the wood strips follow the individual package instructions regarding specific application dry time and safety precautions wait for your epoxy or varnish to completely dry and seal before taking your canoe to the water determine what kind of tree you want to use research what kind of trees grow in local forests then decide which kind you d like to use for your canoe look for a sturdy stout tree that is straight and symmetrical dugout canoes are often made from cedar willow spruce pine cottonwood and redwood traditionally they were made with whatever was growing close to a river source 6 x research source select your actual tree walk through a nearby forest and find a tree look for one that s large and tall enough to make into a canoe remember you ll only be using the long trunk of the tree you won t want to use branches you can cut down a tree especially one that s already dead or you can use a tree that s already fallen cut the tree into a log if the tree is still standing have someone help to first cut the tree down then make two clean cuts at the ends of your log make sure no branches are growing out from any part of your log your log should be as long as you d like your canoe to be make sure you have permission to cut down a tree even if it s dead if you re unsure how long you d like to make your canoe cut a longer log that way you can cut down and make a shorter canoe if you choose decide where you ll work given the enormous size of your log you may want to work in the field or forest where you cut your log this will save you from having to move it if you decide to move your log to an off site work station be sure to get help and use proper lifting equipment logs can weigh hundreds of pounds and cause serious injury if moved carelessly strip the bark from your log use whatever tool feels most comfortable to you a shovel might be your best bet for removing large sections of bark quickly or you can use an axe or an adz to chip away the bark which should easily break off bark scraps make good kindling for fires keep them if you plan on camping or making fires draw an outline on your log using a pencil draw along the sides just how your want your ends to taper on the top of your log draw where the ends taper and mark where the center of the boat will be the center outline will look a bit like an oval if you suspect it could rain and wash away your outline consider lightly chiseling in your outline using a small chisel and hammer create a flat bottom for your canoe make perpendicular cuts across the length of the log you ll then use a chainsaw adz or axe to split out all the sections between the cuts 7 x research source roll the log over you ll want to have help and some rope to carefully roll the flat bottom onto the ground you should now see a rounded part at the top create a flat top for your canoe again make perpendicular cuts across the length of the log and then split out all the sections between the cuts don t go too deep since you ll be cutting into the sides of your canoe 8 x research source cut out the ends you can use either a chainsaw to crudely remove large chunks of wood or you can use an axe or ads to chop away as much wood as you lik usually the ends are tapered into points this allows your canoe to move in either direction 9 x research source cut away the center look to your outline and leave at least 5 8 to 1 on the sides be careful to stop at least 2 to 3 from the bottom of the log this will prevent you from accidentally cutting holes into your canoe while it might seem like you re cutting out too much wood you need to in order to reduce the weight of your canoe removing the bulk of the wood will help its buoyancy shape the ends you can use a smaller elbow adz for more control gradually cut and smooth the ends into your desired shape cut the sides of the canoe at this point your canoe probably still looks boxy you can cut the top sides into a gentle swoop to reduce the weight of your canoe and give it an elegant look detail the center of the canoe although you ve removed the bulk of the wood from the center of your canoe you still need to take a smaller knife adz or axe and clean up the edges try to make the center as uniform as possible remember not to remove too much wood from the bottom or you might cut a hole sand your canoe smooth use heavy grit sandpaper and rub your sandpaper over the entire surface of your canoe work the sandpaper with the grain of the wood be sure to blow away any sawdust before sealing your canoe seal the canoe use a spar varnish and apply multiple coats be sure to use a light sandpaper in between

how to build a marina,a marina is a must for any maritime community it allows for easy mooring of boats and can be built on various bodies of water including rivers lakes and bays marina s can also be lucrative often offering boat rentals food fuel and other boating essentials,find a suitable location preferably somewhere with access to a deep harbor and solid sea floor check with local authorities before beginning construction of your marina often waterways are strictly controlled due to environmental regulations construct a marina shop this will contain offices and a store for your marina suit your building design and size to the clientele strongly consider using all weather carpeting build a dock this is the core of your marina where many smaller boats can be docked in areas without significant water level change some lakes and rivers fixed docks can be installed in oceans where tides change water levels significantly a floating dock may be necessary add moorings for larger boats make sure moorings are arranged to give each necessary berth which will shift as winds and tides change even in a motorized boat create an area for maintenance this should include facilities for fueling oil changes and other regular maintenance this will require a boat lift and an isolated area in case of fuel or oil leaks check federal regulations once you have the essential consider expanding this may include restaurants a water park pool or wake boarding park here is the opportunity to turn your marina from simply a place to moor a boat to a true travel destination,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to become a boat builder,boat builders are responsible for designing and assembling watercraft that can hold up to harsh conditions out on the water this includes anything from small fishing boats to ornate superyachts fit with the most elaborate features available there are no specific educational requirements necessary but most boat builders attend a 1 year study program before entering an apprenticeship plenty of successful builders have first hand experience from operating or working on boats and may go on to making custom designs if you re a creative person that likes working with your hands boat building could be the perfect job for you,take math and science classes to prepare you for construction work although boat building doesn t have any specific educational requirements there are a few subjects you can study to prepare for work engineering classes are very useful for designing and building things from raw materials algebra geometry and physics are also very important for determining how to build something that holds up against water 1 x research source start taking any relevant classes while you re in high school if engineering or physics classes aren t available consider reading about them on your own until you enter a training or apprenticeship program communications classes are also helpful since building involves a lot of teamwork especially if you re a lead builder business classes are also worth taking if you plan on running a company or selling your own boats apply to a college that teaches boat building check with schools near you to see what kinds of courses they have available there are some schools that focus specifically on boat building some community colleges offer broader degree programs meant to prepare you for work in the boat building industry if you re able to get an education from either of these sources you will have a better shot of finding employment 2 x research source having a high school diploma or ged helps but it usually is not required to take classes earn an undergraduate degree in 1 2 years the average boat building program only lasts for a year some schools offer an optional second year of study for students that want to pursue an associate s degree it depends on what options are available but the additional year of study teaches you a lot more about the intricacies of building quality boats these programs teach you about the manufacturing process and some of the science and math that goes into it 3 x research source boat building programs can be hard to find even if you live near water anticipate needing to travel in order to attend classes be sure to check the course offerings each college has some of them have programs for fiberglass and composite boats and a separate one for wooden boats speak with the school s academic advisor to ensure you take the right classes they will also help transition you to an apprenticeship or employment after you graduate complete a 4 year naval architecture degree if you plan on designing boats boat builders assemble boats but architects design them from scratch because of all the rules and regulations that go into making safe boats these programs take longer to complete than regular boat building courses a good degree program includes classes on subjects like engineering physics calculus and programming it enables you to build something safe and seaworthy no matter what type of boat you want to build 4 x research source although degree programs focus on designing safe boats you will still have plenty of opportunities to contribute to the construction process get a 4 year degree in marine engineering to design a wide variety of boats marine engineers build everything from small rowboats to giant passenger ships and carriers they work with naval architects to bring ship blueprints to life the job requires a 4 year degree in marine engineering along with work experience and government licensing if you re interested in working with the military or designing a specific type of watercraft marine engineering may be right for you 5 x trustworthy source us bureau of labor statistics u s government agency that collects and reports labor related information go to source some engineers work on sea structures like offshore platforms and drilling equipment an engineer has to have a good understanding of naval design to ensure these structures are safe engineers have an advanced education in math science and drafting calculus and physics are a couple of important subjects required for the work 6 x trustworthy source us bureau of labor statistics u s government agency that collects and reports labor related information go to source contact boat building companies to apply for work locate any boat building companies in your area that are looking for new hires you can usually find some through a quick search online for something like boat building jobs fill out an application online or in person include your resume listing your educational background and any relevant building experience you happen to have 7 x research source look for any events where boat building companies will be present some places have tall ships on display for instance while others host volunteer events for people who want to help restore boats call different builders to ask about their employment opportunities if you aren t satisfied by what you see online your school can also help link you to different companies apply to boat building companies for apprenticeship opportunities search for different boat building companies and note any of them that have openings for new workers many companies train aspiring boat builders and hire them full time afterward you don t have to pay for the training and still receive a paycheck for the work you do so it is a good option if you re unable to study for a degree these positions can fill up quickly so don t be discouraged if you are unable get one right away 8 x research source applying for an apprenticeship is the same as applying for a regular position with a building company many companies have online applications but you could also call or visit them in person to apply even people who have no formal education or training are eligible for apprenticeships however having an educational background increases your chances of getting hired finish the apprenticeship after 4 years during your apprenticeship you work under a senior boat builder they are responsible for training you on how to build quality watercraft you may start out helping the builder with simple tasks like moving supplies and cleaning up eventually you learn to operate machinery and join materials together to form a boat s frame 9 x research source note that if you have a strong background in construction skills you may be able to speed through or skip the apprenticeship it s very rare though train for specialty work if you want a specific role in building boats are made through the combined efforts of builders with many different types of skills in a company it isn t unusual for some workers to handle different parts of the building process than others one group may take care of the welding for instance while another handles the upholstery electrical wiring and so on if you like a specific role more than the others consider studying it and practicing it to become an expert 10 x research source the boat company you work for may offer additional training for specialty positions acquire any certifications necessary to work as a boat builder boat builders usually do not need any sort of license but some areas may require you to get certificates these certificates are meant to show that you went through the proper schooling and apprenticeship to become a boat builder certification depends on where you live so check local regulations for more information 11 x research source for example if you live in new zealand or australia you may have to get a certificate in boat building marine coatings interiors or another subject depending on your specialty certificates are usually given out after you complete an apprenticeship speak with an academic advisor or your country s maritime office to learn about certification study welding and other trades to improve your construction skills learning skills can help you get hired as a boat builder even if you don t have much experience with boats welding is always a useful skill to have since many modern boats are made by securing metal together getting experience in joinery or joining pieces of wood together is a good skill to have if you re interested in wooden boats some other skills to study include engineering plumbing electrical and restoration work 12 x research source if you can t find a boat building course to take try attending a technical school first to master something like welding employers are more likely to hire you if you have trade skills although boat building experience is preferable employers can always train you as needed these skills can be practiced on land whether you re building houses or repairing vehicles even if you don t have much experience with boats these skills transfer fairly seamlessly to boat construction learn computer assisted design cad software if you re interested in boat design while some companies still use paper and pencil the vast majority of them design blueprints through cad you can use a program like autocad to design boats on a computer these programs can be tricky to master so consider gaining experience before you re ready for professional work if you are able to get used to cad programs you can get a better idea of how well built boats are made and even advance to design work 13 x research source many technical schools offer classes on cad look into some of them if you think you might like making your own blueprints look for free online classes and tutorials that can help you get accustomed to using free cad software spend time sailing to teach yourself how boats work being a builder means knowing boats inside and out the best way to gain experience is to spend time near the water if you are able to ride on boats as often as you can and even try steering your own use your time out on the water to get used to the various parts of a boat how they work and what you need to do to repair them in an emergency 14 x research source boat building companies often look for candidates with experience even if you don t have a formal education you may be able to get on the job training just because you have been out to sea before work on boats to gain more direct experience in boat maintenance when it comes to boats there are many different roles you can take on without being directly involved in the building process try going down to your local dock or marina in search of opportunities some builders start out by cleaning boats or working as a deckhand others learn to captain private boats 15 x research source being around boats allows you learn more about them you will be able to see how boats work and what goes into repairs and maintenance be on the lookout for volunteer opportunities as well sailing associations sometimes hire volunteer crews to take care of chores for instance build your own boat from scratch for a challenge there is no better way to improve as a boat builder than by getting your hands dirty building a boat at home is difficult but very rewarding it requires plenty of space and money so it isn t for everyone however you can successfully construct a small boat and take it out on the water 16 x research source most homemade boats are built from wood so design and joinery skills help a lot other skills like welding can come in handy if you plan on using metal homemade boats tend to be small but reliable if you are able to do this you can learn a lot about boat design it makes employers more likely to hire

how to run a boat motor out of water,flushing a boat motor by running it out of water is a routine maintenance task running the engine without a water source for any length of time will cause damage so you ll need to attach a hose to the motor s water intakes some newer motors have built in attachments that accept a hose nozzle if your motor doesn t you ll need a set of motor flusher muffs turn on the water before starting the engine then run it for 5 to 10 minutes or according to the manufacturer s recommendations 1 x research source,read your manual before starting the motor out of water check the manual to find out where your intakes are located and whether they have built in attachments for a garden hose if not you ll need a set of motor muffs 2 x research source most manufacturers recommendations for flushing or running a motor out of water are similar however you should still check the specific procedure for your model screw the hose directly into the motor if it has a built in attachment with the engine lowered into the vertical position not tilted in the tow position locate the water intakes on the sides of the lower unit screw the hose nozzle into one of the intakes your manual will most likely recommend covering the other intake with heavy tape 3 x research source purchase motor muffs at a boating store or online if you need motor muffs you can purchase a set for under 10 usd at a marina sporting goods store or online they look like earmuffs connected by a long v shaped rod 4 x research source wet the muffs to get a better seal many boat owners like to splash the insides of the muffs with water before attaching them to the motor a better seal can help prevent the muffs from sliding off while the engine s running 5 x research source clamp the muffs to the motor and stay clear of the propeller slide the muffs onto the motor s lower unit so they re aligned over the water intakes be sure to position the muffs so the connecting rod is located in front of the motor on the opposite side of the propeller 6 x research source while you should keep the engine in neutral while running it out of water you still need to be careful around the propeller injury or damage will result if the engine accidentally slips into gear and the connecting rod is on the propeller side of the motor screw the garden hose onto the muffs one of the muffs has a nozzle and the other is solid find the one with the nozzle then screw your garden hose into it double check that the connection is tight and that the muffs fit snugly over the motor s water intakes 7 x research source turn on the water after attaching the garden hose head to the faucet and turn on the water check your manual to see if it specifies a water pressure setting many manufacturers recommend setting it to about half pressure 8 x research source do not start the engine before turning on the water put the engine in neutral make sure the gearshift or throttle is in the neutral position the engine needs to be in neutral to start and should stay in neutral while you run it 9 x research source if you need to put the engine in gear to test the propeller s function use caution and make sure no people or objects go near the moving propeller start the engine depending on your engine type insert the key or pull the starter to engage the engine for some electric engines you ll also need to push and release a button after turning the key 10 x research source make sure the motor s water pump is working you should see a stream of water flowing out of the top of the motor if there s no overflow stream there s something wrong with your water pump 11 x research source if there s no stream turn off the engine immediately insert a thin wire into the outflow tube to check for debris start the engine again to see if that solved the problem if there s still no outflow you will likely need to have a mechanic replace your water pump 12 x research source run the engine for 10 minutes or according to the manual s instructions if you re flushing the motor most manufacturers recommend running it for 5 to 10 minutes if you re running the engine for another purpose such as to test its function run it for as long as your maintenance task requires 13 x research source don t run the engine unattended keep an eye on the muffs and make sure they don t slip off of the water intakes 14 x research source regardless of your task it s unlikely that you ll need to run it more than 10 to 15 minutes turn off the engine before turning off the water after about 10 minutes turn the key or close the throttle to turn off the engine turn off the water only after disengaging the engine running the engine without a water source for just a moment could cause damage 15 x research source unscrew the hose from the muffs or built in attachment after turning off the water remove the garden hose from the muffs or motor s water intake coil it up and put it away 16 x research source remove the muffs if you re using them if necessary slide the muffs off of the motor s lower unit store them in your boat house garage or other handy spot so you can flush your motor after your next outing 17 x research source let water drain before tilting the engine keep the engine down for 30 to 60 minutes so water drains from the powerhead after letting it drain lift the motor into the tilted position cover the boat and tow it into your garage or boat house or store it as you prefer 18 x research source,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to maintain an outboard motor,a little tlc and preventive boat motor maintenance will help with safe boating and keep your motor running well for years to come this article will explain the basic steps you can take to extend the life of your outboard motor,flush out the engine at home after every outing this doesn t just apply to saltwater adventures but to fresh water outings as well if you have an older motor or one based upon an older design you should buy a set of flushing earmuffs two flexible rubber seals attached to a metal clamp one side can be attached to a garden hose while the other is solid and will serve to plug a water intake slip the apparatus onto the lower unit where the water is taken in and then attach the earmuff to a garden hose if there are additional water intakes that are not covered by the earmuffs use duct tape to cover them 1 x research source attach a garden hose to the earmuffs or mount and turn the water on newer motor designs already have mounts and so the earmuffs are unnecessary start up the engine the water pump will then flush out the system practice safe boating and remember to stay clear of the prop and keep the motor out of gear while flushing the motor check the water pump to make sure it has good water flow carefully put your finger through the stream of water exiting the motor it should be warm but not hot if the output is not strong you may have some debris stuck in the outflow tube immediately shut down the engine to prevent overheating and damage if the flow tube is obstructed insert a small piece of wire into the tube and work it back and forth again while the engine remains off start the engine again and check the output if that doesn t solve the problem you may need a new water pump impeller after flushing the engine disconnect the fuel line if applicable disconnect the fuel line if the boat is going to be stored for an extended period of time you should allow the engine to burn the small amount of fuel that is in the carburetor old fuel can gum up an engine and the best way to keep the motor running at a high level is to burn off all fuel remaining in the mechanism 2 x research source be advised that if you own a two stroke motor with more than one carburetor the top carburetor will run dry first while all of the cylinders will continue to run without fuel the top cylinder will not be getting any lubrication listen closely as the engine may get louder as the top cylinder begins to overheat also beware of any burning smell that is unusual for your engine be sure to turn off the key and if you have a battery switch turn it off just to make sure that all the moving parts are going to stay put for the next few minutes of cleaning 3 x research source take the engine cowling off and check for fuel or water leaks there should be no water or other liquids moving freely about the engine compartment if you find leaks consult a boating mechanic 4 x research source wipe down and spray all accessible mechanical components and moving parts with an anti corrosive some of the best options are lubricants such as wd 40 or quick lube be sure to lubricate or grease all the moving parts such as the pivots shift mechanism throttle cables carburetor valves etc place the cowling back onto its fittings clean it off and then cover the whole motor in a canvas or plastic covering for the duration of storage replace spark plugs and plug wires as needed there is no set rule regarding the appropriate life cycle of your spark plugs if you are boating regularly or not maintaining your engine well they will wear out faster 5 x research source if your engine does not rev up adequately or had begun burning unusually high quantities of fuel you may have a spark problem you can check your spark plugs by unscrewing them using a wrench from the engine and mounting them on a spark tester to change them first unplug the plug wires in most cases they will pop off then remove the plugs using the appropriate size of wrench the new plugs can simply screwed into place and the plug wires snapped on over their ends 6 x research source many people like to replace the plugs and plug wires together plug wires are not especially long lived it is better to replace them at the same time as the plugs than have them burn out while you are on the water make sure to memorize which plug wire is associated with each plug they must be re attached in precisely the same arrangement check regularly for water in the fuel water in an engine can dramatically decrease engine performance and damage certain components such as spark plugs 7 x research source ethanol is a common alcohol fuel additive but it has a tendency to act as a solvent and break down seals gaskets and hoses all of which can contribute to water intake try to avoid using fuel with ethanol if possible 8 x research source check the fuel line fittings make sure they are properly seated and don t leak obviously fuel leaks in a tight hot engine compartment are incredibly dangerous you must pay close attention to fuel lines which can corrode over time replace the water pump impeller every two years annually if it is used in saltwater the impeller is a component of the pump and it circulates water and prevents the engine from overheating however these tend to become jammed with muck over time and should be replaced regularly the procedure is fairly simple and straightforward for most outboard motors 9 x research source unscrew the cover plate of the impeller housing after loosening the screws pull the cover plate off remove the old impeller use a pair of pliers to grip the impeller by the blade and pull it off of its shaft clear any debris from the housing slide a new impeller onto the shaft and screw the cover plate back into place make sure that you only use fresh fuel boat motors are especially sensitive to grime and the impurities in fuels as fuels age they begin to break into their component parts and become unusable at the conclusion of a boating season it is imperative that you empty your fuel tanks and lines 10 x research source dispose of the fuel and oils responsibly take them to the nearest recycling depot for proper disposal,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to change your mercruiser engine oil,changing your mercruiser engine oil is not as difficult as you might think having the right tools makes this job much easier,read your owners manual and its safety precautions in general you need to change your oil every year or every 100 hours of use whichever comes first 1 x research source visually inspect your engine and check the oil before starting make sure the prop has been removed and that no people or pets are near the stern drive or prop before starting the motor check for fuel or fuel vapors outside or in a well ventilated area to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning to people 2 x trustworthy source centers for disease control and prevention main public health institute for the us run by the dept of health and human services go to source make sure your engine has a water supply before starting be prepared for spilt oil cover your floor and cushions with old towels or blankets start your motor and let it warm up this will warm up the oil and make it much easier to suck it up and out of your dipstick tube 3 x research source turn the motor off after the engine has run long enough to reach operating temperature turn the motor off and let it cool for a few minutes remove the dipstick and thread the oil hand pump onto the end of the dipstick tube 4 x research source if you are using an electric oil changer bucket hook up the hose to the tube and attach the pumps wires to the battery red is positive and black is negative suck out your oil into a container mer cruiser dipstick tubes are also oil withdraw tubes you can suck all the oil out of the engine through the dipstick tube this requires the use of either a small hand pump part 802899a1 oil pump which can be purchased online or you can buy a more expensive oil changer pump bucket assembly from a marine supply store about 160 00 and up replace the oil filter use the correct filter wrench and remove the old filter turn it counterclockwise as viewed from the bottom end of the filter in some cases the filter might be difficult to remove this is usually because it had been over tightened when installed a good wrench and patience usually prevails but in some cases you have to drive a large screwdriver through the body of the filter to get it off once the filter is removed use a lint free towel and wipe off and inspect the filter mounting area make sure that the old filter o ring has been removed from the engine compare the size and type of the threaded hole of the new filter to the old filter to make sure you have the correct type coat the o ring on the new filter with clean oil 5 x research source thread the new filter into place until hand tight use the filter wrench to tighten another 3 4 of a turn and no more over tightening the filter makes it very difficult to be removed look up your engine oil capacity in the owner s manual or on the capacity decal on the engine most inline 4 cylinder engines take 4 5 quarts 6 x research source most v6 engines take about 5 quarts most v8 small blocks take about 5 quarts and big block v8 s can take up to seven quarts depending on the exact model fill the engine with the correct amount of oil 7 x research source newer mer cruiser engines use a color coding system to locate and identify the oil fill cap and dipstick mer cruiser uses yellow to identify oil service points let the motor sit for 5 minutes before checking the level on the dipstick this will allow the new oil to drip all the way down into the oil pan remember that the filter will hold some oil too after you are done filling install your oil fill cap and perform a general inspection on the engine make sure the filter has been installed and that you have cleared the engine area of all rags and tools supply a water supply to the motor and start the engine immediately inspect the oil filter while the engine is running look for any oil leaks go to the helm and observe your oil pressure gauge for a proper reading let the engine warm up to operating temp turn off the motor and let it sit for 5 minutes the manual that came with my mercruiser says to check the oil level with the boat at rest in the water remove and wipe off the dipstick and check the oil level again 8 x research source add more oil if needed in general one quart adds about 3 8 on the dipstick this can vary from model to model though clean up your mess and go boating,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
how to mount a trolling motor,invented in 1934 by o g schmidt electric trolling motors allow fishermen to maneuver their boats at slower speeds than trolling speed with an outboard motor and with greater control than with a paddle or oars they are also an option for propelling boats across lakes where no wake rules are in effect or in most lakes where gasoline powered outboard motors are not allowed trolling motors are available for both freshwater and saltwater fishing and can be mounted in 1 of 3 places on the transom stern on the engine itself or on the bow following are instructions on how to mount a trolling motor in each of these places,open the mounting bracket clamps transom mounted trolling motors have 1 or 2 clamps built into the mounting bracket to hold the motor in place turning the clamps counterclockwise to the left will open them slip the motor over the transom the trolling motor should be placed as close to the center of the stern as possible without interfering with the operation of the main motor if there is one the top of the mounting bracket should be flush with the top of the stern tighten the clamps turn the clamps clockwise to the right as far as they will go so that the motor won t vibrate loose while in operation transom mounted trolling motors should be positioned so that the center of the motor section is at least 9 inches 22 5 cm under water while the motor is running to keep the propeller from breaking the water s surface this produces noise that can spook fish place the mounting bracket on top of the engine s anti cavitation plate with the motor up the anti cavitation is a horizontal plate above the propeller on either an outboard motor or the outboard unit of an inboard outboard motor that keeps the propeller from breaking the water s surface as it pushes the boat forward the mounting bracket is designed so that when the boat is on plane the bow lifts out of the water as the boat skims across its surface the trolling motor does break the water s surface your anti cavitation plate must run at a depth of at least 13 inches 32 5 cm below the waterline so that the trolling motor will run at least 6 inches 15 cm below the waterline while in operation mark holes to be drilled through the anti cavitation plate use the mount itself as a template for this drill the holes for the mounting bolts use a drill bit sharp enough and tough enough to drill through the metal of the anti cavitation plate place the mounting bracket on top of the anti cavitation plate again insert the mounting bolts and tighten them this will secure the trolling motor engine mounted trolling motors are designed only for v hull or tri hull boats that go on plane they are not designed for use with pontoon boats or with sailboats separate the trolling motor assembly from the mount base bow mounted electric trolling motors are designed to be used on boats with flat raised forward decks these types of decks are most commonly found on bass boats which are designed for fishing for largemouth bass in shallow water around weeds and stumps where precise boat control is necessary choose the place on the deck where the base should be attached you should place the mount base somewhere where it can accommodate the motor both when it is pulling the boat and when it is stowed on deck while the boat s main motor pushes it through the water the base should also be placed where it provides enough clearance for the motor to break away from the base if the motor uses a breakaway mount and where the mounting screws can penetrate the deck but not the hull mark the holes to be drilled into the deck use the mount base as a template for this drill the holes for the mounting bolts use a sharp bit to drill to a depth of 1 4 inch 6 5 mm and clear out any debris after drilling if the boat is made of fiberglass you ll have to countersink the holes thread a bolt through each hole in the mount base slip a rubber washer onto each bolt underneath the mount base you ll want to hold the washers in position with your fingers as you move the mount base over the holes you drilled in the deck if this is too difficult place the washers over the drilled holes place the base over the drilled holes slipping the bolts through each hole check to see that the base rests level against the deck surface if it doesn t you ll need to add more rubber washers under those bolts where the base wobbles to level it the base needs to rest evenly so that the motor can be raised onto the deck and locked down for transport without binding thread a steel washer and retaining nut onto each bolt tighten the nuts to secure the base secure the motor assembly to the base bow mounted trolling motors should run at least 5 inches 12 5 cm below the water level to allow for rough water if you fish from a standing position while running the motor a depth of 12 inches 30 cm is recommended,Cars-and-Other-Vehicles
